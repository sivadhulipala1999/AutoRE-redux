9813009|t|The guanosine monophosphate reductase gene is conserved in rats and its expression increases rapidly in brown adipose tissue during cold exposure.
9813009|a|Non-shivering thermogenesis is required for survival of rodents during cold stress. Uncoupling protein-1 acts in brown adipose tissue (BAT) to transport protons, thus dissipating the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This permits respiration uncoupled from ATP synthesis. UCP-1 function is inhibited by the binding of purine nucleotides, with GTP/GDP being more potent than ATP/ADP. We used a cDNA subtraction analysis to identify cDNAs rapidly induced by cold exposure. One of these encodes rat guanosine monophosphate reductase (GMP-r). This was surprising in that previous data had suggested that this enzyme was absent in rodents. Rat GMP-r is 96% identical to human GMP-r, and its mRNA is increased 30-fold in BAT within 6 h of cold exposure. The gene is also expressed (but not cold-responsive) in muscle and kidney, but not in white fat. We speculate that the physiological function of the marked increase in BAT GMP-r during cold stress may be to deplete the brown adipocyte of guanine nucleotides, converting them to IMP, thus permitting enhanced UCP-1 function. This is a previously unrecognized regulatory aspect of thermogenesis, an essential physiological response of rodents to cold.

9335263|t|Beta-amyloid and ionophore A23187 evoke tau hyperphosphorylation by distinct intracellular pathways: differential involvement of the calpain/protein kinase C system.
9335263|a|SH-SY-5Y human neuroblastoma cells were treated with 22 microM of a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 25-35 of beta-amyloid (betaA) or 3 microM calcium ionophore A23187 in culture medium containing 1.8 mM extracellular calcium. Both agents increased tau immunoreactivity towards antibodies (PHF-1, ALZ-50) that recognize epitopes common with paired helical filaments (PHFs) and towards an antibody (5E2) that recognized a phosphate-independent tau epitope. However, only ionophore increased immunoreactivity with an additional phosphate-dependent antibody (AT-8) that recognized an epitope of tau when phosphorylated, and induced a corresponding decrease in immunoreactivity towards an additional antibody (Tau-1) that recognizes the same site when that site is not phosphorylated. Moreover, the ionophore-mediated increase in PHF-1 was blocked by EGTA, by the calpain inhibitor calpeptin and by the PKC inhibitor H7, while that evoked by betaA treatment was not inhibited by any of these treatments. Since ionophore-mediated calpain activation induces proteolytic PKC activation, we further examined the influence of PKC inhibition on betaA and ionophore-mediated PHF-1 induction. Antisense oligonucleotide-mediated downregulation of PKCepsilon in a stable transfectant SH-SY-5Y subclone diminished the ionophore-mediated, but not the betaA-mediated, increase in PHF-1 immunoreactivity. These data indicate specific differences in the intracellular cascade of events invoked by betaA and ionophore A23187. Moreover, although betaA invoked calcium influx in these cells, our findings further suggest that the induction of tau hyperphosphorylation by betaA may not be due to calcium influx.

5054466|t|The effect of carbohydrates on ammonium and ketoacid excretion during starvation.
5054466|a|The metabolic effects of oral ingestion of minute quantities of carbohydrate during prolonged starvation were studied in nine obese subjects. Measurements were made during a control period of total starvation, during the ingestion of 7.5 g carbohydrate daily, and finally during the ingestion of 15.0 g carbohydrate daily. Daily ketoacid excretion fell after carbohydrate ingestion and was significantly correlated (r = 0.62, P < 0.01) with the amount of carbohydrate administered. Despite this fall in ketoacids, the concentration of blood ketoacids, plasma free fatty acids, and serum insulin remained constant throughout the study. Urinary ammonium excretion, closely correlated with ketoacid output (r = 0.95, P < 0.001), also fell significantly after carbohydrate ingestion. No significant changes were present in extracellular or urinary pH. Urea nitrogen excretion did not change when urinary ammonium output fell. These results indicate that: the excretion of ketoacids and ammonium in starving man is exquisitely sensitive to minute amounts of ingested carbohydrate; the change in ketonuria appears to be due to increased renal ketoacid reabsorption after carbohydrate ingestion; and the nitrogen-sparing effect of reducing renal ammonium output in starvation can be dissociated from nitrogen sparing occurring because of changes in urine urea excretion.

1762061|t|Stimulation of sodium transport by duramycin in cultured human colonic epithelia.
1762061|a|Effects of two peptide antibiotics, duramycin and Ro 09-0198, on ion transport in cultured human colonic epithelia were investigated. Both peptides acted on the apical face of epithelial monolayers, causing an increase in ion transport measured as short circuit current. Concentration-response relationships were complex, because above a concentration of 2 to 5 microM, the peptides caused currents either to decline toward zero or become large and unstable. Ion substitution experiments showed that the majority of the current response was due to electrogenic sodium absorption. An outward chloride current could also be induced by duramycin, provided an outwardly directed chloride gradient was imposed. It was also shown that the peptides could increase [Ca]i, probably by creating entry sites in the apical face. Duramycin was also able to create large conductance (2000 pS) channels in "black" lipid bilayers. It is proposed that the antibiotics interact with membrane lipids in the apical faces of colonic epithelia to create artificial nonspecific ion channels. The prevailing electrochemical gradients which exist when the epithelia are bathed symmetrically in Krebs-Henseleit solution result in increased electrogenic sodium transport. No evidence was found for colonic epithelia that duramycin or Ro 09-0198 interacted specifically with either membrane channels or receptors to increase ion transport.

12682466|t|Effect of recombinant adeno-associated virus vector-mediated vascular endothelial growth factor gene transfer on wound healing after burn injury.
12682466|a|OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vector-mediated human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF165) transfer on experimental burn wounds. DESIGN: Randomized experiment. SETTING: Research laboratory. SUBJECTS: C57BL/6 male mice weighing 25-30 g. INTERVENTIONS: Mice were immersed in 80 degrees C water for 10 secs to achieve a partial-thickness scald burn. Animals were randomized to receive at two injection sites on the edge of the burn either 1011 copies of the rAAV-VEGF165 or the vector carrying the control and inert gene beta-galactosidase (rAAV-LacZ). On day 14 the animals were killed. Burn areas were used for histologic examination, evaluation of VEGF expression (immunohistochemistry) and VEGF wound content (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), determination of wound nitrite, and measurement of messenger RNA (mRNA) for endothelial and inducible nitric oxide synthase (eNOS and iNOS). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: rAAV-VEGF165 increased epithelial proliferation, angiogenesis, and maturation of the extracellular matrix. Furthermore, gene transfer enhanced VEGF expression, studied by immunohistochemistry, and the wound content of the mature protein (rAAV-LacZ, 11 +/- 5 pg/wound; rAAV-VEGF165, 104 +/- 7 pg/wound). Moreover, VEGF165 gene transfer increased wound content of nitrate. Finally, rAAV-VEGF165 administration enhanced the messenger RNA for eNOS (rAAV-VEGF165, 1.1 +/- 0.2 relative amount of eNOS mRNA; rAAV-LacZ, 0.66 +/- 0.3 relative amount of eNOS mRNA) and iNOS (rAAV-VEGF165, 0.8 +/- 0.09 relative amount of iNOS mRNA; rAAV-LacZ, 0.45 +/- 0.05 relative amount of iNOS mRNA). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that rAAV-VEGF gene transfer may be an effective therapeutic approach to improve clinical outcomes after thermal injury.

18305313|t|Thematic review series: sphingolipids. ISC1 (inositol phosphosphingolipid-phospholipase C), the yeast homologue of neutral sphingomyelinases.
18305313|a|Sphingolipid biosynthesis and breakdown in yeast share many homologies in their pathways with higher eukaryotes (Dickson, R. C. 1998. Sphingolipid functions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: comparison to mammals. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 67: 27-48). In mammals, ceramide can be generated through hydrolysis of sphingomyelin catalyzed by sphingomyelinase (SMase). To date, as many as five SMases have been identified molecularly, separated into three main groups: acid, alkaline, and neutral SMases (nSMases) (Marchesini, N., and Y. Hannun. 2004. Acid and neutral sphingomyelinases: roles and mechanisms of regulation. Biochem. Cell Biol. 82: 27-44). nSMase in mammals is represented by its homolog, inositol phosphosphingolipase C, codified by ISC1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) and Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) and by CSS1 (Can't Stop Synthesizing cell wall) in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Sp). Yeasts do not have sphingomyelin but instead have inositol phosphosphingolipids, which may function as orthologs of mammalian sphingomyelin. In this review, we will describe findings related to the function of ISC1, its localization, mechanisms, and its roles in cell response to different types of stresses. These studies serve as a foundation for the elucidation of the properties and functions of the extended family of nSMases.

11527975|t|Design and characterization of a highly selective peptide inhibitor of the small conductance calcium-activated K+ channel, SkCa2.
11527975|a|Apamin-sensitive small conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (SKCa1-3) mediate the slow afterhyperpolarization in neurons, but the molecular identity of the channel has not been defined because of the lack of specific inhibitors. Here we describe the structure-based design of a selective inhibitor of SKCa2. Leiurotoxin I (Lei) and PO5, peptide toxins that share the RXCQ motif, potently blocked human SKCa2 and SKCa3 but not SKCa1, whereas maurotoxin, Pi1, Tskappa, and PO1 were ineffective. Lei blocked these channels more potently than PO5 because of the presence of Ala(1), Phe(2), and Met(7). By replacing Met(7) in the RXCQ motif of Lei with the shorter, unnatural, positively charged diaminobutanoic acid (Dab), we generated Lei-Dab(7), a selective SKCa2 inhibitor (K(d) = 3.8 nm) that interacts with residues in the external vestibule of the channel. SKCa3 was rendered sensitive to Lei-Dab(7) by replacing His(521) with the corresponding SKCa2 residue (Asn(367)). Intracerebroventricular injection of Lei-Dab(7) into mice resulted in no gross central nervous system toxicity at concentrations that specifically blocked SKCa2 homotetramers. Lei-Dab(7) will be a useful tool to investigate the functional role of SKCa2 in mammalian tissues.

27170557|t|Berries and anthocyanins: promising functional food ingredients with postprandial glycaemia-lowering effects.
27170557|a|The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is predicted to reach unprecedented levels in the next few decades. In addition to excess body weight, there may be other overlapping dietary drivers of impaired glucose homeostasis that are associated with an obesogenic diet, such as regular exposure to postprandial spikes in blood glucose arising from diets dominated by highly refined starches and added sugars. Strategies to reduce postprandial hyperglycaemia by optimising the functionality of foods would strengthen efforts to reduce the risk of T2D. Berry bioactives, including anthocyanins, are recognised for their inhibitory effects on carbohydrate digestion and glucose absorption. Regular consumption of berries has been associated with a reduction in the risk of T2D. This review aims to examine the evidence from in vitro, animal and human studies, showing that berries and berry anthocyanins may act in the gut to modulate postprandial glycaemia. Specifically, berry extracts and anthocyanins inhibit the activities of pancreatic α-amylase and α-glucosidase in the gut lumen, and interact with intestinal sugar transporters, sodium-dependent glucose transporter 1 and GLUT2, to reduce the rate of glucose uptake into the circulation. Growing evidence from randomised controlled trials suggests that berry extracts, purées and nectars acutely inhibit postprandial glycaemia and insulinaemia following oral carbohydrate loads. Evidence to date presents a sound basis for exploring the potential for using berries/berry extracts as an additional stratagem to weight loss, adherence to dietary guidelines and increasing physical exercise, for the prevention of T2D.

17144670|t|Fungal heme oxygenases: Functional expression and characterization of Hmx1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and CaHmx1 from Candida albicans.
17144670|a|Heme oxygenases convert heme to free iron, CO, and biliverdin. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans express putative heme oxygenases that are required for the acquisition of iron from heme, a critical process for fungal survival and virulence. The putative heme oxygenases Hmx1 and CaHmx1 from S. cerevisiae and C. albicans, respectively, minus the sequences coding for C-terminal membrane-binding domains, have been expressed in Escherichia coli. The C-terminal His-tagged, truncated enzymes are obtained as soluble, active proteins. Purified ferric Hmx1 and CaHmx1 have Soret absorption maxima at 404 and 410 nm, respectively. The apparent heme binding Kd values for Hmx1 and CaHmx1 are 0.34 +/- 0.09 microM and 1.0 +/- 0.2 microM, respectively. The resonance Raman spectra of Hmx1 reveal a heme binding pocket similar to those of the mammalian and bacterial heme oxygenases. Several reductants, including ascorbate, yeast cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR), human CPR, spinach ferredoxin/ferredoxin reductase, and putidaredoxin/putidaredoxin reductase, are able to provide electrons for biliverdin production by Hmx1 and CaHmx1. Of these, ascorbate is the most effective reducing partner. Heme oxidation by Hmx1 and CaHmx1 regiospecifically produces biliverdin IXalpha. Spectroscopic analysis of aerobic reactions with H2O2 identifies verdoheme as a reaction intermediate. Hmx1 and CaHmx1 are the first fungal heme oxygenases to be heterologously overexpressed and characterized. Their heme degradation activity is consistent with a role in iron acquisition.

15028695|t|Restricted distribution of the butyrate kinase pathway among butyrate-producing bacteria from the human colon.
15028695|a|The final steps in butyrate synthesis by anaerobic bacteria can occur via butyrate kinase and phosphotransbutyrylase or via butyryl-coenzyme A (CoA):acetate CoA-transferase. Degenerate PCR and enzymatic assays were used to assess the presence of butyrate kinase among 38 anaerobic butyrate-producing bacterial isolates from human feces that represent three different clostridial clusters (IV, XIVa, and XVI). Only four strains were found to possess detectable butyrate kinase activity. These were also the only strains to give PCR products (verifiable by sequencing) with degenerate primer pairs designed within the butyrate kinase gene or between the linked butyrate kinase/phosphotransbutyrylase genes. Further analysis of the butyrate kinase/phosphotransbutyrylase genes of one isolate, L2-50, revealed similar organization to that described previously from different groups of clostridia, along with differences in flanking sequences and phylogenetic relationships. Butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase activity was detected in all 38 strains examined, suggesting that it, rather than butyrate kinase, provides the dominant route for butyrate formation in the human colonic ecosystem that contains a constantly high concentration of acetate.

11392609|t|The water-soluble components of the essential oil of Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree oil) suppress the production of superoxide by human monocytes, but not neutrophils, activated in vitro.
11392609|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the regulatory properties of the essential oil of Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree oil) on the production of oxygen derived reactive species by human peripheral blood leukocytes activated in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ability of tea tree oil to reduce superoxide production by neutrophils and monocytes stimulated with N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was examined. RESULTS: The water-soluble fraction of tea tree oil had no significant effect on agonist-stimulated superoxide production by neutrophils, but significantly and dose-dependently suppressed agonist-stimulated superoxide production by monocytes. This suppression was not due to cell death. Chemical analysis identified the water-soluble components to be terpinen-4-ol, alpha-terpineol and 1,8-cineole. When examined individually, terpinen-4-ol significantly suppressed fMLP- and LPS- but not PMA-stimulated superoxide production; alpha-terpineol significantly suppressed fMLP-, LPS- and PMA-stimulated superoxide production; 1,8-cineole was without effect. CONCLUSION: Tea tree oil components suppress the production of superoxide by monocytes, but not neutrophils, suggesting the potential for selective regulation of cell types by these components during inflammation.

3413036|t|Biosynthetic human growth hormone: subchronic toxicity studies in rats and monkeys.
3413036|a|Biosynthetic human growth hormone was injected subcutaneously in rats for 90 days and in cynomolgus monkeys for 30 days. The daily doses were 0.5, 3.3 and 25 IU kg-1 (rats) and 0.3 and 15 IU kg-1 (monkeys). The growth hormone was tolerated well in both rats and monkeys. No drug related deaths occurred and all animals appeared to be normal and also behaved normally throughout the dosing period. Increased body weight gain, increased food utilisation and increased organ weights were seen in the rats in the high and intermediate dose groups. The higher doses of human growth hormone (3.3 and 25 IU kg-1) caused a glandular hyperplasia of the mammary gland in male and female rats with evidence of secretory activity. In the female monkeys secretory activity was seen without any sign of mammary gland hyperplasia. Mucification of the vaginal epithelium and stress induced prostatitis was observed in the rats. Additional treatment related changes in the rats were an increased haematopoietic activity in the spleen and an increase in the amounts of calcium and phosphate excreted in urine. An increase in fasting plasma glucose levels was seen in the male monkeys on the high dose level. The changes observed during the treatment periods presumably represent exaggerated pharmacological effects of the growth hormone.

7592974|t|Compartmentalized production of ceramide at the cell surface.
7592974|a|Ceramide produced by the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin is an important cellular intermediate in hormone action. Here, we present evidence that interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) binding to normal human fibroblasts initiates a lipid messenger cascade that takes place in a sphingomyelin-rich plasma membrane domain with the characteristics of caveolae. Hormone binding first stimulated the appearance of diacylglycerol (DAG) in a caveolearich membrane fraction isolated from whole cells. This was immediately followed by the loss of a resident population of sphingomyelin from the fraction and the concomitant appearance of ceramide. The ceramide produced in response to IL-1 beta blocked platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated DNA synthesis. IL-1 beta stimulated the appearance of DAG in other fractions from the same cell, but this DAG was not coupled to ceramide production. This indicates that ceramide production is highly compartmentalized at the cell surface. Since caveolae are known to be involved in membrane internalization, they may be essential for the delivery of ceramide to a site of action within the cell.

8262936|t|Biochemical and functional properties of recombinant human sickle hemoglobin expressed in yeast.
8262936|a|Previous studies had indicated that recombinant and natural human sickle hemoglobin had similar chemical properties (Martin de Llano, J. J., Schneewind, O., Stetler, G., and Manning, J. M. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 918-922). In the present study, additional biochemical and physiological characterization of some primary through quaternary structural features of recombinant sickle hemoglobin are described. The molecular weight of the purified recombinant sickle hemoglobin was identical to natural sickle hemoglobin as determined by mass spectrometry, thus excluding extensive post-translational modification in the yeast system. Carboxypeptidases A and B together catalyzed the release of COOH-terminal amino acids at the same rate for recombinant and natural hemoglobin S, consistent with identity in their primary and secondary structures in this region of the molecule. The tryptic peptide maps of natural and recombinant hemoglobins were practically indistinguishable, indicating the same internal protein sequences for recombinant and natural hemoglobins. As a probe of the secondary structure of recombinant sickle Hb, the reactivity of the SH group of Cys-93(beta) was investigated for the glutathione sickle hemoglobin adduct, which has significant anti-gelling and anti-sickling properties. The position of glutathione at Cys-93(beta) was established by direct mass spectrometric analysis of enzyme digests; reduction of this derivative to the unmodified chains was also observed by mass spectrometry and by isoelectric focusing. The oxygen equilibrium curves of recombinant and natural sickle hemoglobin at high protein concentration were superimposable with identical Hill coefficients of 3.3. The response of recombinant sickle hemoglobin to chloride with respect to a lowered oxygen affinity was identical to that of natural sickle hemoglobin. The gelation properties of recombinant and natural sickle hemoglobins were identical at the high hemoglobin concentrations that occur in the red cell. Therefore, the yeast expression system synthesizes a completely functional recombinant sickle hemoglobin with the same biochemical and physiological properties as natural sickle hemoglobin with respect to features characteristic of its primary through quaternary structures.

25524706|t|Structural basis for misfolding in myocilin-associated glaucoma.
25524706|a|Olfactomedin (OLF) domain-containing proteins play roles in fundamental cellular processes and have been implicated in disorders ranging from glaucoma, cancers and inflammatory bowel disorder, to attention deficit disorder and childhood obesity. We solved crystal structures of the OLF domain of myocilin (myoc-OLF), the best studied such domain to date. Mutations in myoc-OLF are causative in the autosomal dominant inherited form of the prevalent ocular disorder glaucoma. The structures reveal a new addition to the small family of five-bladed β-propellers. Propellers are most well known for their ability to act as hubs for protein-protein interactions, a function that seems most likely for myoc-OLF, but they can also act as enzymes. A calcium ion, sodium ion and glycerol molecule were identified within a central hydrophilic cavity that is accessible via movements of surface loop residues. By mapping familial glaucoma-associated lesions onto the myoc-OLF structure, three regions sensitive to aggregation have been identified, with direct applicability to differentiating between neutral and disease-causing non-synonymous mutations documented in the human population worldwide. Evolutionary analysis mapped onto the myoc-OLF structure reveals conserved and divergent regions for possible overlapping and distinctive functional protein-protein or protein-ligand interactions across the broader OLF domain family. While deciphering the specific normal biological functions, ligands and binding partners for OLF domains will likely continue to be a challenging long-term experimental pursuit, atomic detail structural knowledge of myoc-OLF is a valuable guide for understanding the implications of glaucoma-associated mutations and will help focus future studies of this biomedically important domain family.

2082825|t|Oxygen requirements of yeasts.
2082825|a|Type species of 75 yeast genera were examined for their ability to grow anaerobically in complex and mineral media. To define anaerobic conditions, we added a redox indicator, resazurin, to the media to determine low redox potentials. All strains tested were capable of fermenting glucose to ethanol in oxygen-limited shake-flask cultures, even those of species generally regarded as nonfermentative. However, only 23% of the yeast species tested grew under anaerobic conditions. A comparative study with a number of selected strains revealed that Saccharomyces cerevisiae stands out as a yeast capable of rapid growth at low redox potentials. Other yeasts, such as Torulaspora delbrueckii and Candida tropicalis, grew poorly mu max, 0.03 and 0.05 h-1, respectively) under anaerobic conditions in mineral medium supplemented with Tween 80 and ergosterol. The latter organisms grew rapidly under oxygen limitation and then displayed a high rate of alcoholic fermentation. It can be concluded that these yeasts have hitherto-unidentified oxygen requirements for growth.

6777486|t|Magnesium buffering in intact human red blood cells measured using the ionophore A23187.
6777486|a|1. A method was developed for measuring the cytoplasmic magnesium buffering of intact red cells using the divalent cation selective ionophore A23187. Addition of A23187 to a suspension of red cells induces rapid equilibration of ionized magnesium across the cell membrane. 2. Entry of magnesium into red cells is associated with cell swelling and depolarization of the membrane potential. 3. At an external ionized magnesium concentration of about 0.15 mM corresponding to an internal ionized concentration of 0.4 mM the addition of A23187 did not produce a change in the magnesium content of the cells. This indicates that the normal ionized magnesium concentration inside the oxygenated red cell is about 0.4 mM. 4. The magnesium buffering curve for oxygenated, inosine-fed human red blood cells is adequately described by the existence of three buffer systems of increasing capacity and decreasing affinity. These are 0.15 mM with a Km < 10(-7) M, probably structural magnesium bound within the cell proteins; 1.6 mM with a Km approximately equal to 0.08 mM, mainly ATP and other nucleotides; and about 21-25 mM with a Km approximately equal to 3.6 mM, a major portion of this being organic phosphates. It is suggested that the contribution of 2,3-DPG to the low affinity site involves each phosphate group acting as an independent binding site for magnesium.

17457351|t|Mechanisms of disease: L-arginine in coronary atherosclerosis--a clinical perspective.
17457351|a|L-arginine is the substrate of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and the main precursor of nitric oxide in the vascular endothelium, thus its effects are mediated largely by increases in nitric oxide production. L-arginine has antioxidant and antiapoptotic properties, increases smooth muscle relaxation, inhibits the expression of adhesion molecules and chemotactic peptides, decreases endothelin-1 expression, and inhibits platelet aggregation. This amino acid also improves endothelial function in patients with coronary artery disease and dilates human epicardial atheromatous coronary arteries. Despite the positive results from small case-control studies, it is still unclear whether chronic administration of L-arginine has any effect on clinical outcome in patients with coronary artery disease. In addition, other indirect strategies, such as the inhibition of arginase, could prove more effective at improving intracellular L-arginine bioavailability than exogenous L-arginine administration. The potential clinical usefulness of L-arginine, therefore, needs further evaluation in large, prospective clinical trials. Here, we present a critique of the existing literature about the role of L-arginine in the prevention of atherosclerosis.

27375483|t|The Urotensin II System and Carotid Atherosclerosis: A Role in Vascular Calcification.
27375483|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The aims of the present study were to determine the expression of urotensin II (UII), urotensin-II related peptide (URP), and their receptor (UT) in stable and unstable carotid atherosclerosis, and determine the effects of UII on human aortic smooth muscle cell (SMCs) calcification. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined UII, URP, and UT protein expression in 88 carotid endarterectomy specimens using immunohistochemistry. Expression of UII, URP, and UT was more evident in unstable compared to stable plaques (P < 0.05). Multivariate Spearman correlation analyses revealed significant positive correlations between UII, URP and UT overall staining and presence of calcification, severity of stenosis and inflammation (P < 0.05). Subjects undergoing carotid endarterectomy had significantly higher plasma UII levels, as assessed by ELISA, when compared with normolipidemic healthy control subjects (P < 0.05). Incubation of human aortic SMCs cultured in phosphate media with varying concentrations of UII resulted in a significant increase in calcium deposition and alkaline phosphatase activity. UII also significantly increased β-catenin translocation and expression of ALPL, BMP2, ON, and SOX9 (P < 0.05). Incubation of cells with phosphate medium alone increased the expression of the pre-UT and mature UT (P < 0.01), and addition of UII had a synergistic effect on pre-UT protein expression (P < 0.001) compared to phosphate medium alone. CONCLUSIONS: Upregulation of UII, URP, and UT in unstable carotid endarterectomy plaques and plasma, and the stimulatory effect of UII on vascular smooth muscle cell calcification suggest that the UII system may play a role in the pathogenesis of vascular calcification and stability of atherosclerosis.

27375834|t|Molecular and Cellular Effects of Hydrogen Peroxide on Human Lung Cancer Cells: Potential Therapeutic Implications.
27375834|a|Lung cancer has a very high mortality-to-incidence ratio, representing one of the main causes of cancer mortality worldwide. Therefore, new treatment strategies are urgently needed. Several diseases including lung cancer have been associated with the action of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from which hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is one of the most studied. Despite the fact that H2O2 may have opposite effects on cell proliferation depending on the concentration and cell type, it triggers several antiproliferative responses. H2O2 produces both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA lesions, increases the expression of cell adhesion molecules, and increases p53 activity and other transcription factors orchestrating cancer cell death. In addition, H2O2 facilitates the endocytosis of oligonucleotides, affects membrane proteins, induces calcium release, and decreases cancer cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, the MAPK pathway and the expression of genes related to inflammation including interleukins, TNF-α, and NF-κB are also affected by H2O2. Herein, we will summarize the main effects of hydrogen peroxide on human lung cancer leading to suggesting it as a potential therapeutic tool to fight this disease. Because of the multimechanistic nature of this molecule, novel therapeutic approaches for lung cancer based on the use of H2O2 may help to decrease the mortality from this malignancy.

22155597|t|A novel rare variant in SCN1Bb linked to Brugada syndrome and SIDS by combined modulation of Na(v)1.5 and K(v)4.3 channel currents.
22155597|a|BACKGROUND: Cardiac sodium channel β-subunit mutations have been associated with several inherited cardiac arrhythmia syndromes. OBJECTIVE: To identify and characterize variations in SCN1Bb associated with Brugada syndrome (BrS) and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). METHODS: All known exons and intron borders of the BrS-susceptibility genes were amplified and sequenced in both directions. Wild type (WT) and mutant genes were expressed in TSA201 cells and studied using co-immunoprecipitation and whole-cell patch-clamp techniques. RESULTS: Patient 1 was a 44-year-old man with an ajmaline-induced type 1 ST-segment elevation in V1 and V2 supporting the diagnosis of BrS. Patient 2 was a 62-year-old woman displaying a coved-type BrS electrocardiogram who developed cardiac arrest during fever. Patient 3 was a 4-month-old female SIDS case. A R214Q variant was detected in exon 3A of SCN1Bb (Na(v)1B) in all three probands, but not in any other gene previously associated with BrS or SIDS. R214Q was identified in 4 of 807 ethnically-matched healthy controls (0.50%). Co-expression of SCN5A/WT + SCN1Bb/R214Q resulted in peak sodium channel current (I(Na)) 56.5% smaller compared to SCN5A/WT + SCN1Bb/WT (n = 11-12, P<0.05). Co-expression of KCND3/WT + SCN1Bb/R214Q induced a Kv4.3 current (transient outward potassium current, I(to)) 70.6% greater compared with KCND3/WT + SCN1Bb/WT (n = 10-11, P<0.01). Co-immunoprecipitation indicated structural association between Na(v)β1B and Na(v)1.5 and K(v)4.3. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that R214Q variation in SCN1Bb is a functional polymorphism that may serve as a modifier of the substrate responsible for BrS or SIDS phenotypes via a combined loss of function of sodium channel current and gain of function of transient outward potassium current.

9447235|t|Preferential mitochondrial DNA injury caused by glucose oxidase as a steady generator of hydrogen peroxide in human fibroblasts.
9447235|a|To test the hypothesis that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is more prone to reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage than nuclear DNA, a continuous flux of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was produced with the glucose/glucose oxidase system. Using a horse radish peroxidase (HRPO)-based colorimetric assay to detect H2O2, glucose oxidase (GO; 12 mU/ml) produced 95 microM of H2O2 in 1 h, whereas only 46 microM of hydrogen peroxide accumulated in the presence of SV40-transformed human fibroblasts ( approximately 1 x 10(6). DNA damage was assessed in the mitochondira and three nuclear regions using a quantitative PCR assay. GO (12 mU/ml) resulted in more damage to the mitochondrial DNA (2.250 +/- 0.045 lesions/10 kb) than in any one of three nuclear targets, which included the non-expressed beta-globin locus (0.436 +/- 0.029 lesions/10 kb); and the active DNA polymerase b gene (0.442 +/- 0.037 lesions/10 kb); and the active hprt gene (0.310 +/- 0.025). Damage to the mtDNA occurred within 15 min of GO treatment, whereas nuclear damage did not appear until after 30 min, and reached a maximum after 60 min. Repair of mitochondrial damage after a 15 min GO (6 mU/ml) treatment was examined. Mitochondria repaired 50% of the damage after 1 h, and by 6 h all the damage was repaired. Higher doses of GO-generated H202, or more extended treatment periods, lead to mitochondrial DNA damage which was not repaired. Mitochondrial function was monitored using the MTT (3,(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. A 15 min treatment with 6 mU/ml of GO decreased mitochondrial activity to 80% of the control; the activity recovered completely within 1 h after damage. These data show that GO-generated H202 causes acute damage to mtDNA and function, and demonstrate that this organelle is an important site for the cellular toxicity of ROS.

22079896|t|Sugar inhibits the production of the toxins that trigger clostridial gas gangrene.
22079896|a|Histotoxic strains of Clostridium perfringens cause human gas gangrene, a devastating infection during which potent tissue-degrading toxins are produced and secreted. Although this pathogen only grows in anaerobic-nutrient-rich habitats such as deep wounds, very little is known regarding how nutritional signals influence gas gangrene-related toxin production. We hypothesize that sugars, which have been used throughout history to prevent wound infection, may represent a nutritional signal against gas gangrene development. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, that sugars (sucrose, glucose) inhibited the production of the main protein toxins, PLC (alpha-toxin) and PFO (theta-toxin), responsible for the onset and progression of gas gangrene. Transcription analysis experiments using plc-gusA and pfoA-gusA reporter fusions as well as RT-PCR analysis of mRNA transcripts confirmed that sugar represses plc and pfoA expression. In contrast an isogenic C. perfringens strain that is defective in CcpA, the master transcription factor involved in carbon catabolite response, was completely resistant to the sugar-mediated inhibition of PLC and PFO toxin production. Furthermore, the production of PLC and PFO toxins in the ccpA mutant strain was several-fold higher than the toxin production found in the wild type strain. Therefore, CcpA is the primary or unique regulatory protein responsible for the carbon catabolite (sugar) repression of toxin production of this pathogen. The present results are analyzed in the context of the role of CcpA for the development and aggressiveness of clostridial gas gangrene and the well-known, although poorly understood, anti-infective and wound healing effects of sugars and related substances.

10476683|t|Targeted expression of human CuZn superoxide dismutase gene in mouse central nervous system.
10476683|a|Copper zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) is an important enzyme for the detoxification of reactive oxygen species. Particularly in the central nervous system (CNS), reactive oxygen species are often associated with acute brain injuries and chronic neurodegeneration. It has been demonstrated in vivo that there is an inverse correlation between CuZnSOD activity and neuronal death after acute brain injury. To further understand the protective role of CuZnSOD upon neurons, we have generated transgenic mouse lines with targeted expression of the human CuZnSOD gene (SOD1) that is driven by a rat neuron-specific enolase gene promoter in neurons of the CNS. The transgenic SOD1 expression was restricted to the CNS identified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and SOD gel electrophoresis assays. The CuZnSOD activity was significantly increased in the brain stem of the transgenic mice. Immunostaining of human CuZnSOD activity showed that Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex were the most intensely stained neurons in the CNS of the transgenic mice.

7353357|t|An evaluation of the clinical potential of a comprehensive model of human respiration in artificially ventilated patients.
7353357|a|1. We have investigated the feasibility of accurately simulating the respiratory function of artificially ventilated patients, using a computer model of the respiratory system. Twelve patients artificially ventilated after uncomplicated cardiac bypass surgery was studied. 2. The basic information required to simulate individual ventilated subjects was measured or derived. A program was written to enable key model parameters to be adjusted automatically to match model predictions to these clinical measurements. On completion of this matching procedure all the variables computed by the model were compared with patient values (measured or derived) and their accuracy was assessed. 3. The matching algorithm successfully optimized parameters of the model representing metabolic activity, tissue respiratory quotient, venous admixture, physiological dead space and total body bicarbonate to match measured values for oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, Pa, O2, PaCO2, and arterial HCO3- respectively. Other variables compared arise from the solution of equations within the model and correlation between model and patient values is generally good (r greater than 0.9). However, values of Pv-, O2 correlate less well (r = 0.85). Factors affecting the accuracy of patient simulation are discussed and some deficiencies analysed. 4. The creation of an accurate, steady-state representation of a patient by the model opens up the possibility of using it interactively as an aid to clinical management. Some possible future developments of the technique are discussed.

7842726|t|The effect of raised inspired carbon dioxide on developing rat retinal vasculature exposed to elevated oxygen.
7842726|a|Hyperoxia is a risk factor for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), a blinding disease in infants. However, ROP develops in human infants without raised arterial oxygen levels, such as in cyanotic congenital heart disease. In these infants raised pCO2 may be a risk factor. We investigated the effect of inspired CO2 on oxygen induced retinopathy in the rat. 56 newborn Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to high cyclical O2 for seven days. In a control group, 27 rats were exposed to negligible CO2 by the use of soda lime. In the high CO2 group, 29 rats were exposed to elevated CO2 by omitting soda lime from their chambers. Rats in both groups had a recovery period of three days in room air following cyclical O2 exposure. On the eleventh day all rats were sacrificed after intracardiac injections of fluorescein under deep anesthesia and the retinae were dissected and flat mounted for fluorescent microscopy. The ratio of vascularized:total retinal area was calculated using computer assisted image analysis. In the high CO2 group 62% +/- 7% SD of the retina was vascularized vs. 81% +/- 7% in low CO2 group (p < 0.001). Elevated inspired CO2 results in pronounced retardation of retinal vascular development in neonatal rats exposed to fluctuating raised oxygen.

8292972|t|Leukocyte inhibitory factor (LIF) potentiates human macrophage aggregation and activation responses to calcium ionophore A23187 and directly induces leukotriene B4 and thromboxane A2 release.
8292972|a|Aggregation studies have become a useful criterion for analyzing leukocyte motility and activation in vitro. The T-cell-derived lymphokine human leukocyte inhibitory factor (LIF) is a modulator of many important polymorphonuclear (PMN) functions in addition to aggregation such as chemotaxis, lysosomal degranulation, phagocytosis, bactericidal killing, augmented antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), induction of neutrophil Fc-gamma, complement type-1 and FMLP receptors, and production of superoxide and H2O2. Our investigations focused on the ability of LIF to modulate the aggregation of macrophages (MO) induced by calcium ionophore A23187. The ionophore A23187 directly induced potent aggregation of macrophages, which was markedly enhanced when the cells were pretreated with LIF. However, the addition of LIF in the absence of other costimuli did not directly induce MO aggregation. LIF was shown to enhance PMN aggregation induced by N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (FMLP), but did not augment the aggregation of FMLP-stimulated macrophages, indicating a cellular specificity of aggregation-inducing costimuli following LIF priming. Additional cytokines examined for possibly inducing MO aggregation were interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), and interleukin-6 (IL-6); all proved to be incapable of inducing aggregation directly, nor did they enhance the effect of A23187 ionophore on macrophage aggregation. Additionally, we found that LIF can directly stimulate MO to activate specific pathways of the arachidonic acid cascade, inducing the synthesis and release of thromboxanes and leukotriene B4. LIF did not augment the potent ability of A23187 to induce increased production of LTB4 or TxA2 by human MO. These new results coupled with our previously published data indicate that LIF can enhance the activation of both MO and PMN leukocytes when exposed to either A23187 or FMLP, respectively. Moreover, these data suggest that LIF can contribute directly to monocyte-macrophage leukocyte activation, in addition to PMN activation, during inflammatory responses, resulting in greater cell aggregation, activation, and specific proinflammatory arachidonic acid product release.

25114439|t|Recurrent posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome of the brainstem in a hypertensive patient with end-stage renal disease.
25114439|a|A 59-year-old man with end-stage renal disease was brought to our emergency department with complaints of headache, nausea, dysarthria, tic, and weakness involving the bilateral arms and legs. He had the similar episode 4 month before, when he was treated elsewhere. The patient had received hemodialysis three times per week. His medications included for hypertension. On examination at his arrival, he was alert with reduced concentration and incoherent thoughts. The blood pressure was 181/87 mmHg and other vital signs were normal. Neurological findings showed slight dysarthria and slow movements but no other abnormalities. Laboratory data showed increased serum creatinine and potassium presumably for a session of periodical hemodialysis but normal sodium concentration. His cerebrospinal fluid examination was normal. We treated him by hemodialysis. Diagnosis of PRES was most likely because of the clinical features and the MRI findings. His symptoms had disappeared immediately and completely after we controlled high blood pressure. MRI on 13 days after admission showed the improvement of the abnormal findings. Although the pathophysiology of PRES is incompletely understood, renal failure was known as one of the risk factors. A relative lack of sympathetic innervation of posterior circulation could not protect the area when severe hypertension makes auto-regulatory control collapsed. However, PRES of the brainstem is uncommon although the posterior circulation involves it. Because control of his hypertension was not appropriate in the outpatient settings before this event, it could have contributed to the recurrence in this patient.

15001801|t|Physiological hypertrophy of the FHL muscle following 8 weeks of progressive resistance exercise in the rat.
15001801|a|In humans, progressive resistance exercise is recognized for its ability to induce skeletal muscle hypertrophy. In an attempt to develop an animal model which mimics human progressive resistance exercise, Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to climb a 1.1-m vertical (80 degree incline) ladder with weights secured to their tail. The rats were trained once every 3 days for 8 weeks. Each training session consisted of 4-9 (6.02 +/- 0.23) climbs requiring 8-12 dynamic movements per climb. Based on performance, the weight carried during each session was progressively increased. Over the course of 8 weeks, the maximal amount of weight the rats could carry increased 287%, p </= 0.001. The improved training performance was associated with a 23% absolute increase in the weight of the flexor hallucis longus (FHL), with a concomitant 24% increase in both total and myofibrillar protein, p</= 0.001. Peak tetanic tension (Po) of the FHL increased 20%, p </= 0.001, while specific tetanic tension (SPo) was not altered. No change in twitch tension (Pt) was observed, which resulted in a 22% decrease in specific twitch tension (SPt) p </= 0.01. Despite a decrease in resistance to fatigue, p </= 0.05, myosin heavy chain composition, ATP, ADP, creatine, and creatine phosphate concentrations of the FHL were not altered. The results of this study describe an animal model that mimics many of the training parameters and physiological adaptations observed with human progressive resistance exercise.

14527616|t|Dynamics of cognitive processing in the human hippocampus by neuromagnetic and neurochemical assessments.
14527616|a|Various features of cognitive processing have been studied using event-related electric potentials and magnetoencephalography (MEG), as well as neuroimaging. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a unique, noninvasive approach of measuring cellular metabolism that reflects the static metabolic state. The present study is the first to show noninvasively the dynamic neurophysiological and metabolic changes that occur during cognitive processing in vivo in the human hippocampus, as measured by MEG and spin-echo dynamic (1)H-MRS time-locked to the onset of the stimulus. The stimuli consisted of unpleasant and pleasant pictures of faces of human or primate babies. The event-related synchronization of theta activity and levels of creatine/phosphocreatine and choline-containing compounds relative to the respective level in the resting condition increased significantly, more in the right hippocampus than in the left, during the target discrimination task and also more in the right hippocampus in response to the unpleasant target picture than the pleasant one. These results suggest that excitatory postsynaptic metabolism in the hippocampus, especially in the right hippocampus, is involved in discriminative and cognitive processing of emotional information. This newly devised method combining event-related MEG with MRS can be used to noninvasively elucidate the dynamic features of neurophysiology and neurochemical metabolism and represents a promising approach toward improving our understanding of brain pathophysiology.

27194473|t|Regulation of membrane KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel density by sphingomyelin synthase 1.
27194473|a|Sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylcholine and ceramide to sphingomyelin and diacylglycerol. We previously showed that SMS1 deficiency leads to a reduction in expression of the K(+) channel KCNQ1 in the inner ear (Lu MH, Takemoto M, Watanabe K, Luo H, Nishimura M, Yano M, Tomimoto H, Okazaki T, Oike Y, and Song WJ. J Physiol 590: 4029-4044, 2012), causing hearing loss. However, it remains unknown whether this change in expression is attributable to a cellular process or a systemic effect in the knockout animal. Here, we examined whether manipulation of SMS1 activity affects KCNQ1/KCNE1 currents in individual cells. To this end, we expressed the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel in human embryonic kidney 293T cells and evaluated the effect of SMS1 manipulations on the channel using whole cell recording. Application of tricyclodecan-9-yl-xanthogenate, a nonspecific inhibitor of SMSs, significantly reduced current density and altered channel voltage dependence. Knockdown of SMS1 by a short hairpin RNA, however, reduced current density alone. Consistent with this, overexpression of SMS1 increased the current density without changing channel properties. Furthermore, application of protein kinase D inhibitors also suppressed current density without changing channel properties; this effect was nonadditive with that of SMS1 short hairpin RNA. These results suggest that SMS1 positively regulates KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel density in a protein kinase D-dependent manner.

2345562|t|Enhancement of K+ conductance improves in vitro the contraction force of skeletal muscle in hypokalemic periodic paralysis.
2345562|a|An abnormal ratio between Na+ and K+ conductances seems to be the cause for the depolarization and paralysis of skeletal muscle in primary hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Recently we have shown that the "K+ channel opener" cromakalim hyperpolarizes mammalian skeletal muscle fibers. Now we have studied the effects of this drug on the twitch force of muscle biopsies from normal and diseased human skeletal muscle. Cromakalim had little effect on the twitch force of normal muscle whereas it strongly improved the contraction force of fibers from patients suffering from hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Recordings of intracellular K+ and Cl- activities in human muscle and isolated rat soleus muscle support the view that cromakalim enhances the membrane K+ conductance (gK+). These data indicate that "K+ channel openers" may have a beneficial effect in primary hypokalemic periodic paralysis.

12575983|t|The platelet-endothelium interaction mediated by lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 reduces the intracellular concentration of nitric oxide in endothelial cells.
12575983|a|OBJECTIVES: To address the potential role of the endothelial lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) in the thrombotic system, in this study we first examined whether platelet interaction with LOX-1 generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide (O2.-) and then investigated the relationship between the intracellular production of O2.- and the availability of nitric oxide (NO). BACKGROUND: Oxidative inactivation of NO is regarded as an important cause of its decreased biologic activity which may favor platelet-dependent arterial thrombosis. METHODS: Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) and Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells stably expressing bovine LOX-1 (BLOX-1-CHO) were incubated at different times with human platelets. The ROS, O2.-, and NO were measured in cells by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The incubation of BAECs and BLOX-1-CHO cells with human platelets induced a sharp and dose-dependent increase in intracellular concentration of ROS and O2.- (p from <0.01 to <0.001). The increase in intracellular concentration of O2.- was followed by a dose-dependent reduction in basal and bradykinin-induced intracellular NO concentration (p from <0.01 to <0.001). The increase in O2.- and the reduction of NO were inhibited by the presence of vitamin C and anti-LOX-1 monoclonal antibody (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that one of the pathophysiologic consequences of platelet binding to LOX-1 may be the inactivation of NO through an increased cellular production of O2.-.

9135054|t|An AP-2 binding sequence within exon 1 of human and porcine choline acetyltransferase genes enhances transcription in neural cells.
9135054|a|The gene for choline acetyltransferase, synthesizing acetylcholine, is induced by several neurotrophic factors. A role for AP-2 in enhancing this transcription and limiting it to neural cells is strongly suggested. Previous studies demonstrated that base pairs +465-727 within the untranslated exon 1 of the porcine gene enhanced the expression of a reporter gene transfected into PC-12 cells. Deletion and mutation experiments indicate that base pairs +465-472 (CCGCGGGG) in the porcine gene, or +307-314 (CCTCGGGG) in the human sequence, were necessary and sufficient for increased gene expression in cholinergic or adrenergic but not liver cells. Constructs containing active sequences, but not inactive mutated sequences, specifically bind nuclear proteins from neuroblastoma cells, but not liver cells, in gel shift experiments. The human and porcine sequences are in agreement with an AP-2 consensus binding sequence, a nuclear transcription factor expressed only in cells derived from the neural crest. Gel shift experiments using recombinant AP-2 confirm this identification. AP-2 antibody further retarded the mobility of these DNA-nuclear extract or DNA-AP-2 complexes. These results support the importance of this AP-2 binding sequence in enhancing and limiting choline acetyltransferase expression in neural cells.

15329058|t|Functional characterization of muscarinic receptor subtypes in human duodenal secretion.
15329058|a|AIM: Acetylcholine (ACh) stimulates ion secretion in the small intestine and colon. The purpose of the present study was to characterize the ACh-induced electrogenic ion transport in human duodenum and determine the muscarinic receptor subtypes functionally involved. METHODS: Biopsies from the second part of duodenum were obtained from 28 patients during endoscopy. Biopsies were mounted in modified Ussing chambers with air-suction for measurements of short-circuit current by a previously validated technique. Short-circuit current was measured after application of chloride/bicarbonate transport inhibitors bumetanide, 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (SITS), diphenylamine-2-carboxylate (DPC), and acetazolamide. 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP) and two mamba toxins MT3 and MT7 were used to characterize the mAChR receptor subtypes involved. The effects of transport inhibitors and receptor antagonists were measured by comparing two consecutive responses of ACh on short-circuit current in the same biopsy specimen. RESULTS: Bumetanide and 4-DAMP significantly inhibited ACh-induced short-circuit current, whereas SITS, DPC, acetazolamide, mamba toxin MT3, and mamba toxin MT7 all failed to show any significant effect. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our results indicate that muscarinic receptor subtype M3 acts as the main mediator of bumetanide-sensitive ACh-induced secretion in human duodenum.

11019721|t|Alveolar epithelial barrier. Role in lung fluid balance in clinical lung injury.
11019721|a|Several studies have established that transport of sodium from the air spaces to the lung interstitium is a primary mechanism driving alveolar fluid clearance, although further work is needed to determine the role of chloride in vectorial fluid transport across the alveolar epithelium. Although there are significant differences among species in the basal rates of sodium and fluid transport, the basic mechanism seems to depend on sodium uptake by channels on the apical membrane of alveolar type II cells, followed by extrusion of sodium on the basolateral surface by Na,K-ATPase. This process can be upregulated by several catecholamine-dependent and independent mechanisms. The identification of water channels expressed in lung, together with the high water permeabilities, suggest a potential role for channel-mediated water movement between the air space and capillary compartments, although definitive evidence will depend on the results of transgenic mouse knock-out studies. The application of this new knowledge regarding salt and water transport in alveolar epithelium in relation to pathologic conditions has been successful in clinically relevant experimental studies, as well as in a few clinical studies. The studies of exogenous and endogenous catecholamine regulation of alveolar fluid clearance are a good example of how new insights into the basic mechanisms of alveolar sodium and fluid transport can be translated to clinically relevant experimental studies. Exogenous catecholamines can increase the rate of alveolar fluid clearance in several species, including the human lung, and it is also apparent that release of endogenous catecholamines can upregulate alveolar fluid clearance in animals with septic or hypovolemic shock. It is possible that therapy with beta-adrenergic agonists might be useful to accelerate the resolution of alveolar edema in some patients. In some patients, the extent of injury to the alveolar epithelial barrier may be too severe for beta-adrenergic agonists to enhance the resolution of alveolar edema, although some experimental studies indicate that alveolar fluid clearance can be augmented in the presence of moderately severe lung injury. A longer-term upregulation of alveolar epithelial fluid transport might be achieved by strategies that accelerate the proliferation of alveolar type II cells repopulating the injured epithelium in clinical lung injury. More clinical research is needed to evaluate the strategies that can upregulate alveolar epithelial fluid transport with both short-term therapy (i.e., beta-agonists) and more sustained, longer-term effects of epithelial mitogens such as keratinocyte growth factor. These approaches may be useful in reducing mortality in the acute respiratory distress syndrome.

1333498|t|Direct measurement of myocardial free radical generation in an in vivo model: effects of postischemic reperfusion and treatment with human recombinant superoxide dismutase.
1333498|a|OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine whether postischemic reperfusion of the heart in living rabbits induces a burst of oxygen free radical generation that can be attenuated by recombinant human superoxide dismutase administered at the moment of reflow. BACKGROUND: This phenomenon was previously demonstrated in crystalloid perfused, globally ischemic rabbit hearts. METHODS: Thirty-two open chest rabbits were assigned to one of four groups of eight animals each: Group I (control animals), no coronary artery occlusion; Group II, 30 min of circumflex marginal coronary artery occlusion without reperfusion; Group III, 30 min of coronary occlusion followed by 60 s of reperfusion, and Group IV, 30 min of coronary occlusion followed by treatment with recombinant human superoxide dismutase (a 20-mg/kg body weight bolus 90 s before reperfusion and a 0.17-mg/kg infusion during 60 s of reperfusion). Full thickness biopsy specimens taken from the ischemic region were then rapidly freeze clamped and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed at 77 degrees K. RESULTS: Three radical signals similar to those previously identified in the isolated, crystalloid perfused rabbit heart were observed: an isotropic signal with g = 2.004 suggestive of a semiquinone, an anisotropic signal with g parallel = 2.033 and g perpendicular = 2.005 suggestive of an oxygen-centered alkyl peroxy radical, and a triplet with g = 2.000 and aN = 24 G suggestive of a nitrogen-centered radical. In addition, a fourth signal consistent with an iron-sulfur center was seen. The oxygen-centered free radical concentration during normal perfusion (Group I) was 1.8 +/- 0.8 mumol compared with 4.4 +/- 0.9 mumol after 30 min of regional ischemia without reperfusion (Group II) and 13.0 +/- 2.5 mumol after 60 s of reperfusion (Group III) (p < 0.05 among all three groups). In contrast, superoxide dismutase treated-rabbits (Group IV) demonstrated a peak oxygen radical concentration of only 5.9 +/- 1.2 mumol (p < 0.05 vs. Group III). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that reperfusion after regional myocardial ischemia in the intact rabbit is associated with a burst of oxygen-centered free radicals. The magnitude of this burst is greater than that seen after a comparable duration of global ischemia in the isolated, buffer-perfused rabbit heart preparation and is significantly reduced by superoxide dismutase administration begun just before reflow.

9301393|t|Effect of halothane on K+ and carbachol stimulated [3H]noradrenaline release and increased [Ca2+]i in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells.
9301393|a|We have examined the effects of the volatile general anaesthetic agent, halothane, on K+ and carbachol stimulated [3H]noradrenaline release and associated increases in intracellular Ca2+ in a cultured human neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y. K+ (but not carbachol) stimulated [3H]noradrenaline release, and the increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration was entirely extracellular Ca2+ dependent. Halothane produced a dose-dependent reduction in K+ evoked release of [3H]noradrenaline with significant inhibition (17%) occurring from 1.26 atm%. Basal and carbachol evoked release were unaffected. Halothane also produced a dose-dependent reduction in K+ evoked increases (measured at the peak) in intracellular Ca2+ with significant inhibition (29%) occurring from 0.88 atm%. K+ plateau, basal and carbachol evoked increases in intracellular Ca2+ were unaffected. These data suggest that halothane reduced Ca2+ entry through voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels and implicate this important class of ion channel in the mechanism of anaesthesia.

8678295|t|Quantification of 5-fluorouracil incorporation into RNA of human and murine tumors as measured with a sensitive gas chromatography-mass spectrometry assay.
8678295|a|5-Fluorouracil (5FU) can exert its cytotoxic activity by either inhibition of thymidylate synthase or incorporation into RNA. The extent and importance of the latter in tumors of patients are not clear, due to the lack of sensitive and reproducible methods. RNA from 5FU-treated human WiDr colon tumor cells was isolated and [(14)CL]5FU incorporation into RNA was measured by traditional scintillation counting while that of nonradiolabeled 5FU was measured with the present, new method. For the latter purpose, isolated RNA was incubated with RNase, alkaline phosphatase, and uridine phosphorylase, resulting in a complete degradation of RNA, nucleotides, and nucleoside to 5FU. 5FU was then measured with gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. For both methods RNA incorporation was 0.4 pmol/h/micrograms RNA at 25 microM 5FU while a similar time (up to 4 h) and concentration dependence (25 to 50 microM) were found. Reproducibility of the assay was more than 95%. In a murine colon tumor 5FU incorporation into RNA reached a peak of 10 pmol/micron RNA at 2 h after administration of the the maximum tolerated dose of 80 mg5FU/kg, which was retained until at least 72 h at 2.5 pmol/micron. In tumors from patients treated with 500 mg5FU/m(2) incorporation into RNA after 24 h amounted to 1.0-1.5 pmol/micrograms RNA. In conclusion, a novel approach, combining different sensitive and reproducible techniques, was established to measure 5FU incorporation into RNA in clinical tumor specimens enabling determination of its clinical relevance.

28263535|t|Exposure of rats to exogenous endocrine disruptors 17alpha-ethinylestradiol and benzo(a)pyrene and an estrogenic hormone estradiol induces expression of cytochromes P450 involved in their metabolism.
28263535|a|OBJECTIVES: The term "endocrine disruptor" (ED) is used for compounds that mimic or antagonize the effects of endogenous hormones. Synthetic estrogen 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and a human carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) are assigned as exogenous endocrine disruptors and an estrogenic hormone estradiol is a natural endogenous disruptor. Here, the potency of these three disruptors administered to rats individually and in combination to induce expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes involved in their own metabolism (CYP1A1, 2C and 3A) in vivo was investigated. METHODS: Changes in CYP protein expression after exposure of rats to BaP, EE2 or estradiol were analyzed by Western blotting. Using the HPLC method, CYP1A1, 2C and 3A specific activities in hepatic microsomes isolated from exposed rats were analyzed. RESULTS: Whereas exposure to BaP induces expression of CYP1A1 protein and its marker activity (Sudan I oxidation) in liver, kidney and lung of rats, no significant induction of this CYP and its enzyme activity was produced by EE2 and estradiol. Treatment of BaP in combination with EE2 and/or estradiol decreased the BaP-mediated CYP1A1 induction in liver of exposed rats. BaP also induces CYP2C11 protein in rat liver and kidney, but does not increase its enzyme activity measured as testosterone 16α-hydroxylation. The enzyme activity of another enzyme of the 2C subfamily, CYP2C6, diclofenac 4'-hydroxylation, is even decreased by BaP. The CYP2C11 protein expression and/or its activity are also increased in liver of rats treated with EE2 and estradiol, but its expression is significantly decreased in lung. The CYP2C6 activity is also elevated by treatment of rats with EE2 and estradiol administered individually as well as in their combination. Whereas only a slight increase in CYP3A protein expression was found by BaP in rat liver, its enzyme activity, testosterone 6β-hydroxyalation, increased significantly in this organ. In contrast, no effect or even a decrease in CYP3A expression and its enzyme activity was produced by EE2 and estradiol in rats exposed to these compounds.

19517521|t|Asymmetric division of Hansenula polymorpha reflected by a drop of light scatter intensity measured in batch microtiter plate cultivations at phosphate limitation.
19517521|a|Hansenula polymorpha RB11 pC10-FMD (P(FMD)- GFP) (FMD promoter gfp gene) was simultaneously cultivated in the Respiration Activity Monitoring System (RAMOS) and in the microtiter plate cultivation system "BioLector" under phosphate limitation. The light scatter signal of the BioLector, for the determination of the biomass concentration in the wells, shows a significant decrease with the onset of the phosphate limitation until a stationary level is reached. At lower initial phosphate concentration this effect is more pronounced and longer time is required until the stationary level of the scattered light is achieved. The oxygen transfer rate signal of the RAMOS and the light scatter signal of the BioLector correlate with respect to the points of time where the maxima and the stationary levels of the courses are reached. In order to understand the effect causing this light scatter behavior, the forward and side scatter properties were investigated off line by flow cytometry. The decay in the light scatter of the BioLector seems to correlate with the formation of two subpopulations of different scatter intensities detected by a flow cytometer. With ongoing cultivation the fraction of cells possessing higher light scattering properties decreases until only a population of lower light scattering properties exists. The rate of transition of the yeast from one subpopulation to the other appears to be correlated with the rate of decrease in the BioLector light scatter signal. The formation of the subpopulations may be caused by an increased asymmetry in the cell cycle due to phosphate limitation.

7828221|t|Effects of N,N'-bisdimethyl-1,2-ethanediamine dichloride, a double-chain surfactant, on membrane-related functions in human erythrocytes.
7828221|a|The effects of N,N'-bisdimethyl-1,2-ethanediamine dichloride (dioctyldiQAS), a double chain surfactant with two positive charges in the polar head, on the erythrocyte membrane were studied. At sublytic concentrations dioctyldiQAS protected erythrocytes against hypotonic hemolysis, induced the formation of sphero-echinocytes, increased passive fluxes of potassium through the membrane, decreased the activity of the Na(+)-K(+)-pump and decreased the efflux of phosphate. The alterations in membrane-connected functions induced by dioctyldiQAS are qualitatively similar to those induced by its single-chain close analogue decyltrimethylammonium bromide. DioctyldiQAS, however, exhibited these effects at considerably lower concentrations than decyltrimethylammonium bromide. This is most likely due to a higher extent of partitioning into the membrane by dioctyldiQAS.

2902153|t|Alterations in phosphate metabolism during cellular recovery of radiation damage in yeast.
2902153|a|We have examined alterations in phosphate pools during cellular recovery from radiation damage in intact, wild-type diploid yeast cells using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Concurrent cell survival analysis was determined following exposure to 60Co gamma-radiation. Cells held in citrate-buffered saline (CBS) showed increased survival with increasing time after irradiation (liquid holding recovery, LHR) with no further recovery beyond 48 h. Addition of 100 mmol dm-3 glucose to the recovery medium resulted in greater recovery. In the presence of 5 mmol dm-3 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), LHR was completely inhibited. NMR analyses were done on cells perfused in agarose threads and maintained under conditions similar to those in the survival studies. ATP was observable by NMR only when glucose was present in the recovery medium. In control cells, ATP concentrations increased and plateaued with increasing recovery time. With increasing radiation dose the increase in ATP was of lesser magnitude, and after 2000 Gy no increase was observed. These observations suggest that either the production of ATP in irradiated cells is suppressed or there is enhanced ATP utilization for repair of radiation damage. In CBS with 100 mmol dm-3 glucose, a dose-dependent decrease in polyphosphate (polyP) was detectable with no concurrent increase in inorganic phosphate (Pi). In the absence of an external energy source, such as glucose, there was a slight increase in Pi. This suggests that polyP may be used as an alternative energy supply. When 2-DG was present in the recovery medium, polyP decreased, but there was a simultaneous increase in Pi with increasing radiation dose and recovery time. This suggests that the polyP are hydrolyzed as a source of phosphates for repair of radiation damage.

7788851|t|Cells transfected with transferrin receptor cDNA lacking the iron regulatory domain become more sensitive to the DNA-damaging action of oxidative stress.
7788851|a|Chinese hamster V79 cells were transfected with human transferrin receptor cDNA, lacking the 3' untranslatable regulatory sequence. One of the clones obtained was investigated completely. It exhibited the cDNA sequences recombined into the genome, transcribed the corresponding mRNA and became partially constitutive in iron uptake from transferrin. The rate of iron uptake was significantly higher in these cells than in the parental ones, as was the intracellular iron content, assessed indirectly by measuring the activation of the regulatory protein responsible for iron homeostasis control. The transfected cells were more sensitive to the DNA-damaging action of H2O2. This corroborates the important role that iron plays as a mediator of DNA damage by reactive oxygen species. It also points to the possibility that mutations at the regulatory sequences of transferrin receptors, leading to partial disturbance in iron homeostasis, might render the cells more prone to further mutations and malignant transformations by reactive oxygen species.

23192437|t|Polyphenols suppress hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress in human bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells.
23192437|a|Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are considered a highly promising candidate cell type for cell-based tissue engineering and regeneration because of their self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation characteristics. Increased levels of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) are associated with tissue injury and inflammation, impact a number of cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation, and have been linked to cellular senescence in MSCs, potentially compromising their activities. Naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds (polyphenols), epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), and curcumin, block ROS/RNS and are potent inflammation-modulating agents. However, their potential protective effects against oxidative stress in hMSCs have not been examined. In this study, we carried out a systematic analysis of the effects of polyphenols on hMSCs in their response to oxidative stress in the form of treatment with H(2)O(2) and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), respectively. Parameters measured included colony forming activity, apoptosis, and the levels of antioxidant enzymes and free reactive species. We found that polyphenols reversed H(2)O(2) -induced loss of colony forming activity in hMSCs. In a dose-dependent manner, polyphenols inhibited increased levels of ROS and NO, produced by H(2)O(2) or SNAP, respectively, in MSCs. Notably, polyphenols rapidly and almost completely blocked H(2)O(2) -induced ROS in the absence of significant direct effect on H(2)O(2) itself. Polyphenols also protected the antioxidant enzymes and reduced apoptotic cell death caused by H(2)O(2) exposure. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that EGCG and curcumin are capable of suppressing inducible oxidative stress in hMSCs, and suggest a possible new approach to maintain MSC viability and potency for clinical application.

9305465|t|A perspective on acetaldehyde concentrations and toxicity in man and animals.
9305465|a|Acetaldehyde (AcH) at a concentration of 593 mM lowers the natural fluorescence of commercial human serum by 12%. It also lowers the fluorescence of a beta-naphthylamine standard curve (recovery) in serum by 17%. These results contrast with earlier reports showing that 447 mM AcH had no effect upon fluorescence of serum or a beta-naphthylamine standard curve in serum. Because 447 mM AcH and 593 mM AcH represent 2.5% and 3.3% AcH, it is apparent that there is a narrow window between which AcH may affect fluorescence by adduct formation with blood components and exogenous fluorophores. Nonetheless, serum has the capacity to bind > 2.5% (> 447 mM) AcH without alteration in fluorescence, suggesting that serum has a great carrying capacity for AcH, undoubtedly in the form of adducts to nucleophiles. These results are discussed in the light of toxicity of AcH and ethanol, the probable significance of the approximately 30 microM free AcH that is reported in chronic alcoholics and the planning of in vitro and in vivo studies with AcH.

9445250|t|Lipoprotein-like phospholipid particles inhibit the smooth muscle cell cytotoxicity of lysophosphatidylcholine and platelet-activating factor.
9445250|a|Oxidation of LDL is associated with degradation of phosphatidylcholine into platelet-activating factor (PAF)-like phospholipids and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). Exposure of cultured human smooth muscle cells to PAF and LPC in a concentration of 25 micromol/L was found to result in complete cell death, as assessed by the MTT cytotoxicity assay and cell counting. Addition of 50 microg/mL apolipoprotein A-I- and apolipoprotein A-I(Milano)-containing phospholipid particles completely inhibited this cytotoxicity. Phospholipid complexes alone were almost as effective, whereas free apolipoprotein A-I(Milano) and albumin were without effect, suggesting that the effect was phospholipid dependent. Experiments using [14C]LPC demonstrated that apolipoprotein A-I- and apolipoprotein A-I(Milano)-containing phospholipid particles effectively bind LPC. The results show that HDL-like phospholipid particles effectively inhibit the toxic effect of phospholipids and other lipid-soluble factors. The ability of HDL to inhibit the proinflammatory and toxic effects of phospholipids generated during oxidation of LDL may be responsible for part of the antiatherogenic properties of HDL.

22493435|t|B-cell translocation gene 2 (BTG2) stimulates cellular antioxidant defenses through the antioxidant transcription factor NFE2L2 in human mammary epithelial cells.
22493435|a|The B-cell translocation gene 2, BTG2, a member of the BTG/TOB (B-cell translocation gene/transducers of ErbB2) gene family, has been implicated in cell cycle regulation, normal development, and possibly tumor suppression. Previously, it was shown that BTG2 expression is lost or down-regulated in human breast cancers. We now report that BTG2 protects human mammary epithelial cells from oxidative stress due to hydrogen peroxide and other oxidants. BTG2 protection against oxidative stress is BRCA1-independent but requires the antioxidant transcription factor NFE2L2 and is associated with up-regulation of the expression of antioxidant enzymes, including catalase and superoxide dismutases 1 and 2. BTG2 stimulation of antioxidant gene expression is also NFE2L2-dependent. We further demonstrate that BTG2 is a binding partner for NFE2L2 and increases its transcriptional activity. In addition, BTG2 is detectable at the antioxidant response element (ARE) of several NFE2L2-responsive genes. Finally, we show that the ability of BTG2 to associate with NFE2L2, to protect cells against oxidative stress, and to stimulate antioxidant gene expression requires box B, a short highly conserved amino acid motif characteristic of BTG2/TOB family proteins, but does not require boxes A or C. These findings suggest a novel role for BTG2 as a co-activator for NFE2L2 in up-regulating cellular antioxidant defenses.

8244516|t|Caffeine attenuates the renal vascular response to angiotensin II infusion.
8244516|a|Non-modulation has been proposed as an intermediate phenotype in human essential hypertension. The trait is characterized by blunted aldosterone and renal plasma flow responses to short-term angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion. Elevated tissue Ang II levels or decreased tissue adenosine levels could account for this decreased sensitivity to Ang II. In support of the latter possibility, endogenous adenosine has been shown to contribute to the renal vasoconstrictive response to Ang II in animals. We therefore tested the hypothesis that endogenous adenosine contributes to modulation of renal plasma flow in sodium-replete humans. We examined the effect of long-term administration of the adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine on baseline renal plasma flow and on the renal plasma flow response to short-term Ang II infusion in six salt-replete normotensive subjects in a single-blind, placebo-controlled study. para-Aminohippurate clearance was used to assess renal plasma flow. Ang II was infused in graded doses (0.3 to 3 ng/kg per minute) in the presence and absence of caffeine (250 mg PO TID for 7 days). Blood pressure, plasma renin activity, Ang II, electrolytes, and para-aminohippurate clearance were measured before and after each dose of Ang II. Caffeine did not alter either baseline blood pressure or the blood pressure response to Ang II but did increase baseline plasma renin activity from 0.72 +/- 0.09 to 1.42 +/- 0.26 ng angiotensin I/mL per hour (P = .01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

9307967|t|Glutathione synthetase is dispensable for growth under both normal and oxidative stress conditions in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae due to an accumulation of the dipeptide gamma-glutamylcysteine.
9307967|a|Glutathione (GSH) synthetase (Gsh2) catalyzes the ATP-dependent synthesis of GSH from gamma-glutamylcysteine (gamma-Glu-Cys) and glycine. GSH2, encoding the Saccharomyces cerevisiae enzyme, was isolated and used to construct strains that either lack or overproduce Gsh2. The identity of GSH2 was confirmed by the following criteria: 1) the predicted Gsh2 protein shared 37-39% identity and 58-60% similarity with GSH synthetases from other eukaryotes, 2) increased gene dosage of GSH2 resulted in elevated Gsh2 enzyme activity, 3) a strain deleted for GSH2 was dependent on exogenous GSH for wild-type growth rates, and 4) the gsh2 mutant lacked GSH and accumulated the dipeptide gamma-Glu-Cys intermediate in GSH biosynthesis. Overexpression of GSH2 had no effect on cellular GSH levels, whereas overexpression of GSH1, encoding the enzyme for the first step in GSH biosynthesis, lead to an approximately twofold increase in GSH levels, consistent with Gsh1 catalyzing the rate-limiting step in GSH biosynthesis. In contrast to a strain deleted for GSH1, which lacks both GSH and gamma-Glu-Cys, the strain deleted for GSH2 was found to be unaffected in mitochondrial function as well as resistance to oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, and the superoxide anion. Furthermore, gamma-Glu-Cys was at least as good as GSH in protecting yeast cells against an oxidant challenge, providing the first evidence that gamma-Glu-Cys can act as an antioxidant and substitute for GSH in a eukaryotic cell. However, the dipeptide could not fully substitute for the essential function of GSH in the cell as shown by the poor growth of the gsh2 mutant on minimal medium. We suggest that this function may be the detoxification of harmful intermediates that are generated during normal cellular metabolism.

19531482|t|cAMP stringently regulates human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide expression in the mucosal epithelial cells by activating cAMP-response element-binding protein, AP-1, and inducible cAMP early repressor.
19531482|a|Little is known about the regulation of the innate host defense peptide cathelicidin at the mucosal surfaces. Expression is believed to be transcriptionally regulated, and several cis-acting elements have been identified in the cathelicidin putative promoter. However, the trans-acting factors have not been clearly defined. We have recently reported that bacterial exotoxins suppress cathelicidin expression in sodium butyrate-differentiated intestinal epithelial cells (ECs), and this may be mediated through inducible cAMP early repressor. Here we have shown that cAMP-signaling pathways transcriptionally regulate cathelicidin expression in various ECs. cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) and AP-1 (activator protein-1) bind to the cathelicidin putative promoter in vitro. Additionally, transcriptional complexes containing CREB, AP-1, and cathelicidin upstream regulatory sequences are formed within ECs. We have also shown that these complexes may activate cathelicidin promoter and are required for its inducible expression in ECs. This is underscored by the fact that silencing of CREB and AP-1 results in failure of ECs to up-regulate cathelicidin, and hepatitis B virus X protein may use CREB to induce cathelicidin. On the other hand, inducible cAMP early repressor competes with CREB and AP-1 for binding to the cathelicidin promoter and represses transcription, thus functioning as a counter-regulatory mechanism. Finally, both CREB and AP-1 were shown to play major roles in the regulation of cathelicidin in sodium butyrate-differentiated HT-29 cells. This is the first report of a detailed mechanistic study of inducible cathelicidin expression in the mucosal ECs. At the same time, it describes a novel immunomodulatory function of cAMP.

Under the optimal experimental conditions, the immunosensor presented a wide linear range from 0.2 to 500nM and a low detection limit of 0.078nM (S/N=3). The reproducibility and specificity were acceptable. Moreover, the developed method was also validated for detect m6A content in human cell lines. Importantly, this detection strategy provides a promising immunodetection platform for ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides with the advantages of simplicity, low-costing, specificity and sensitivity.

6294446|t|Status of the red cell Na,K-pump in hyper- and hypothyroidism.
6294446|a|To investigate the status of the sodium-potassium pump in cells of human subjects with abnormal thyroid function, we measured the number of pump units as well as the cation transport activity of the pump in erythrocytes from 23 hyperthyroid and 7 hypothyroid patients. It was found that the number of Na+-K+-ATPase units in erythrocytes (as measured by ouabain binding) was significantly reduced in hyperthyroidism (mean 36% below controls, p less than 0.001). The rate of rubidium uptake by the same cells was also reduced, but to a smaller extent (mean 9%, p less than 0.02). These changes were reversible with control of the hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroid individuals showed changes in erythrocyte Na+-K+ pump which were in the opposite direction to those seen in hyperthyroidism. It is concluded that thyroid hormone exerts a marked negative influence on the number of Na+-K+ pump units in one easily available human cell type. The direction of the effect suggests a complex relationship between thyroid hormone and the level of the Na,K-ATPase in any one tissue. Whatever the cellular mechanism responsible for the effects observed in the red cell, these changes should provide a measure of thyroid hormone action at a cellular level and this may prove useful in the study of thyroid hormone physiology in man.

25707293|t|Actual Isothermal Effects of Water-Filtered Infrared A-Irradiation.
25707293|a|In this study, the athermal effects of water-filtered infrared A (wIRA)-irradiation (780-1400 nm) on human dermal fibroblasts were investigated. For this purpose, cells were exposed to wIRA-irradiation (178 mW cm(-2) for 1 h), while a sophisticated experimental setup prevented warming of the samples exceeding 0.1°C. The investigated parameters were the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential and superoxide release, protein oxidation, proliferation rate, as well as intracellular Ca(2+) -release in single cells, most of them quantified via fluorescence microscopy and fluorimetric techniques. The existence of actual athermal wIRA-effects is still intensively discussed, since their detection requires a careful experimental setup and both efficient and powerful temperature regulation of the exposed samples. Here, we can definitively show that some of the supposed athermal wIRA-effects may be rather artifacts, since wIRA did not reveal any impact on the above mentioned parameters-as long as the temperature of the exposed cells was carefully maintained. Though, we were able to identify an athermal DNA-protective wIRA-effect, since the induced DNA damage (quantified via 8-Oxo-G-formation) was significantly decreased after a subsequent UVB-exposure. These results suggest that many of the supposed athermal wIRA-effects can be induced by pure warming of the samples, independent from any wIRA-irradiation.

1439791|t|A GDP dissociation inhibitor that serves as a GTPase inhibitor for the Ras-like protein CDC42Hs.
1439791|a|Members of the family of Ras-related guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding proteins appear to take part in the regulation of a number of biological processes, including cell growth and differentiation. Three different classes of proteins that regulate the GTP binding and GTP hydrolytic activities of the Ras family members have been identified. These different regulatory proteins inhibit guanosine diphosphate (GDP) dissociation (designated as GDIs), stimulate GDP dissociation and GDP-GTP exchange (designated as GDSs), or stimulate GTP hydrolysis (designated as GAPs). In the case of the Ras-like protein CDC42Hs, which is the human homolog of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell division cycle protein, the GDI protein also inhibited both the intrinsic and GAP-stimulated hydrolysis of GTP. These findings establish an additional role for the GDI protein--namely, as a guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) inhibitory protein for a Ras-like GTP binding protein.

18300910|t|Targeting the alpha 1 subunit of the sodium pump to combat glioblastoma cells.
18300910|a|OBJECTIVE: Ion transporters play pivotal roles in cancer cell migration in general and in glioblastomas (GBMs) in particular. However, the specific role of Na/K-ATPase (the sodium pump) and, in particular, its alpha1 subunit, has remained unexplored in GBMs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of Na+/K+ -ATPase alpha1 in GBM clinical samples, normal brain tissue, and a human GBM cell line has been investigated. Using the novel cardenolide UNBS1450 (Unibioscreen, Brussels, Belgium), which is a ligand of the sodium pump, we have characterized the effects of inhibiting Na+/K+ -ATPase alpha1 in human GBM cells with respect to cell proliferation; morphology; impact on intracellular Na+, Ca2+, and adenosine triphosphate; and changes in the actin cytoskeleton. We have investigated the mechanism by which UNBS1450 overcomes the apoptosis resistance of GBMs and determined its anti-tumor effects in comparative studies in vitro in GBM cell viability assays and in vivo using an orthotopic human GBM xenograft model. RESULTS: Overall, the alpha1 subunit of Na+/K+ -ATPase is highly expressed in a majority of glioblastomas compared with normal brain tissues, and by binding to this subunit in human U373-MG GBM cells, UNBS1450 impairs cell proliferation and migration via an intracellular adenosine triphosphate decrease-mediated disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and cytotoxic proautophagic effects. UNBS1450 also significantly increases the in vivo survival of mice orthotopically grafted with U373-MG GBM cells. CONCLUSION: Inhibition of the Na+/K+ -ATPase alpha1 subunit in human GBM cells impairs both cell migration and cell proliferation.

25615711|t|Molecular mechanism of cell death induced by king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah) venom l-amino acid oxidase.
25615711|a|Snake venom LAAOs have been reported to exhibit a wide range of pharmacological activities, including cytotoxic, edema-inducing, platelet aggregation-inducing/platelet aggregation-inhibiting, bactericidal and antiviral activities. A heat-stable form of l-amino acid oxidase isolated from king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah) venom (OH-LAAO) has been shown to exhibit very potent cytotoxicity against human tumorigenic cells but not in their non-tumorigenic counterparts, and the cytotoxicity was due to the apoptosis-inducing effect of the enzyme. In this work, the molecular mechanism of cell death induced by OH-LAAO was investigated. The enzyme exerts its apoptosis-inducing effect presumably via both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways as suggested by the increase in caspase-8 and -9 activities. Oligonucleotide microarray analysis showed that the expression of a total of 178 genes was significantly altered as a result of oxidative stress induced by the hydrogen peroxide generated by the enzyme. Of the 178 genes, at least 27 genes are involved in apoptosis and cell death. These alterations of gene expression was presumably caused by the direct cytotoxic effect of H2O2 generated during the enzymatic reaction, as well as the non-specific oxidative modifications of signaling molecules that eventually lead to apoptosis and cell death. The very substantial up-regulation of cytochrome P450 genes may also contribute to the potent cytotoxic action of OH-LAAO by producing excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS). In conclusion, the potent apoptosis inducing activity of OH-LAAO was likely due to the direct cytotoxic effect of H2O2 generated during the enzymatic reaction, as well as the non-specific oxidation of signalling molecules.

25363902|t|Isomers and their metabolites of endosulfan induced cytotoxicity and oxidative damage in SH-SY5Y cells.
25363902|a|As an organochlorine insecticide, endosulfan has been widely banned or restricted, but it is still largely used in many developing countries. Previous studies have shown multiple adverse health effects of endosulfan. However, the neurotoxicity of endosulfan has not been fully elucidated. In this study, endosulfan isomers (α-/β-endosulfan) and their major metabolites (endosulfan sulfate, endosulfan diol, and endosulfan lactone) were, respectively, exposed to human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Results showed that both α-endosulfan and β-endosulfan caused decrease of cell viability and morphological damages in a dose-dependent manner. Their median effective concentrations (EC50s) were respectively 79.6 μM (α-endosulfan) and 50.37 μM (β-endosulfan) for 72 h exposure. EC50s of α/β-endosulfan mixture were lower than that of the single isomer. However, EC50s of its metabolites were higher than that of technical endosulfan. Endosulfan and its metabolites caused increases of reactive oxygen species and the lipid peroxidation, but decrease of superoxide dismutase in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that α-endosulfan exhibits higher neurotoxicity than β-endosulfan. Mixture of endosulfan isomers shows stronger cytotoxicity than the single isomer. After endosulfan is degraded, cytotoxicity of its metabolites decreases gradually. The neurotoxicity of endosulfan and its metabolites is closely related to oxidative damage and antioxidative deficit.

4017990|t|Effects of exposure of blood hemoglobin to nitric oxide.
4017990|a|The effect of oxygen exposure on nitrosylhemoglobin of whole human blood or its buffered solution has been determined. The amount of methemoglobin formed was determined by an anaerobic modification of the Evelyn-Malloy method; 59% of the total hemoglobin of whole blood was oxidized to methemoglobin in the first 15 min of the oxygen exposure and 78% of the total hemoglobin was oxidized after 120 min of oxygen exposure. Similar results were obtained when nitrosylhemoglobin buffered solutions were exposed to the oxygen of the air. A comparison of the present in vitro results with these obtained by injecting nitric oxide into the rat peritoneal cavity and its implications are discussed.

15155544|t|Noninvasive glucose monitoring by reverse iontophoresis in vivo: application of the internal standard concept.
15155544|a|BACKGROUND: The GlucoWatch Biographer uses reverse iontophoresis to extract glucose across the skin to monitor glycemia in diabetes. The invasive daily calibration with a conventional "fingerstick" has been perceived as a disadvantage. We used an "internal standard" to render the approach completely noninvasive. METHODS: The simultaneous extraction of glucose and sodium by reverse iontophoresis was performed on human volunteers over 5 h, and blood glucose was measured in the conventional manner at each collection interval. These data were used for each volunteer to calculate an extraction constant (K), which equals the ratio of the extracted fluxes (JGlucose/JNa+) normalized by the corresponding ratio of the concentrations in the blood ([Glucose]/[Na+]). The values of K were compared between and within volunteers. RESULTS: The iontophoretically extracted glucose flux reflected the glucose concentration profiles in the blood, and sodium extraction remained essentially constant, consistent with the fact that its systemic concentration does not vary significantly. A constant value of K was established for two thirds of the study population. However, the efficiency of glucose extraction varied seasonally, whereas the reverse iontophoresis of Na+ did not; i.e., variation in K became apparent. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the sodium ion as an internal standard could refine the determination of glycemia by reverse iontophoresis without requiring calibration with a blood sample.

12572854|t|The role of hydrogen peroxide in endothelial proliferative responses.
12572854|a|Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a recently recognized second messenger regulating proliferation in mammalian cells. Endothelial cells possess NADPH oxidases, which produce the H202 precursor superoxide (.O2-) in response to receptor-mediated signaling. Multiple physiologic agents have been shown to stimulate endothelial cells to produce .O2-/H2O2, including growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor and transforming growth factor-beta1, and alterations in biomechanical forces, such as shear stress and cyclic strain. Downstream effects of these stimuli can often be inhibited by scavenging H2O2. Low concentrations of H2O2 stimulate proliferation or enhanced survival in a wide variety of cell types. Also, low concentrations of H2O2 stimulate endothelial migration as well as tube formation in an in vitro model of angiogenesis. Although low concentrations of H2O2 have been shown to be involved in numerous signal transduction pathways and to independently stimulate mitogenesis, there has been little information presented on precisely how mammalian cells respond biochemically to these low concentrations of H2O2. Recently a functional proteomics approach has been utilized to identify proteins responsive to low concentrations of H2O2 in human endothelial cells.

19126751|t|Heat shock response protects human peritoneal mesothelial cells from dialysate-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial injury.
19126751|a|BACKGROUND: Chronic peritoneal dialysis (PD) is one of the major therapies for uremic patients. However, the peritoneal mesothelial cells (PMCs) are subject to the injury by bioincompatible dialysates. The aim of this study is to investigate the protective roles and mechanisms of heat shock response in PMCs. METHODS: Primary cultured human PMCs (HPMCs) were subjected to commercial peritoneal dialysates. The cell viability was assayed by MTT test and Annexin V assay. The expression of HSPs was detected by Western blots analysis. Intracellular hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion were detected using H(2)DCFDA and dHE probe, respectively, with flow cytometry. The mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) of HPMCs was evaluated using JC1 probe with flow-cytometry. RESULTS: Exposure of HPMCs to 1.5%, 2.5%, and 4.25% dextrose, and 7.5% icodextrin dialysates, respectively, for 60 min resulted in significantly accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), DeltaPsim loss, and cell death in HPMCs. Amino acid dialysates exhibited no significant cytotoxicity. Adjusting the acidity in 1.5% dextrose and icodextrin dialysate significantly attenuated the dialysate-induced ROS generation and cell death in HPMCs. Heat pretreatment (41 degrees C, 30 minutes), which induced HSP 27 and 72 syntheses, significantly attenuated the dialysate-induced intracellular ROS accumulation, Dym loss, and cell death in HPMCs. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the acidic bioincompatible dialysates induce oxidative stress, DeltaPsim loss, and subsequent cell death in HPMCs. Amino acid dialysates is more biocompatible than glucose and icodextrin dialysates to HPMCs. Heat shock response protects HPMCs from the bioincompatible dialysates-induced cellular damage.

24722456|t|Antiplatelet activity, P2Y₁ and P2Y₁₂ inhibition, and metabolism in plasma of stereoisomers of diadenosine 5',5'″-P¹ ,P⁴-dithio-P²,P³-chloromethylenetetraphosphate.
24722456|a|BACKGROUND: Diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A), a constituent of platelet dense granules, and its P1,P4-dithio and/or P2,P3-chloromethylene analogs, inhibit adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation. We recently reported that these compounds antagonize both platelet ADP receptors, P2Y1 and P2Y12. The most active of those analogs, diadenosine 5',5″″-P1,P4-dithio-P2,P3-chloromethylenetetraphosphate, (compound 1), exists as a mixture of 4 stereoisomers. OBJECTIVE: To separate the stereoisomers of compound 1 and determine their effects on platelet aggregation, platelet P2Y1 and P2Y12 receptor antagonism, and their metabolism in human plasma. METHODS: We separated the 4 diastereomers of compound 1 by preparative reversed-phase chromatography, and studied their effect on ADP-induced platelet aggregation, P2Y1-mediated changes in cytosolic Ca2+, P2Y12-mediated changes in VASP phosphorylation, and metabolism in human plasma. RESULTS: The inhibition of ADP-induced human platelet aggregation and human platelet P2Y12 receptor, and stability in human plasma strongly depended on the stereo-configuration of the chiral P1- and P4-phosphorothioate groups, the SPSP diastereomer being the most potent inhibitor and completely resistant to degradation in plasma, and the RPRP diastereomer being the least potent inhibitor and with the lowest plasma stability. The inhibitory activity of SPRP diastereomers depended on the configuration of the pseudo-asymmetric carbon of the P2,P3-chloromethylene group, one of the configurations being significantly more active than the other. Their plasma stability did not differ significantly, being intermediate to that of the SPSP and the RPRP diastereomers. CONCLUSIONS: The presently-described stereoisomers have utility for structural, mechanistic, and drug development studies of dual antagonists of platelet P2Y1 and P2Y12 receptors.

28733125|t|Modulation of inflammatory and immune responses by vitamin D.
28733125|a|Vitamin D (VitD) is a prohormone most noted for the regulation of calcium and phosphate levels in circulation, and thus of bone metabolism. Inflammatory and immune cells not only convert inactive VitD metabolites into calcitriol, the active form of VitD, but also express the nuclear receptor of VitD that modulates differentiation, activation and proliferation of these cells. In vitro, calcitriol upregulates different anti-inflammatory pathways and downregulates molecules that activate immune and inflammatory cells. Administration of VitD has beneficial effects in a number of experimental models of autoimmune disease. Epidemiologic studies have indicated that VitD insufficiency is frequently associated with immune disorders and infectious diseases, exacerbated by increasing evidence of suboptimal VitD status in populations worldwide. To date, however, most interventional studies in human inflammatory and immune diseases with VitD supplementation have proven to be inconclusive. One of the reasons could be that the main VitD metabolite measured in these studies was the 25-hydroxyVitD (25OHD) rather than its active form calcitriol. Although our knowledge of calcitriol as modulator of immune and inflammatory reactions has dramatically increased in the past decades, further in vivo and clinical studies are needed to confirm the potential benefits of VitD in the control of immune and inflammatory conditions.

27129288|t|Iron-chelating agent desferrioxamine stimulates formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in human blood-derived neutrophils.
27129288|a|Neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation is a significant innate immune defense mechanism against microbial infection that complements other neutrophil functions including phagocytosis and degranulation of antimicrobial peptides. NETs are decondensed chromatin structures in which antimicrobial components (histones, antimicrobial peptides and proteases) are deployed and mediate immobilization of microbes. Here we describe an effect of iron chelation on the phenotype of NET formation. Iron-chelating agent desferrioxamine (DFO) showed a modest but significant induction of NETs by freshly isolated human neutrophils as visualized and quantified by immunocytochemistry against histone-DNA complexes. Further analyses revealed that NET induction by iron chelation required NADPH-dependent production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as protease and peptidyl-arginine-deiminase 4 (PAD4) activities, three key mechanistic pathways previously linked to NET formation. Our results demonstrate that iron chelation by DFO contributes to the formation of NETs and suggest a target for pharmacological manipulation of NET activity.

20367598|t|Mitochondria as source of reactive oxygen species under oxidative stress. Study with novel mitochondria-targeted antioxidants--the "Skulachev-ion" derivatives.
20367598|a|Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria was studied using the novel mitochondria-targeted antioxidants (SkQ) in cultures of human cells. It was shown that SkQ rapidly (1-2 h) and selectively accumulated in mitochondria and prevented oxidation of mitochondrial components under oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide. At nanomolar concentrations, SkQ inhibited oxidation of glutathione, fragmentation of mitochondria, and translocation of Bax from cytosol into mitochondria. The last effect could be related to prevention of conformational change in the adenine nucleotide transporter, which depends on oxidation of critical thiols. Mitochondria-targeted antioxidants at nanomolar concentrations prevented accumulation of ROS and cell death under oxidative stress. These effects required 24 h or more (depending on the cell type) preincubation, and this was not related to slow induction of endogenous antioxidant systems. It is suggested that SkQ slowly accumulates in a small subpopulation of mitochondria that have decreased membrane potential and produce the major part of ROS under oxidative stress. This population was visualized in the cells using potential-sensitive dye. The possible role of the small fraction of "bad" mitochondria in cell physiology is discussed.

15377492|t|Adenovirus stimulates choline efflux by increasing expression of organic cation transporter-2.
15377492|a|We examined the effect of wild-type human adenovirus (Ad5) on choline transport in murine lung epithelia (MLE) and in rodent primary alveolar type II cells. Cells were active in pH-sensitive, reversible transport of choline, a process blocked pharmacologically with phenoxybenzamine, an inhibitor of organic cation transporters (OCT). PCR products for the choline transporters, OCT-1 and OCT-2, were detected, but only OCT-2 protein was robustly expressed within MLE and primary alveolar epithelial cells. Ad5 produced a two- to threefold increase in choline efflux from cells, resulting in a significant reduction in intracellular choline content and its major product, phosphatidylcholine. Effects of Ad5 on choline efflux were inhibited with phenoxybenzamine, and choline efflux was attenuated by OCT-2 small interfering RNA. Adenovirus also produced a dose-dependent increase in immunoreactive OCT-2 levels concomitant with increased cellular OCT-2 steady-state mRNA. These results indicate that adenoviruses can significantly disrupt choline trafficking in lung epithelia by upregulating expression of an alveolar protein involved in organic cation transport.

15582582|t|Crystal structure of human PNP complexed with hypoxanthine and sulfate ion.
15582582|a|Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) is a ubiquitous enzyme, which plays a key role in the purine salvage pathway, and PNP deficiency in humans leads to an impairment of T-cell function, usually with no apparent effects on B-cell function. Human PNP has been submitted to intensive structure-based design of inhibitors, most of them using low-resolution structures of human PNP. Here we report the crystal structure of human PNP in complex with hypoxanthine, refined to 2.6A resolution. The intermolecular interaction between ligand and PNP is discussed.

12918029|t|TEGDMA-induced toxicity in human fibroblasts is associated with early and drastic glutathione depletion with subsequent production of oxygen reactive species.
12918029|a|Triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) is a dentin-bonding agent and a major component of various dental restorative biomaterials. TEGDMA monomers are released from dental resins and induce dental pulp inflammation and necrosis. In this study, we have investigated the mechanism of TEGDMA-induced cytotoxicity of fibroblasts. Treatment of cultured human gingival and pulpal fibroblasts with 0.1-3 mM of TEGDMA for 24 h induced a concentration-dependent and variable cytotoxic effect. Fifty percent of toxicity (TC(50)) was obtained with 1.2 +/- 0.9 and 2.6 +/- 1.1 mM of TEGDMA for gingival and pulpal fibroblasts, respectively. Moreover, TEGDMA-induced cytotoxicity was associated with an early and drastic depletion of cellular glutathione (GSH), which started at 15-30 min and was almost complete at 4-6 h. Antioxidants, such as Trolox (0.01 mM), ascorbate (0.2 mM), and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (5 mM) prevented the TEGDMA-induced cytotoxicity while GSH depletion was partially inhibited. Finally, a late production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) occurred in fibroblasts treated with TEGDMA for 3-4 h, as determined by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein fluorescence, and was completely inhibited by Trolox (5 microM). The data show that TEGDMA induced a drastic GSH depletion followed by production of ROS, which may contribute to the toxicity of gingival and pulpal fibroblasts. Antioxidants, such as NAC, ascorbate, and particularly Trolox, appear useful in preventing cell damage mediated by resin-containing dental restorative materials.

1971575|t|Disposition of a new orally active dopamine prodrug, N-(N-acetyl-L-methionyl)-O,O-bis(ethoxycarbonyl) dopamine (TA-870) in humans.
1971575|a|Dopamine (DA) levels in human plasma after oral administration of TA-870 and iv infusion of DA were measured by HPLC. The metabolites of TA-870 or DA in plasma and urine were also determined. The maximal concentrations (Cmax) of free DA in plasma after oral administration of 750 and 1500 mg of TA-870 to humans were 63 and 127 ng/ml, respectively, being higher than the concentrations of 8 and 31 ng/ml following the infusion of 1 and 3 micrograms/kg/min, the clinical doses of DA. These results demonstrated the clinical usefulness of TA-870. The plasma level of free deethoxycarbonylated TA-870 (DEC-TA-870) after oral administration of TA-870 was higher than that of DA. After oral administration of TA-870, the concentration of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in plasma was higher than that after DA infusion, but the concentration of homovanillic acid (HVA) was about the same as that after DA infusion. The level of the total urinary metabolites (free and conjugated) after oral administration of TA-870 decreased as follows: DA greater than HVA greater than DOPAC greater than DEC-TA-870. The conjugated/free ratios of urinary metabolites after TA-870 dosing were 40-66 for DA, 0.5 for HVA, 0.6-0.9 for DOPAC, and 5.0-6.2 for DEC-TA-870. The composition of urinary metabolites after oral dosing of TA-870 was almost the same as that the DA metabolites. These results show that TA-870 is rapidly converted to DA in the human body.

8225757|t|Metabolic disturbances in Plasmodium coatneyi-infected rhesus monkeys.
8225757|a|To investigate metabolic disturbances in an animal model of human malaria, four rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were infected with Plasmodium coatneyi, a parasite which induces cytoadherence of infected erythrocytes. When moribund or the parasitaemia had plateaued, the monkeys were sacrificed (3 animals) or treated with chloroquine (1 animal). Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were sampled at intervals between inoculation and sacrifice or treatment. Arterial and CSF glucose and lactate rose during infection, indicating evolving insulin resistance. The arteriovenous difference in glucose concentration also increased, consistent with increased glucose consumption by parasitised tissues. Arterial plasma lactate rose but a positive arteriovenous concentration difference suggested tissue lactate uptake. The animal with the highest plasma lactate at sacrifice remained hyperglycaemic but also had the highest CSF lactate, the greatest cerebral sequestration and neurological depression, and biochemical and histological evidence of severe hepatic pathology. Serum cholesterol and corrected serum calcium fell consistently during infection; serum phosphate was also reduced in animals without renal impairment. These preliminary results indicate that lactic acidosis is a late complication of severe malaria and, by implication from this and other studies, hypoglycaemia occurs even later; other metabolic changes during P. coatneyi infection in rhesus monkeys also parallel those of severe falciparum malaria in humans. The model could be used in further studies of malaria-associated metabolic dysfunction and its management.

8993004|t|Eosinophils transcribe and translate messenger RNA for inducible nitric oxide synthase.
8993004|a|Because of the involvement of nitric oxide (NO) in inflammatory states such as parasitic and hypersensitivity disorders and the fact that eosinophils are one of the cell types implicated, we asked whether eosinophils were able to express mRNA specific to inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and iNOS protein and to secrete nitric oxide. iNOS protein was detected on eosinophil preparations by immunocytochemistry using iNOS mAb. Expression of iNOS protein was also detected by immunoblotting in human purified eosinophils and an eosinophilic leukemia cell line, Eol-3. Nitrite production was detected in the supernatant of human eosinophils and Eol-3 cells cultured for 24 h, and was completely inhibited in the presence of the NOS inhibitor N-methylester-L-arginine. iNOS cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR. After subcloning, sequencing of the 259-bp fragment from three different human eosinophils cDNAs revealed 97% identity with macrophage/monocyte iNOS. Our studies describe for the first time the presence of iNOS on eosinophil and a putative new role for this cell in inflammatory states such as asthma and parasitic disease.

23535287|t|Cajaninstilbene acid (CSA) exerts cytoprotective effects against oxidative stress through the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant pathway.
23535287|a|Cajaninstilbene acid (CSA), an active compound separated from pigeon pea leaves, possesses the highly efficient antioxidant activities. Transcription factor nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is an important regulator of cellular oxidative stress. This study examined the role of Nrf2 in CSA-mediated antioxidant effects on human hepatocarcinoma (HepG2) cell line. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon H2O2 and CSA treatment was lower than that of H2O2 alone. CSA activated Nrf2 as evaluated by Western blotting. A luciferase reporter assay also demonstrated that CSA-activated signaling resulted in the increased transcriptional activity of Nrf2 through binding to the antioxidant response element (ARE) enhancer sequence. Our study indicated that treatment of HepG2 cells with CSA induces Nrf2-dependent ARE activity and gene expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunits by activation of PI3K/AKT, ERK and JNK signaling pathways. Inhibition of Nrf2 by siRNA reduced CSA-induced upregulation of these Nrf2-related enzymes. These results suggest that the Nrf2/ARE pathway plays an important role in the regulation of CSA-mediated antioxidant effects in HepG2 cells.

14573732|t|Glutathione peroxidase 1 activity and cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease.
14573732|a|BACKGROUND: Cellular antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase 1 and superoxide dismutase have a central role in the control of reactive oxygen species. In vitro data and studies in animal models suggest that these enzymes may protect against atherosclerosis, but little is known about their relevance to human disease. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study among 636 patients with suspected coronary artery disease, with a median follow-up period of 4.7 years (maximum, 5.4) to assess the risk of cardiovascular events associated with base-line erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase 1 and superoxide dismutase activity. RESULTS: Glutathione peroxidase 1 activity was among the strongest univariate predictors of the risk of cardiovascular events, whereas superoxide dismutase activity had no association with risk. The risk of cardiovascular events was inversely associated with increasing quartiles of glutathione peroxidase 1 activity (P for trend <0.001); patients in the highest quartile of glutathione peroxidase 1 activity had a hazard ratio of 0.29 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.15 to 0.58; P<0.001), as compared with those in the lowest quartile. Glutathione peroxidase 1 activity was affected by sex and smoking status but retained its predictive power in these subgroups. After adjustment for these and other cardiovascular risk factors, the inverse association between glutathione peroxidase 1 activity and cardiovascular events remained nearly unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with coronary artery disease, a low level of activity of red-cell glutathione peroxidase 1 is independently associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Glutathione peroxidase 1 activity may have prognostic value in addition to that of traditional risk factors. Furthermore, increasing glutathione peroxidase 1 activity might lower the risk of cardiovascular events.

10694524|t|Study on the relationship between plasma nitrite and nitrate level and salt sensitivity in human hypertension : modulation of nitric oxide synthesis by salt intake.
10694524|a|BACKGROUND: High salt intake suppresses the effect of nitric oxide (NO) in the peripheral resistance vessels in animal models. We tested the hypothesis that the modulation of endogenous NO is related to salt sensitivity in human hypertension. METHODS AND RESULTS: Inpatients with essential hypertension (n=24) were maintained on a normal-salt diet (12 g/d NaCl) for 3 days, a low-salt diet (2 g), a high-salt diet (20 to 23 g), and a low-salt diet for 7 days. Normotensive subjects (n=16) were maintained on the first 2 salt diets. The hypertensive patients whose average 24-hour blood pressure was increased by >5% by salt loading were assigned to group 1 (n=8) and the others to group 2 (n=16). Nitrate plus nitrite (NO(x)) was measured by the Griess method, and asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA) by high-performance liquid chromatography. The plasma NO(x) level during the normal-salt diet was lower in group 1 than in group 2 and the normotensive group. After salt loading, the plasma NO(x) level was decreased and reversed after the second salt restriction. Plasma ADMA level was increased after salt loading and decreased after salt restriction. The change in plasma NO(x) level was correlated inversely with those in blood pressure (r=-0.59, P=0.0007) and plasma ADMA level (r=-0.64, P=0.003) after salt loading and restriction. CONCLUSIONS: Modulation of NO synthesis by salt intake may be involved in a mechanism for salt sensitivity in human hypertension, presumably via the change in ADMA.

26493872|t|Olfactory Dysfunctions and Decreased Nitric Oxide Production in the Brain of Human P301L Tau Transgenic Mice.
26493872|a|Different patterns of olfactory dysfunction have been found in both patients and mouse models of Alzheimer's Disease. However, the underlying mechanism of the dysfunction remained unknown. Deficits of nitric oxide production in brain can cause olfactory dysfunction by preventing the formation of olfactory memory. The aim of this study was to investigate the behavioral changes in olfaction and alterations in metabolites of nitric oxide, nitrate/nitrite concentration, in the brain of human P301L tau transgenic mice. The tau mice showed impairments in olfaction and increased abnormal phosphorylation of Tau protein at AT8 in different brain areas, especially in olfactory bulb. We now report that these olfactory deficits and Tau pathological changes were accompanied by decreased nitrate/nitrite concentration in the brain, especially in the olfactory bulb, and reduced expression of nNOS in the brain of tau mice. These findings provided evidence of olfactory dysfunctions correlated with decreased nitric oxide production in the brain of tau mice.

17645370|t|Thermoregulation during exercise in the heat: strategies for maintaining health and performance.
17645370|a|As a result of the inefficiency of metabolic transfer, >75% of the energy that is generated by skeletal muscle substrate oxidation is liberated as heat. During exercise, several powerful physiological mechanisms of heat loss are activated to prevent an excessive rise in body core temperature. However, a hot and humid environment can significantly add to the challenge that physical exercise imposes on the human thermoregulatory system, as heat exchange between body and environment is substantially impaired under these conditions. This can lead to serious performance decrements and an increased risk of developing heat illness. Fortunately, there are a number of strategies that athletes can use to prevent and/or reduce the dangers that are associated with exercise in the heat. In this regard, heat acclimatisation and nutritional intervention seem to be most effective. During heat acclimatisation, the temperature thresholds for both cutaneous vasodilation and the onset of sweating are lowered, which, in combination with plasma volume expansion, improve cardiovascular stability. Effective nutritional interventions include the optimisation of hydration status by the use of fluid replacement beverages. The latter should contain moderate amounts of glucose and sodium, which improve both water absorption and retention.

8960641|t|Hemoglobin-induced contraction of pig pulmonary veins.
8960641|a|The effects of hemoglobin Ao (HbAo), alpha alpha cross-linked hemoglobin (alpha alphaHb), cyanomet alpha alpha cross-linked hemoglobin (cyanomet alpha alphaHb), and human serum albumin (HSA) were compared under basal conditions and during relaxation with acetylcholine (ACh), sodium nitroprusside (SNP), and papaverine (PAP) in porcine pulmonary veins. Isometric tension changes were recorded in isolated rings (3 to 4 mm) that were suspended in Krebs solution bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2. Increasing concentrations of HbAo and alpha alphaHb (10(-9) - 3 x 10(-6) mol/L) caused concentration-dependent increases in tension that reached a maximum of 4.20 +/- 0.3 gm and 3.78 +/- 0.6 gm, respectively. Cyanomet alpha alphaHb and HSA (10(-9) - 3 x 10(-6) mol/L) did not cause significant increases in tension. The maximum responses to HbAo and alpha alphaHb were significantly increased during relaxation with ACh and SNP but not with PAP. In contrast, SNP (10(-4) mol/L) and PAP (10(-5) mol/L), but not ACh, reversed contractions induced by HbAo and alpha alphaHb. These studies support the concept that hemoglobin-induced vascular contraction is primarily mediated by inactivation of the vasodilator nitric oxide in vitro. We suggest that this mechanism is common to acellular hemoglobins in which the ligand binding site is unimpaired and in which the heme iron is in the ferrous (+2) state.

15485492|t|HaRas activates the NADPH oxidase complex in human neuroblastoma cells via extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathway.
15485492|a|In this study we have investigated the effects of the small GTP-binding-protein Ras on the redox signalling of the human neuroblastoma cell line, SK-N-BE stably transfected with HaRas(Val12). The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide anions were significantly higher in HaRas(Val12) expressing (SK-HaRas) cells than in control cells. The treatment of cells with 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonylfluoride, a specific inhibitor of the membrane superoxide generating system NADPH oxidase, suppressed the rise in ROS and significantly reduced superoxide levels produced by SK-HaRas cells. Moreover, HaRas(Val12) induced the translocation of the cytosolic components of the NADPH oxidase complex p67(phox) and Rac to the plasma membrane. These effects depended on the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK1/2) pathway, as the specific MEK inhibitor, PD98059, prevented HaRas-mediated increase in ROS and superoxide anions. In contrast, the specific phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin were unable to reverse the effects of HaRas(Val12). Moreover, cholinergic stimulation of neuroblastoma cells by carbachol, which activated endogenous Ras/ERK1/2, induced a significant increase in ROS levels and elicited membrane translocation of p67(phox) and Rac. ROS generation induced by carbachol required the activation of ERK1/2 and PI3K. Hence, these data indicate that HaRas-induced ERK1/2 signalling selectively activates NADPH oxidase system in neuroblastoma cells.

18855474|t|Catalytic reduction of dioxygen and nitrite ion at a Met80Ala cytochrome c-functionalized electrode.
18855474|a|The Met80Ala variant of yeast iso-1-cytochrome c, immobilized on a gold electrode, is found to exchange electrons efficiently with it in nondenaturing conditions and to provide robust and persistent catalytic currents for O 2 and nitrite ion reduction from pH 3 to 11. Direct covalent protein linkage to gold yields the best electrochemical and electrocatalytic performances without drastically affecting the structural properties of the bound protein compared to the freely diffusing species. Therefore, this biocatalytic interface can be of use for the amperometric detection of the above species, which are of great environmental, industrial, and clinical interest, with particular reference to the exploitation in nanostructured biosensing devices. This work shows that the use of a small engineered electron transfer (ET) protein, featuring an axial heme iron coordination position available for the binding of exogenous ligands, in place of a large heme enzyme is a viable strategy for the improvement of the heterogeneous ET rate and the stability and efficiency of sensing gold-protein interfaces over a wide range of T and pH.

17146665|t|In planta AKT2 subunits constitute a pH- and Ca2+-sensitive inward rectifying K+ channel.
17146665|a|Heterologous expression of plant genes in yeast and animal cells represents a common approach to study plant ion channels. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes and COS cells the Arabidopsis Shaker-like K+ channel, AKT2 forms a weakly voltage-dependent channel, blocked by Ca2+ and protons. Channels with these characteristics, however, were not found in AKT2-expressing Arabidopsis cell types. To understand this phenomenon, we employed Agrobacterium-mediated transient transformation to functionally characterise Arabidopsis thaliana channels in Nicotiana benthamiana mesophyll cells. In this expression system we used AtTPK4 as a control for voltage-independent A. thaliana channels. Agrobacteria harbouring GFP-tagged constructs with the coding sequences of AKT2 and AtTPK4 were infiltrated into intact tobacco leaves. With quantitative RT-PCR analyses channel transcripts of AKT2 and AtTPK4 were determined in transformed leaves. These results were confirmed by Western blots with V5 epitope-tagged AKT2 and AtTPK4 proteins, showing that the channel protein was indeed synthesised. For functional analysis of these channels, mesophyll protoplasts were isolated from infiltrated leaf sections. Patch-clamp studies revealed that AKT2 channels in mesophyll protoplasts retained Ca2+ and pH sensitivity, characteristics of the heterologously expressed protein, but displayed pronounced differences in voltage-dependence and kinetics. AKT2-transformed mesophyll cells, displayed inward-rectifying, rather than voltage-independent K+ channels, initially characterised in AKT2-expressing animal cells. In contrast, AtTPK4 showed the same electrophysiological characteristics both, in oocytes and plant cells. Our data suggest that heterologous systems do not always possess all regulatory components for functional expression of plant channels. Therefore, transient expression of plant proteins in planta provides an additional research tool for rapid biophysical analysis of plant ion channels.

22947504|t|Direct glutathione quantification in human blood by LC-MS/MS: comparison with HPLC with electrochemical detection.
22947504|a|Glutathione plays a central role in the defence against oxidative damage and in signaling pathways. Upon oxidation the reduced glutathione (GSH) is transformed to glutathione disulfide (GSSG). The concentration of GSH and GSSG in whole blood samples and their ratios is useful indicator of the oxidative stress status and/or disease risk. Here we describe a liquid-chromatographic method coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and we present the results of its comparison with a high-performance liquid-chromatographic method with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD). The method performed well in terms of validation parameters, i.e. linear range (0.01-50μM for both GSH and GSSG), precision (intra- and inter-day coefficients of variation were less than 10% for both GSH and GSSG), accuracy (bias% varied between -2.1 and 7.9% for both analytes), quantification limits (LLOQs were 0.5μM and 0.0625μM for GSH and GSSG respectively). Furthermore the LC-MS/MS method showed a good agreement with the HPLC-ECD assay. However, major benefits of LC-MS/MS are the improved selectivity, precision and accuracy, the higher sensitivity and the unaltered capacity of detection with time in contrast to ECD.

15698453|t|Pretreatment serum FGF-23 levels predict the efficacy of calcitriol therapy in dialysis patients.
15698453|a|BACKGROUND: The predictor for the result of calcitriol therapy would be useful in the clinical practice of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) is a newly found circulating phosphaturic factor. Its circulating level is elevated in uremia. METHODS: Dialysis patients with plasma intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels greater than 300 pg/mL were included in the study. Calcitriol was intravenously injected three times a week. The patients whose plasma iPTH levels dropped below 300 pg/mL within 24 weeks were defined as those who had been successfully treated. A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system that detects human FGF-23 was applied. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were analyzed. The pretreatment FGF-23 levels were related to the iPTH levels, calcium x phosphate product levels, and history of active vitamin D therapy. The pretreatment FGF-23, iPTH, and calcium levels were lower in the patients who would be successfully treated with calcitriol. A logistic regression study revealed that the pretreatment iPTH and FGF-23 levels significantly affected the therapy results. Analyses using a receiver-operated curve revealed that FGF-23 was the best screening test for identifying patients with future refractory response to calcitriol therapy. The treatment would be successful in 88.2% of those with FGF-23 </=9860 ng/L and iPTH </=591 pg/mL, while it would be successful in only 4.2% of those with FGF-23 >9860 ng/L and iPTH >591 pg/mL. CONCLUSION: Pretreatment serum FGF-23 levels were a good indicator in predicting the response to calcitriol therapy. The measurement of serum FGF-23 levels, especially in combination with iPTH levels, is a promising laboratory examination for the clinical practice of secondary hyperparathyroidism.

28260075|t|Protective effect of mitochondria‑targeted peptide MTP‑131 against oxidative stress‑induced apoptosis in RGC‑5 cells.
28260075|a|The retina of the human eye is extremely vulnerable to oxidative damage. Previous studies have demonstrated that oxidative stress is the predominant mechanism associated with the pathogenesis of age‑related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and retinitis pigmentosa. MTP‑131, a novel mitochondria‑targeted peptide, has been demonstrated to specifically concentrate in the inner mitochondria membrane and to exhibit remarkable antioxidant effects both in vitro and in animal models. In the present study, the protective effect of MTP‑131 was evaluated in response to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)‑induced oxidative damage in a retinal ganglion cell line, RGC‑5. Cell viability was measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. Changes of mitochondrial membrane potential and generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, respectively. Annexin V‑fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide staining was used for assessment of apoptosis. Release of cytochrome c was analyzed by confocal microscopy. Pretreatment of cells with MTP‑131 inhibited H2O2‑induced cytotoxicity and reduced LDH release in a dose‑dependent manner, compared with cells treated with H2O2 alone. Mitochondrial depolarization and ROS generation were also prevented by MTP‑131 pretreatment. In addition, MTP‑131 pretreatment inhibited cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytoplasm, and significantly reduced apoptosis in RGC‑5 cells, compared with cells treated with H2O2 alone. In conclusion, mitochondria‑targeted peptide MTP‑131 exhibited a protective effect against oxidative stress‑induced apoptosis in RGC‑5 cells, which may provide a novel approach for the treatment of age‑associated retinal diseases.

8978672|t|Kes1p shares homology with human oxysterol binding protein and participates in a novel regulatory pathway for yeast Golgi-derived transport vesicle biogenesis.
8978672|a|The yeast phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (Sec14p) is required for biogenesis of Golgi-derived transport vesicles and cell viability, and this essential Sec14p requirement is abrogated by inactivation of the CDP-choline pathway for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. These findings indicate that Sec14p functions to alleviate a CDP-choline pathway-mediated toxicity to yeast Golgi secretory function. We now report that this toxicity is manifested through the action of yeast Kes1p, a polypeptide that shares homology with the ligand-binding domain of human oxysterol binding protein (OSBP). Identification of Kes1p as a negative effector for Golgi function provides the first direct insight into the biological role of any member of the OSBP family, and describes a novel pathway for the regulation of Golgi-derived transport vesicle biogenesis.

12782308|t|Saccharomyces cerevisiae 14-3-3 proteins Bmh1 and Bmh2 participate in the process of catabolite inactivation of maltose permease.
12782308|a|In this study we show that Reg1, the regulatory subunit of the Reg1/Glc7 protein phosphatase (PP1) complex, interacts physically with the two yeast members of the 14-3-3 protein family, Bmh1 and Bmh2. By using different fragments of the Reg1 protein we mapped the interaction domain at the N-terminal part of the protein. We also show that Reg1 and yeast 14-3-3 proteins participate actively in the regulation of the glucose-induced degradation of maltose permease (Mal61).

21755532|t|Identification of regulatory elements in the AGT1 promoter of ale and lager strains of brewer's yeast.
21755532|a|Agt1 is an interesting α-glucoside transporter for the brewing industry, as it efficiently transports maltotriose, a sugar often remaining partly unused during beer fermentation. It has been shown that on maltose the expression level of AGT1 is much higher in ale strains than in lager strains, and that glucose represses the expression, particularly in the ale strains. In the present study the regulatory elements of the AGT1 promoter of one ale and two lager strains were identified by computational methods. Promoter regions up to 1.9 kbp upstream of the AGT1 gene were sequenced from the three brewer's yeast strains and the laboratory yeast strain CEN.PK-1D. The promoter sequence of the laboratory strain was identical to the AGT1 promoter of strain S288c of the Saccharomyces Genome Database, whereas the promoter sequences of the industrial strains diverged markedly from the S288c strain. The AGT1 promoter regions of the ale and lager strains were for the most part identical to each other, except for one 22 bp deletion and two 94 and 95 bp insertions in the ale strain. Computational analyses of promoter elements revealed that the promoter sequences contained several Mig1- and MAL-activator binding sites, as was expected. However, some of the Mig1 and MAL-activator binding sites were located on the two insertions of the ale strain, and thus offered a plausible explanation for the different expression pattern of the AGT1 gene in the ale strains. Accordingly, functional analysis of A60 ale and A15 lager strain AGT1 promoters fused to GFP (encoding the green fluorescent protein) showed a significant difference in the ability of these two promoters to drive GFP expression. Under the control of the AGT1 promoter of the ale strain the emergence of GFP was strongly induced by maltose, whereas only a low level of GFP was detected with the construct carrying the AGT1 promoter of the lager strain. Thus, the extra MAL-activator binding element, present in the AGT1 promoter of the ale strain, appears to be necessary to reach a high level of induction by maltose. Both AGT1 promoters were repressed by glucose but their derepression was different, possibly due to a distinct distribution of Mig1 elements in these two promoters.

26657712|t|Does Aldosterone Play a Significant Role for Regulation of Vascular Tone?
26657712|a|Besides the well-known renal effects of aldosterone, the hormone is now known to have direct vascular effects. Clinical observations underline substantial adverse effects of aldosterone on cardiovascular function. The source of systemic circulating aldosterone is the adrenal gland zona glomerulosa cells through stimulus-secretion coupling involving depolarization, opening of L- and T-type calcium channels and aldosterone synthase activation. Local formation and release in peripheral tissues such as perivascular fat is recognized. Where does aldosterone affect the vasculature? Mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) are present in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, and MR-independent pathways are also involved. The vascular effects of aldosterone are complex, both concentration and temporal and spatial aspects are relevant. The acute response includes vasodilation through endothelial nitric oxide formation and vasoconstrictor effects through endothelial-contracting cyclooxygenase-derived factors and a changed calcium handling. The response to aldosterone can change within the same blood vessels depending on the exposure time and status of the endothelium. Chronic responses involve changed levels of reactive oxygen radicals, endothelial Na-influx and smooth muscle calcium channel expression. Furthermore, perivascular cells for example mast cells have also been suggested to participate in the chronic response. Moreover, the vascular effect of aldosterone depends on the status of the endothelium which is likely the cause of the very different responses to aldosterone and MR treatment observed in human studies going from increased to decreased flow depending on whether the patient had prior cardiovascular disease with endothelial dysfunction or not. A preponderance of constrictor versus dilator responses to aldosterone could therefore be involved in the detrimental vascular actions of the hormone in the setting of endothelial dysfunction and contribute to explain the beneficial action of MR blockers on blood pressure and target organ injury.

23868757|t|Riboflavin depletion of intestinal cells in vitro leads to impaired energy generation and enhanced oxidative stress.
23868757|a|BACKGROUND: Riboflavin is an essential component of the human diet, with an established role for its derivative cofactors in oxidative metabolism. Our previous in vivo data suggest that riboflavin may act as a signalling molecule in the intestinal lumen, regulating crypt development and cell turnover. Our in vitro studies in riboflavin-depleted intestinal cells in culture indicate that riboflavin depletion impairs normal mitosis. METHODS: The aim of the study was to establish an improved intestinal cell model of riboflavin depletion using the structural analogue of riboflavin, lumiflavin (7,8,10-trimethyl-isoalloxazine) and to determine effects on cell function. The study was conducted using three intestinal cell lines, Caco-2, HCT116 and HT29 cells. RESULTS: Cell growth was inhibited in all three cell lines, in a lumiflavin concentration-dependent manner. Riboflavin depletion was confirmed through a significant decrease in intracellular riboflavin concentrations in Caco-2 and HT29 cell lines and a significant increase in the activation coefficient for the flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent enzyme glutathione reductase. Riboflavin depletion led to a significant reduction in intracellular ATP concentration, and an enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species was also observed in response to riboflavin depletion, in all cell lines; effects were at least fivefold greater in Caco-2 cells than other cells. Riboflavin-depleted Caco-2 and HCT116 cells also showed an irreversible loss of proliferative potential. CONCLUSIONS: A model system of intracellular riboflavin depletion in intestinal epithelial cells has been developed. Riboflavin depletion induced by lumiflavin results in oxidative stress and a disruption of energy generation, which may contribute to observed effects on cell proliferation.

12163035|t|Detection of site-specific proteolysis in secretory pathways.
12163035|a|We report here a genetic assay suitable for detecting site-specific proteolysis in secretory pathways. The yeast enzyme invertase is linked to the truncated lumenal region of the yeast Golgi membrane protein STE13 via a protease substrate domain in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain lacking invertase. When the substrate is cleaved by a specific protease, the invertase moiety is released into the periplasmic space where it degrades sucrose to glucose and fructose. Therefore, site-specific proteolysis can be detected by monitoring the growth of yeast cells on selective media containing sucrose as the sole carbon source. We confirmed the validity of this assay with yeast Kex2 and human TMPRSS2 proteases. Our data suggest that this in vivo assay is an efficient method for the determination of substrate specificity and mutational analysis of secreted or membrane proteases.

9051712|t|Effect of Serenoa repens extract (Permixon) on estradiol/testosterone-induced experimental prostate enlargement in the rat.
9051712|a|The effect of the lipidosterolic extract of Serenoa repens (LSESR) on experimental prostate enlargement was investigated in three groups of rats: shams treated with LSESR (sham rats), castrated animals treated with estradiol and testosterone (castrated rats), castrated animals treated with estradiol/testosterone and treated with LSESR (castrated and treated rats). Following three months of continuous hormonal treatment, the weight of prostates in estradiol/testosterone-treated castrated rats was significantly increased in comparison with sham-operated rats. Such an increase started rapidly, reached a maximum by 30 days and remained at a plateau or slightly declined thereafter. The increase of prostate total weight induced by the hormone treatment was inhibited by administration of LSESR. Indeed, the weight was significantly lower at day 60 and day 90 for the dorsal and lateral regions of the prostate. The weight of the ventral region of the prostate was significantly lower after 30 and 60 days treatment with LSESR. These results demonstrate that administering LSESR to hormone-treated castrated rats inhibits the increase in prostate wet weight. This effect of LSESR may explain the beneficial effect of this extract in human benign prostatic hypertrophy.

7834352|t|Regional alteration of cholinergic function in central neurons of trisomy 16 mouse fetuses, an animal model of human trisomy 21 (Down syndrome).
7834352|a|The trisomy-16 (TS16) mouse is considered to be a model of human trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) because of genetic homology between mouse chromosome 16 and human chromosome 21. We examined cholinergic function of brain and spinal cord tissue and in cultured neurons from TS16 mouse compared with that of age matched controls. Mean acetylcholinesterase activity in both tissue types did not differ between trisomic and control conditions. Acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis, measured as choline O-acetyltratransferase (acetyl-CoA) activity, was reduced to 67% of control in TS16 brain but not in TS16 spinal cord. Steady-state accumulation of ACh precursor, [3H]choline, was measured in primary cell cultures. Steady-state choline uptake was reduced to 35% and to 61% in neurons of TS16 brain and spinal cord, respectively, when compared with controls. Kinetics experiments in TS16 brain cells showed a 50% reduction of the maximal velocity of choline uptake when compared to controls. Further, the ACh release induced by KCl depolarization in TS16 spinal cord neurons did not differ from control neurons but was reduced in TS16 brain neurons. This effect cannot be explained solely by a reduction in ACh synthesis. The results indicate that the TS16 condition in mice significantly modified the cholinergic function in brain, and to a lesser degree in spinal cord, suggesting that the higher gene dosage inherent to the trisomic condition affects cholinergic neurons in different regions of the central nervous system in a differential fashion.

19709638|t|In vivo transungual iontophoresis: effect of DC current application on ionic transport and on transonychial water loss.
19709638|a|The potential use of iontophoresis to improve drug penetration into the nail has been suggested. However, there is little information concerning transungual iontophoresis in vivo. This work describes the application of transungual iontophoresis to six healthy human volunteers in order to investigate key issues such as the effect of current application on ionic transport and on transonychial water loss (TOWL), and the magnitude of the voltages required for a practical use of the technique. Each volunteer participated in three experiments: passive control, 0.2 mA anodal transungual iontophoresis and 0.2 mA cathodal transungual iontophoresis. A commercial electrode on a skin site was used to complete the electrical circuit. The outward transungual extraction of sodium and chloride ions by passive diffusion and iontophoresis was quantified. Iontophoresis enhanced chloride and sodium transport approximately 8 and 27 fold respectively compared to passive diffusion. Sodium transport numbers were measured to be t(Na+)=0.51+/-0.11. TOWL was used as a potential marker of nail damage and hydration. Basal TOWL was measured before each experiment, and the return to baseline values was monitored for 1h after the treatment (passive or iontophoresis application) was finished. TOWL was increased after both iontophoretic and passive experiments and typically returned to baseline values in 1h post-treatment. The voltage of the nail-to-skin circuit was monitored during iontophoresis and compared to those observed in a skin-to-skin circuit. Nail-to-skin circuit voltages were generally approximately 50 V when the current was started and dropped fast to 20-30 V, a value comparable to that observed in the skin-to-skin circuit. On the whole, the clear enhancement of ionic transport observed, the feedback from volunteers, the small effects in TOWL, and the magnitude of voltages indicate that nail DC current iontophoresis is feasible and probably a safe technique.

2163367|t|Effect of sodium azide on hydrogen peroxide production by zymosan-activated human neutrophils.
2163367|a|Stimulated neutrophils (PMNs) produce large quantities of superoxide anion, which is the precursor for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). We developed a new fluorimetric assay to measure the H2O2 released by zymosan A-activated PMNs utilizing the oxidation of p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid by H2O2 to its fluorescent dimer in the presence of horseradish peroxidase. Zymosan-activated PMNs isolated from nine healthy volunteers and 20 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) released after 90 min 2.3 +/- 0.3 and 2.4 +/- 1.3 nmol H2O2/10(6) PMNs, respectively. Inhibition of the heme enzymes by 1.0 mM sodium azide (NaN3) increased the H2O2 production to 21.6 +/- 4.4 nmol H2O2/10(6) PMNs in the control group (P less than 0.001), and to 22.5 +/- 14.7 nmol H2O2/10(6) PMNs in patients with AHRF (P less than 0.001). Incubation temperature, room temperature or 37 degrees C, did not change the total amount of H2O2 produced after 90 min by zymosan-activated PMN. Addition of NaN3 improved both the sensitivity and reproducibility of the measurement of H2O2 and allowed detection of H2O2 released by PMNs with coefficients of variation of less than 5% at PMN concentrations as low as 0.1 x 10(6) cells/ml. The amount of H2O2 released by activated PMNs did not distinguish healthy controls from patients with AHRF.

9359864|t|The sphingomyelin-ceramide pathway participates in cytokine regulation of C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A, but not alpha-fibrinogen.
9359864|a|Maximal induction of the acute-phase proteins C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) in the human hepatoma cell line Hep3B requires the combination of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1. In contrast, IL-1 inhibits fibrinogen induction by IL-6. To explore the possible participation of the sphingomyelin-ceramide pathway in the transduction of cytokine effects, the role of this pathway in expression of CRP, SAA and alpha-fibrinogen was investigated. The cell-permeable ceramide analogues C2 and C6 each greatly potentiated induction of both CRP and SAA mRNA by IL-6+IL-1beta but did not affect the responses of alpha-fibrinogen to IL-6 or to IL-6+IL-1beta. The combination of IL-6+IL-1beta led to increased turnover of sphingomyelin in Hep3B cells. D609, an inhibitor of ceramide production by acidic but not neutral sphingomyelinases, substantially inhibited induction of CRP and SAA by IL-6+IL-1beta. The ability of C2 and C6 to potentiate the effects of cytokines suggests that the sphingomyelin-ceramide pathway participates in induction of CRP and SAA by IL-6+IL-1beta under these experimental conditions, most likely by transducing the effects of IL-1beta. C2 and C6 were unable to substitute for IL-1beta in enhancing IL-6 effects on CRP and SAA, consistent with other reports indicating that the sphingomyelin-ceramide pathway is only a single component of multiple necessary converging pathways for induction of many genes. In contrast, this pathway does not appear to participate in mediating the inhibitory effects of IL-1beta on fibrinogen induction by IL-6.

12473376|t|Potent inhibitory effect of naturally occurring flavonoids quercetin and kaempferol on in vitro osteoclastic bone resorption.
12473376|a|Several recent studies have suggested that flavonols, a class of phytochemicals with many biological activities, might exert a protective effect against post-menopausal bone loss. In the present study, we investigated the effects of quercetin and kaempferol, two of the major naturally occurring flavonols on the in vitro bone resorbing activity of osteoclasts. Our results indicate that both compounds, at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 microM reduce bone resorption in a time and dose-dependent manner. Significant inhibitory effects were observed at concentrations as low as 0.1 microM especially with kaempferol. The IC(50)s, or concentration inhibitory of 50% of basal resorption, calculated for quercetin and kaempferol were 1.6 and 5.3 microM, respectively. Using highly purified rabbit osteoclasts, we showed that both flavonols directly induce apoptosis of mature osteoclasts in the same dose-range effective for inhibiting bone resorption. When osteoclasts were treated with 50 microM of quercetin and kaempferol, intracellular reactive oxygen species levels decreased significantly by 75 and 25%, respectively, indicating these molecules keep their antioxidant properties at this concentration. However, at concentrations below 50 microM, neither quercetin nor kaempferol exerted antiradical action, suggesting that antioxidant properties cannot fully explain the inhibitory effect on bone resorption. Finally, we report that kaempferol-, but not the quercetin-induced inhibition of bone resorption was partially abolished by the presence of the pure anti-estrogen ICI 182780 suggesting that kaempferol's estrogenic effect could be involved in the inhibition of bone resorption. The present study demonstrates that flavonols widely distributed in human diet such as quercetin and kaempferol, exert a potent inhibitory effect on in vitro bone resorption.

26370253|t|Soil N retention and nitrate leaching in three types of dunes in the Mu Us desert of China.
26370253|a|A large reservoir of soil nitrate in desert subsoil zones has been demonstrated in previous studies; however, information on the subsoil nitrate reservoir and its distribution characteristics in the deserts of China is still limited. This study investigated the distribution patterns of soil total nitrogen (N), nitrate, ammonium, and stable isotopic ratios of (15)N (δ(15)N) in shallow (1 m) and subsoil (5 m) profiles in three types of dunes in the Mu Us desert of China. We found that soil N retention of the fixed and semi-fixed dunes followed a progressive nutrient depletion pattern in shallow soil profiles, whereas the subsoil nitrate of the fixed, semi-fixed and mobile dunes maintained a conservative accumulation pattern. The results indicate that the subsoil of the Mu Us desert may act as a reservoir of available nitrate. Furthermore, a soil δ(15)N analysis indicate that the nitrate content of the fixed dune is likely derived from soil nitrification, whereas the nitrate content in the mobile dune is derived from atmospheric nitrate deposition. Within the context of looming climate change and intensifying human activities, the subsoil nitrate content in the deserts of northern China could become mobilized and increase environmental risks to groundwater.

7544877|t|Hormonal regulation of human follicle-stimulating hormone-beta subunit gene expression: GnRH stimulation and GnRH-independent androgen inhibition.
7544877|a|Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that chronic testosterone administration to castrated transgenic mice suppressed human follicle-stimulating hormone-beta (FSH beta) mRNA levels transcribed from a human transgene to approximately 20% of control values. In the present study we used primary pituitary cultures prepared from the transgenic mice and in vivo experiments in hypogonadal (hpg) mice carrying the human transgene to assess the role of hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in this inhibitory action. The levels of human FSH beta mRNA in monolayer cultures of pituitary cells were decreased by 24-hour treatments with 10 nM testosterone propionate or 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone to 13 and 26% of control values, respectively, in the absence of GnRH. For the in vivo experiments we introduced the 10-kb human FSH beta transgene into the hpg genetic background by selective crossbreeding. Daily injections of 1 microgram GnRH for 14 days induced expression of the human FSH beta gene in male and female mice. Maximal effects were obtained by GnRH treatment of gonadectomized, hpg transgenic mice. Human FSH beta mRNA levels rose to approximately 4- or 10-fold that of control males and females, respectively. The stimulation was blocked completely by simultaneous administration of testosterone propionate in males and partially by estradiol in females. Pituitary content of immunoreactive FSH paralleled the mRNA changes. These data suggest that testosterone feedback inhibits the human FSH beta subunit gene directly at the pituitary gland in addition to the indirect mechanism of GnRH suppression. Furthermore, the in vitro data indicate that the suppression of human FSH beta gene expression is at least partly a direct androgen effect that does not require aromatization of testosterone to estradiol.

3017576|t|Effect of interferon-gamma and 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 on superoxide anion, prostaglandins E2, and mononuclear cell factor production by U937 cells.
3017576|a|Both interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1 alpha,25(OH)2D3) induce changes in the human monocytic cell line U937 that may reflect cellular differentiation. The effects of recombinant IFN-gamma and 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 on U937 cells with regard to the release of superoxide anion (O2-), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and mononuclear cell factor (MCF) after stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) were examined. PMA did not induce O2- production in untreated cells. A 3-day preincubation with IFN-gamma or 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 resulted in a 5- to 10-fold increase in PMA-stimulated production of O2- as compared to cells preincubated in medium alone. The response was related to IFN-gamma and 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 concentrations. In contrast, the PMA-induced production of PGE2 and MCF does not require preincubation with either IFN-gamma or 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3. These results suggest that O2- production and cytokine production (i.e., PGE2 and MCF) are modulated by different signals related to maturation processes.

25918382|t|Characterizing the in vivo role of trehalose in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using the AGT1 transporter.
25918382|a|Trehalose is a highly stable, nonreducing disaccharide of glucose. A large body of research exists implicating trehalose in a variety of cellular phenomena, notably response to stresses of various kinds. However, in very few cases has the role of trehalose been examined directly in vivo. Here, we describe the development and characterization of a system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that allows us to manipulate intracellular trehalose concentrations independently of the biosynthetic enzymes and independently of any applied stress. We found that many physiological roles heretofore ascribed to intracellular trehalose, including heat resistance, are not due to the presence of trehalose per se. We also found that many of the metabolic and growth defects associated with mutations in the trehalose biosynthesis pathway are not abolished by providing abundant intracellular trehalose. Instead, we made the observation that intracellular accumulation of trehalose or maltose (another disaccharide of glucose) is growth-inhibitory in a carbon source-specific manner. We conclude that the physiological role of the trehalose pathway is fundamentally metabolic: i.e., more complex than simply the consequence of increased concentrations of the sugar and its attendant physical properties (with the exception of the companion paper where Tapia et al. [Tapia H, et al. (2015) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 10.1073/pnas.1506415112] demonstrate a direct role for trehalose in protecting cells against desiccation).

20407216|t|Occupational trichloroethylene hypersensitivity syndrome with human herpesvirus-6 and cytomegalovirus reactivation.
20407216|a|Patients having a generalised rash with severe liver dysfunction associated with exposure to trichloroethylene (TCE) have been reported mainly in Asian countries. However, no case has been reported in Japan since the 1990s. Here, we describe a case of hypersensitivity syndrome (HS) caused by TCE in a 30-year-old Japanese man. The patient developed a rash, fever and liver dysfunction 21 days after he had been exposed to TCE at his workplace. Serum human herpesvirus (HHV)-6 and cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA were detected 4 and 7 weeks, respectively, after the onset; the IgG antibody titres to HHV-6 and CMV were significantly elevated 6 and 9 weeks, respectively, after the onset. Patch testing was positive for the metabolites of TCE (i.e. trichloroethanol, trichloroacetic acid and chloral hydrate) but not for TCE itself; these results suggest that the TCE metabolites induced this disease. Human leucocyte antigen-B*1301, which has been reported to be strongly associated with TCE-induced HS, was identified in this patient. In addition, the clinical findings, laboratory data and period of virus reactivation after onset were quite similar to those of drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). We also review TCE-induced HS from the viewpoint of the similarity to DIHS in this article.

8102402|t|Central activation of autonomic effectors during mental simulation of motor actions in man.
8102402|a|1. Healthy subjects actually performed and mentally simulated a leg exercise at two levels of work (15 and 19 kg loads). Heart rate, respiration rate and end-tidal PCO2 were measured in both conditions. In addition, muscular metabolism was simultaneously measured using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. 2. During actual exercise, heart and respiration rates increased, first abruptly and then gradually in relation to the level of work. End-tidal PCO2 was unaltered. NMR spectra showed a drop in phosphocreatine (PCr) and an increase in inorganic phosphate (Pi) concentrations. Intracellular pH fell to 6.65 at maximal effort with a 19 kg load. 3. During mental simulation, both heart and ventilatory rate increased immediately after mental exercise was begun. This increase was proportional to the amount of simulated exercise. Heart rate remained about 25% below the level observed during actual exercise. The increase in respiration rate, by contrast, was more marked than during actual exercise. Finally, end-tidal PCO2 decreased progressively to about 18% of the resting value. 4. During mental simulation, NMR spectra were unchanged with respect to the resting values. 5. Subjects rated their sensation of fatigue using an analog  rating scale, during both actual exercise and mental simulation. During mental exercise, the sensation of fatigue was greater with the 19 kg load than with the 15 kg load. 6. These results demonstrate that mental simulation of action can activate heart and respiration control mechanisms. They suggest that autonomic activation during imagined action pertains to the more general phenomenon of preparation for action.

16308562|t|Regulation of G0 entry by the Pho80-Pho85 cyclin-CDK complex.
16308562|a|Eukaryotic cell proliferation is controlled by growth factors and essential nutrients. In their absence, cells may enter into a quiescent state (G0). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the conserved protein kinase A (PKA) and rapamycin-sensitive TOR (TORC1) pathways antagonize G0 entry in response to carbon and/or nitrogen availability primarily by inhibiting the PAS kinase Rim15 function. Here, we show that the phosphate-sensing Pho80-Pho85 cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complex also participates in Rim15 inhibition through direct phosphorylation, thereby effectively sequestering Rim15 in the cytoplasm via its association with 14-3-3 proteins. Inactivation of either Pho80-Pho85 or TORC1 causes dephosphorylation of the 14-3-3-binding site in Rim15, thus enabling nuclear import of Rim15 and induction of the Rim15-controlled G0 program. Importantly, we also show that Pho80-Pho85 and TORC1 converge on a single amino acid in Rim15. Thus, Rim15 plays a key role in G0 entry through its ability to integrate signaling from the PKA, TORC1, and Pho80-Pho85 pathways.

25393412|t|Phylogenetically driven sequencing of extremely halophilic archaea reveals strategies for static and dynamic osmo-response.
25393412|a|Organisms across the tree of life use a variety of mechanisms to respond to stress-inducing fluctuations in osmotic conditions. Cellular response mechanisms and phenotypes associated with osmoadaptation also play important roles in bacterial virulence, human health, agricultural production and many other biological systems. To improve understanding of osmoadaptive strategies, we have generated 59 high-quality draft genomes for the haloarchaea (a euryarchaeal clade whose members thrive in hypersaline environments and routinely experience drastic changes in environmental salinity) and analyzed these new genomes in combination with those from 21 previously sequenced haloarchaeal isolates. We propose a generalized model for haloarchaeal management of cytoplasmic osmolarity in response to osmotic shifts, where potassium accumulation and sodium expulsion during osmotic upshock are accomplished via secondary transport using the proton gradient as an energy source, and potassium loss during downshock is via a combination of secondary transport and non-specific ion loss through mechanosensitive channels. We also propose new mechanisms for magnesium and chloride accumulation. We describe the expansion and differentiation of haloarchaeal general transcription factor families, including two novel expansions of the TATA-binding protein family, and discuss their potential for enabling rapid adaptation to environmental fluxes. We challenge a recent high-profile proposal regarding the evolutionary origins of the haloarchaea by showing that inclusion of additional genomes significantly reduces support for a proposed large-scale horizontal gene transfer into the ancestral haloarchaeon from the bacterial domain. The combination of broad (17 genera) and deep (≥5 species in four genera) sampling of a phenotypically unified clade has enabled us to uncover both highly conserved and specialized features of osmoadaptation. Finally, we demonstrate the broad utility of such datasets, for metagenomics, improvements to automated gene annotation and investigations of evolutionary processes.

22046389|t|Aerosolized human extracellular superoxide dismutase prevents hyperoxia-induced lung injury.
22046389|a|An important issue in critical care medicine is the identification of ways to protect the lungs from oxygen toxicity and reduce systemic oxidative stress in conditions requiring mechanical ventilation and high levels of oxygen. One way to prevent oxygen toxicity is to augment antioxidant enzyme activity in the respiratory system. The current study investigated the ability of aerosolized extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) to protect the lungs from hyperoxic injury. Recombinant human EC-SOD (rhEC-SOD) was produced from a synthetic cassette constructed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. Female CD-1 mice were exposed in hyperoxia (FiO2>95%) to induce lung injury. The therapeutic effects of EC-SOD and copper-zinc SOD (CuZn-SOD) via an aerosol delivery system for lung injury and systemic oxidative stress at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h of hyperoxia were measured by bronchoalveolar lavage, wet/dry ratio, lung histology, and 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) in lung and liver tissues. After exposure to hyperoxia, the wet/dry weight ratio remained stable before day 2 but increased significantly after day 3. The levels of oxidative biomarker 8-oxo-dG in the lung and liver were significantly decreased on day 2 (P<0.01) but the marker in the liver increased abruptly after day 3 of hyperoxia when the mortality increased. Treatment with aerosolized rhEC-SOD increased the survival rate at day 3 under hyperoxia to 95.8%, which was significantly higher than that of the control group (57.1%), albumin treated group (33.3%), and CuZn-SOD treated group (75%). The protective effects of EC-SOD against hyperoxia were further confirmed by reduced lung edema and systemic oxidative stress. Aerosolized EC-SOD protected mice against oxygen toxicity and reduced mortality in a hyperoxic model. The results encourage the use of an aerosol therapy with EC-SOD in intensive care units to reduce oxidative injury in patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

11283936|t|Expression and prognostic significance of catalase in malignant mesothelioma.
11283936|a|BACKGROUND: Free radicals and antioxidant enzymes (AOEs) may play a critical role in cell proliferation and in the resistance of malignant cells against cytotoxic drugs and radiation. Malignant mesothelioma is a resistant tumor with high levels of manganese superoxide dismutase, a central superoxide scavenging AOE. In the current study, the authors assessed the expression and prognostic role of catalase, an important hydrogen peroxide scavenging AOE, in malignant pleural mesothelioma. METHODS: Catalase expression was investigated by immunohistochemistry in 5 cases of nonmalignant healthy pleura and in tumor tissue of 32 mesothelioma patients, and by Western blot in 7 continuous human mesothelioma cell lines. The distribution of catalase in mesothelioma cells was assessed by immunoelectron microscopy. Furthermore, to investigate the effect of catalase inhibition in the drug resistance of these cells in vitro, the authors exposed mesothelioma cells with the highest catalase level to epirubicin with and without aminotriazole pretreatment. RESULTS: Nonmalignant mesothelial cells showed no catalase immunoreactivity whereas most mesothelioma cases (24 of 32, 75%) were catalase positive, 17 cases (53%) showing moderate or high expression. Higher catalase expression in mesothelioma was associated with a better prognosis, mean survival rate from diagnosis being 6 and 24 months for negative/low expression and moderate/high expression, respectively. Furthermore, a coordinately high expression of both manganese-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) and catalase predicted even more favorable outcome of the mesothelioma patients. Catalase also could be detected in all mesothelioma cell lines, the most resistant cell line showing the highest protein expression and compartmentalization of catalase mainly to peroxisomes. Aminotriazole inhibition of catalase had a marginal effect on the toxicity caused by epirubicin. CONCLUSIONS: Catalase may have multifactorial effects in malignant cells; high catalase and/or coordinated high expression of Mn-SOD and catalase may decrease tumor progression by modulating the cellular redox state, but enhanced antioxidant capacity of mesothelioma cells also may protect tumor cells against exogenous oxidants, at least in vitro.

20647695|t|Bone morphogenetic protein-7 inhibits vascular calcification induced by high vitamin D in mice.
20647695|a|Vascular calcification refers to the deposition of calcium phosphate in cardiovascular tissues, including arteries and myocardium. Vascular calcification is frequently associated with cardiovascular disease. Recently, bone morphgenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) has been proposed to play an inhibitory role in vascular calcification, but its inhibitory effect has not been fully elucidated. We therefore tested the hypothesis that BMP-7 inhibits vascular calcification by using two conditions, high levels of vitamin D and phosphate, each of which could enhance vascular calcification. C57BL/6 mice were treated for 3 days with high vitamin D (500,000 IU/kg/day) in the presence or absence of recombinant human BMP-7 (rhBMP-7). Expression levels of osteopontin and osteocalcin, markers of the osteoblastic phenotype, were assessed by immunohistochemical staining or Western blotting analysis. Vitamin D increased calcium staining in thoracic aortas and hearts and the expression levels of osteopontin and osteocalcin in mice. Importantly, pretreatment for 7 days and subsequent treatment for 3 days with rhBMP-7 (10 microg/kg/day) abolished the vitamin D-mediated increases in the above parameters. In addition, human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) were cultured with high beta-glycerophosphate, a phosphate donor, for 2 weeks in the presence or absence of rhBMP-7. High beta-glycerophosphate increased expression levels of osteopontin and osteocalcin as well as calcium staining in HASMCs, but these changes were attenuated by treatment with BMP-7. Thus, BMP-7 inhibits vascular calcification associated with high levels of vitamin D or phosphate. We propose that BMP-7 treatment may be helpful in reducing the risks of cardiovascular disease related to vascular calcification.

12771308|t|Molecular targets of hyperphosphataemia in chronic renal failure.
12771308|a|Dietary phosphate restriction can prevent or retard the progress of chronic renal failure (CRF) and secondary hyperparathyroidism. The klotho gene is involved in the development of a syndrome resembling human ageing, and klotho mutant mice show abnormal calcium/vitamin D metabolism, developing hyperphosphataemia and vascular calcification. Phosphate retention rescues the phenotype of klotho mice. The level of expression of klotho RNA was greatly reduced in the kidneys of all CRF patients. Dietary P(i) restriction induced klotho expression, which enhances the beneficial effect of P(i) restriction in patients with CRF and/or on haemodialysis.

10564760|t|Cytotoxicity, redox cycling and photodynamic action of two naturally occurring quinones.
10564760|a|Two naturally occurring anthraquinones, barleriaquinone-I (BQ-I) and barleriaquinone-II (BQ-II), extracted from Barleria buxifolia, are tested for their cytotoxic action by aerobic incubation with human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF7). Cytotoxicities, measured as LD(50) (50% inhibition of colony formation) values, show BQ-II to be more active than BQ-I. Electron paramagnetic resonance studies confirm that BQ-II is reductively activated by NADH:cytochrome c reductase to superoxide anion radical. Cyclic voltammetric studies show one quasi-reversible redox couple for both BQ-I and BQ-II. Also, aerobic solutions of both BQ-I and BQ-II on visible illumination generate reactive oxygen species. Formation of O*-2 is studied by both EPR spin trapping and SOD-inhibitable cytochrome c reduction techniques. BQ-I generates more singlet oxygen as evidenced from the photobleaching of N,N-dimethyl-4-nitrosoaniline.

21087789|t|The incorporation of casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate into a glass ionomer cement.
21087789|a|OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to measure the effect of incorporating CPP-ACP into an autocure GIC on physical and mechanical properties, ion release and enamel demineralization inhibition. METHODS: Physical and mechanical properties were evaluated using tests specified by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Concentrations of fluoride, calcium and inorganic phosphate in deionized water (pH 6.9) and lactic acid (pH 4.8) were measured up to five months. Cavities on human extracted molars were prepared, restored with GIC (control), CPP-ACP modified GIC or resin composite, then stored in 50mM lactic acid solution at pH 4.8 for 4 days. Sections of demineralized enamel were examined using polarized light microscopy followed by lesion area measurement. RESULTS: The incorporation of up to 5% CPP-ACP into Fuji VII decreased the cements' strength and prolonged setting time. However, values remained within ISO limits. The incorporation of 3 or 5% CPP-ACP significantly decreased fluoride release, while higher calcium and inorganic phosphate release occurred. The demineralized enamel area adjacent to GIC with 3 or 5% CPP-ACP was significantly smaller compared to GIC control. SIGNIFICANCE: The incorporation of 3% CPP-ACP into GIC has the potential to improve its anticariogenic ability without adversely affecting its mechanical properties.

23865430|t|Halitosis vaccines targeting FomA, a biofilm-bridging protein of fusobacteria nucleatum.
23865430|a|Halitosis (bad breath) is estimated to influence more than half of the world's population with varying degree of intensity. More than 85% of halitosis originates from oral bacterial infections. Foul-smelling breath mainly results from bacterial production of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) such as hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan. To date, major treatments for elimination of oral malodor include periodontal therapy combined with antibiotics or antimicrobial agents, and mechanical approaches including tooth and tongue cleaning. These treatments may transiently reduce VSCs but carry risks of generating toxicity, increasing resistant strains and misbalancing the resident human flora. Therefore, there is a need to develop alternative therapeutic modalities for halitosis. Plaque biofilms are the principal source for generating VSCs which are originally metabolized from amino acids during co-aggregation of oral bacteria. Blocking the bacterial coaggregation, therefore, may prevent various biofilm-associated oral diseases such as periodontitis and halitosis. Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum), a Gram-negative anaerobe oral bacterium, is a main bacterial strain related to halitosis. Aggregation of F. nucleatum with other bacteria to form plaque biofilms in oral cavity causes bad breath. FomA, the major outer membrane protein of F. nucleatum, recruits other oral pathogenic bacteria such as Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) in the periodontal pockets. A halitosis vaccine targeting F. bacterium FomA significantly abrogates the enhancement of bacterial co-aggregation, biofilms, production of VSCs, and gum inflammation mediated by an inter-species interaction of F. nucleatum with P. gingivalis, which suggests FomA of F. nucleatum to be a potential target for development of vaccines or drugs against bacterial biofilm formation and its associated pathogenicities.

The polyamine spermine did not affect PI hydrolysis in the absence of 1S,3R-ACPD even at a concentration of 1 mM, but it potentiated the stimulatory action of 1S,3R-ACPD at 10 microM. The modulatory action of spermine was mimicked by spermidine but not by the short polyamine putrescine.

19298244|t|Peroxiredoxin I is overexpressed in oncocytic lesions of salivary glands.
19298244|a|BACKGROUND: Oncocytic lesions, particularly frequent in the salivary glands, are characterized by cells with an atypical accumulation of mitochondria. This accumulation has been recognized as a compensatory mechanism to intrinsic functional defects of these organelles, resulting in energy production impairment and increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). Peroxiredoxin I (Prx I) is a H(2)O(2) scavenging protein and the expression of its yeast homolog was reported to be influenced by mitochondrial function. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated Prx I expression in oncocytic lesions of salivary glands by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Our results showed that Prx I is overexpressed in oncocytes regardless of the salivary gland lesion where they appear. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Prx I expression in oncocytes is related to its ability to decompose mitochondrial-derived H(2)O(2) and that it could provide to the cells a protective role in an environment that, by continuously producing potential DNA-damaging ROS, predisposes to genome instability and cellular transformation.

11522454|t|Formation of nanomolar concentrations of S-nitroso-albumin in human plasma by nitric oxide.
11522454|a|S-Nitrosothiols are potentially important mediators of biological processes including vascular function, apoptosis, and thrombosis. Recent studies indicate that the concentrations of S-nitrosothiols in the plasma from healthy individuals are lower than previously reported and in the range of 30-120 nM. The mechanisms of formation and metabolism of these low nM concentrations, capable of exerting biological effects, remain unknown. An important issue that remains unresolved is the significance of the reactions of low fluxes of nitric oxide (NO) with oxygen to form S-nitrosothiols in a complex biological medium such as plasma, and the impact of red blood cells on the formation of S-nitrosothiols in blood. These issues were addressed by exposing plasma to varying fluxes of NO and measuring the net formation of S-nitrosothiols. In the presence of oxygen and physiological fluxes of NO, the predominant S-nitrosothiol formed is S-nitroso-albumin at concentrations in the high nM range (approximately 400-1000 nM). Although the formation of S-nitrosothiols by NO was attenuated in whole blood, presumably by erythrocytic hemoglobin, significant amounts of S-nitrosothiols within the physiological range of S-nitrosothiol concentrations (approximately 80 nM) were still formed at physiological fluxes of NO. Little is known about the stability of S-nitroso-albumin in plasma, and this is central to our understanding of the biological effectiveness of S-nitrosothiols. Low molecular weight thiols decreased the half-life of S-nitroso-albumin in plasma, and the stability of S-nitroso-albumin is enhanced by the alkylation of free thiols. Our data suggests that physiologically relevant concentrations of S-nitrosothiols can be formed in blood through the reaction of NO with oxygen and proteins, despite the low rates of reaction of oxygen with NO and the presence of erythrocytes.

23245957|t|Effects of different fermentation parameters on quality characteristics of kefir.
23245957|a|The main objective of the study was to determine the effects of different fermentation parameters on kefir quality. Kefir samples were produced using kefir grains or natural kefir starter culture, and fermentation was carried out under normal or modified atmosphere (10% CO(2)) conditions. The microbiological (lactobacilli, lactococci, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium spp., and yeasts), chemical (pH, lactic acid, total solids, protein, ethanol, exopolysaccharide contents), rheological, and sensory properties of kefir samples were investigated during a 21-d storage period. The use of different fermentation parameters or the choice of grain versus natural kefir starter culture did not significantly affect the content of microorganisms. Lactobacilli, lactococci, and yeast contents of kefir samples varied between 9.21 and 9.28, 9.23 and 9.29, and 4.71 and 5.53 log cfu/mL, respectively, on d 1 of storage. Contents of L. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium spp. were between 5.78 and 6.43 and between 3.19 and 6.14 log cfu/mL, respectively, during 21 d of storage. During the storage period, pH, lactic acid (%), total solids (%), protein (%), acetaldehyde, and ethanol contents of kefir samples ranged from 4.29 to 4.53, from 0.81 to 0.95%, from 7.81 to 8.21%, from 3.09 to 3.48%, from 3.8 to 23.6 mg/L, and from 76.5 to 5,147 mg/L, respectively. The exopolysaccharide contents of the samples decreased during 21 d of cold storage; the samples fermented under modified atmosphere had relatively higher exopolysaccharide contents, indicating higher potential therapeutic properties. The kefir samples exhibited non-Newtonian pseudoplastic flow behavior according to the power law model. According to the sensory results, kefir produced from natural kefir starter culture under CO(2) atmosphere had the highest overall evaluation score at d 1.

3717610|t|[Change in sodium and potassium concentration in human seminal plasma infected experimentally with Ureaplasma urealyticum].
3717610|a|The concentration of sodium and potassium ions was measured by flame photometry in human seminal plasma and human sperm cells as well as in a sperm cell suspension infected experimentally with Ureaplasma urealyticum during incubation as long as 22 hours. The sodium concentration is 86.2 +/- 21.97 mmol/l cells in sperm cells and 120.8 +/- 15.87 mM in seminal plasma. The potassium concentration is 33.2 +/- 16.35 mmol/l cells in sperm cells and 26.7 +/- 4.92 mM in seminal plasma. The sodium concentration decreased considerably in the suspension medium of sperm cells during the first hour of incubation and increased again subsequently. The potassium concentration in the suspension medium changed only little. The sodium concentration in the infected sperm cell suspension was insignificantly increased compared with the mycoplasma-free controls. The potassium concentration was slightly higher in the infected specimens than in the controls. There was no mycoplasma-induced effect on the concentration of sodium and potassium in the sperm suspension after experimental infection.

7682188|t|Characterization of cAMP dependent CFTR-chloride channels in human tracheal gland cells.
7682188|a|Human tracheal gland cells are believed to be a major site at the origin of cystic fibrosis. Since this disease is due to mutations in a protein called CFTR, we looked for the activity of CFTR in human tracheal gland cells in culture. We have identified CFTR-like chloride-selective channels as having a linear current voltage relationship and unitary conductance of 7 pS in these cells. In cell-attached patches, theophylline (1 mM), IBMX (1 mM), or a cocktail of dibutyryl cAMP (1 mM) and IBMX (0.1 mM) promoted the opening of channels. The unitary current had a reversal potential close to the cell resting potential. Replacement of choline by K+ or Na+ in the pipette solution was without effect on the current-voltage relationship, the reversal potential or the unitary conductance, which is consistent with the chloride selectivity of the channel. Channels were always found clustered and their opening probability was not noticeably dependent on membrane potential. This work therefore represents the first observation of a CFTR-like channel activity in submucosal gland cells.

10329683|t|hSK4/hIK1, a calmodulin-binding KCa channel in human T lymphocytes. Roles in proliferation and volume regulation.
10329683|a|Human T lymphocytes express a Ca2+-activated K+ current (IK), whose roles and regulation are poorly understood. We amplified hSK4 cDNA from human T lymphoblasts, and we showed that its biophysical and pharmacological properties when stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells were essentially identical to the native IK current. In activated lymphoblasts, hSK4 mRNA increased 14.6-fold (Kv1.3 mRNA increased 1.3-fold), with functional consequences. Proliferation was inhibited when Kv1.3 and IK were blocked in naive T cells, but IK block alone inhibited re-stimulated lymphoblasts. IK and Kv1.3 were involved in volume regulation, but IK was more important, particularly in lymphoblasts. hSK4 lacks known Ca2+-binding sites; however, we mapped a Ca2+-dependent calmodulin (CaM)-binding site to the proximal C terminus (Ct1) of hSK4. Full-length hSK4 produced a highly negative membrane potential (Vm) in Chinese hamster ovary cells, whereas the channels did not function when either Ct1 or the distal C terminus was deleted (Vm approximately 0 mV). Native IK (but not expressed hSK4) current was inhibited by CaM and CaM kinase antagonists at physiological Vm values, suggesting modulation by an accessory molecule in native cells. Our results provide evidence for increased roles for IK/hSK4 in activated T cell functions; thus hSK4 may be a promising therapeutic target for disorders involving the secondary immune response.

22987314|t|Preserving the morphology and evaluating the quality of liver grafts by hypothermic machine perfusion: a proof-of-concept study using discarded human livers.
22987314|a|The wider use of livers from expanded criteria donors and donation after circulatory death donors may help to improve access to liver transplantation. A prerequisite for safely using these higher risk livers is the development of objective criteria for assessing their condition before transplantation. Compared to simple cold storage, hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) provides a unique window for evaluating liver grafts between procurement and transplantation. In this proof-of-concept study, we tested basic parameters during HMP that may reflect the condition of human liver grafts, and we assessed their morphology after prolonged HMP. Seventeen discarded human livers were machine-perfused. Eleven livers were nontransplantable (major absolute contraindications and severe macrovesicular steatosis in the majority of the cases). Six livers were found in retrospect to be transplantable but could not be allocated and served as controls. Metabolic parameters (pH, lactate, partial pressure of oxygen, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide), enzyme release in the perfusate [aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)], and arterial/portal resistances were monitored during HMP. Nontransplantable livers released more AST and LDH than transplantable livers. In contrast, arterial/portal vascular resistances and metabolic profiles did not differ between the 2 groups. Morphologically, transplantable livers remained well preserved after 24 hours of HMP. In conclusion, HMP preserves the morphology of human livers for prolonged periods. A biochemical analysis of the perfusate provides information reflecting the extent of the injury endured.

7695020|t|Helicobacter infection and gastric ethanol metabolism.
7695020|a|The organism frequently colonizing the stomach of patients suffering from chronic active gastritis and peptic ulcer disease--Helicobacter pylori--possesses marked alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity. Consequently, Helicobacter infection may contribute to the capacity of the stomach to metabolize ethanol and lead to increased acetaldehyde production. To study this hypothesis, we first determined ADH activity in a variety of H. pylori strains originally isolated from human gastric mucosal biopsies. ADH activity was also measured in endoscopic gastric mucosal specimens obtained from H. pylori-positive and -negative patients. Furthermore, we used a mouse model of Helicobacter infection to determine whether infected animals exhibit more gastric ethanol metabolism than noninfected controls. Most of the 32 H. pylori strains studied possessed clear ADH activity and produced acetaldehyde. In humans, gastric ADH activity of corpus mucosa did not differ between H. pylori-positive and -negative subjects, whereas in antral biopsies ADH activity was significantly lower in infected patients. In mice, gastric ADH activity was similar or even lower in infected animals than in controls, depending on the duration of infection, despite the fact that the infectious agent used--Helicobacter felis--showed ADH activity in vitro. In accordance with this, Helicobacter infection tended to decrease rather than increase gastric ethanol metabolism in mice. In humans, it remains to be established whether the observed decrease in antral ADH activity associated with H. pylori infection can lead to reduced gastric first-pass metabolism of ethanol.

15689417|t|Oxidative stress mediates sodium arsenite-induced expression of heme oxygenase-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and interleukin-6 in vascular smooth muscle cells.
15689417|a|Arsenic exposure is associated with an increased risk of vascular disorders, and results in increased oxidative stress in endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Since oxidative stress is involved in regulating the expression of genes related to atherogenesis, we investigated its involvement in the enhanced expression of three atherosclerosis-related genes coding for heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in VSMCs treated with inorganic sodium arsenite (iAs). In human VSMCs (hVSMCs) and rat VSMCs (rVSMCs), HO-1, MCP-1, and IL-6 mRNA levels were significantly increased by iAs treatment. An increase in HO-1 protein levels in hVSMCs was confirmed by Western blotting technique, while increased MCP-1 and IL-6 secretion by hVSMCs was demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Although modulators of oxidative stress inhibited this iAs-induced increase in the expression of these three genes, different modulators had differential effects. In iAs-treated rVSMCs, catalase, dimethylsulfoxide, and L-omega-nitro-L-arginine significantly inhibited the increase in expression of all three genes, allopurinol inhibited the increase in MCP-1 and IL-6 expression, but had no effect on HO-1 expression, while superoxide dismutase had no significant effect on HO-1 expression, but had an inhibitory effect on IL-6 expression and a stimulatory effect on MCP-1 expression. Therefore, iAs may enhance the expression of HO-1, MCP-1, and IL-6 in VSMCs via different reactive oxygen molecules. Furthermore, using tin protoporphyrin IX (SnPP) and anti-MCP-1 antibody to abolish iAs-induced HO-1 and MCP-1 activity, respectively, shows that HO-1 has protective effect against iAs-induced injury in VSMCs and MCP-1 is chemoattractive to human monocytes, THP-1.

12626517|t|The binding sites on human heme oxygenase-1 for cytochrome p450 reductase and biliverdin reductase.
12626517|a|Human heme oxygenase-1 (hHO-1) catalyzes the NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase-dependent oxidation of heme to biliverdin, CO, and free iron. The biliverdin is subsequently reduced to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase. Earlier kinetic studies suggested that biliverdin reductase facilitates the release of biliverdin from hHO-1 (Liu, Y., and Ortiz de Montellano, P. R. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 5297-5307). We have investigated the binding of P450 reductase and biliverdin reductase to truncated, soluble hHO-1 by fluorescence resonance energy transfer and site-specific mutagenesis. P450 reductase and biliverdin reductase bind to truncated hHO-1 with Kd = 0.4 +/- 0.1 and 0.2 +/- 0.1 microm, respectively. FRET experiments indicate that biliverdin reductase and P450 reductase compete for binding to truncated hHO-1. Mutation of surface ionic residues shows that hHO-1 residues Lys18, Lys22, Lys179, Arg183, Arg198, Glu19, Glu127, and Glu190 contribute to the binding of cytochrome P450 reductase. The mutagenesis results and a computational analysis of the protein surfaces partially define the binding site for P450 reductase. An overlapping binding site including Lys18, Lys22, Lys179, Arg183, and Arg185 is similarly defined for biliverdin reductase. These results confirm the binding of biliverdin reductase to hHO-1 and define binding sites of the two reductases.

2114503|t|[The hemostasis system in hypoxic anoxia of varying degree].
2114503|a|This paper presents an overview of investigations of blood coagulation of man exposed to hypoxic hypoxia or hypoxia combined with hypercapnia. Blood coagulation changes were related to the level of hypoxia and correlated with variations in blood gases and acid-base characteristics. Prognostic criteria associated with increased coagulation in response to hypoxia were formulated. It was found that hypoxia of any degree reduced significantly the stimulation effect of epinephrine on blood coagulation and fibrinolysis. The paper discusses the relationship between respiratory and hemostatic functions of blood and mechanisms regulating its aggregation during hypoxia of various degree. It is recommended to add carbon dioxide in moderate concentrations to the hypoxic environment in order to prevent blood hypercoagulation and to increase its resistance to acute hypoxia and epinephrine-induced lesions. It is concluded that the functional state of the blood coagulation system is controlled by the concentration and proportion of oxygen and carbon dioxide, i. e. biologically active gases, in inhaled air and blood.

24097127|t|Nonclinical toxicology assessments support the chronic safety of dapagliflozin, a first-in-class sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor.
24097127|a|Dapagliflozin, a first-in-class, selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), promotes urinary glucose excretion to reduce hyperglycemia for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. A series of nonclinical studies were undertaken to evaluate dapagliflozin in species where it was shown to have pharmacologic activity comparable with that in humans at doses that resulted in supratherapeutic exposures. In vitro screening (>300 targets; 10 μmol/L) indicated no significant off-target activities for dapagliflozin or its primary human metabolite. Once daily, orally administered dapagliflozin was evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats (≤6 months) and in beagle dogs (≤1 year) at exposures >5000-fold those observed at the maximum recommended human clinical dose (MRHD; 10 mg). Anticipated, pharmacologically mediated effects of glucosuria, osmotic diuresis, and mild electrolyte loss were observed, but there were no adverse effects at clinically relevant exposures, including in the kidneys or urogenital tract. The SGLT2-/- mice, which show chronic glucosuria, and dapagliflozin-treated, wild-type mice exhibited similar safety profiles. In rats but not dogs, dapagliflozin at >2000-fold MRHD exposures resulted in tissue mineralization and trabecular bone accretion. Investigative studies suggested that the effect was not relevant to human safety, since it was partially related to off-target inhibition of SGLT1, which was observed only at high doses of dapagliflozin and resulted in intestinal glucose malabsorption and increased intestinal calcium absorption. The rigorous assessment of supra- and off-target dapagliflozin pharmacology in nonclinical species allowed for a thorough evaluation of potential toxicity, providing us with confidence in its safety in patients with diabetes.

196086|t|ATPase and phosphatase activities from human red cell membranes: I. The effects of N-ethylmaleimide.
196086|a|In human red cell membranes the sensitivity to N-ethylmaleimide of Ca2+-dependent ATPase and phosphatase activities is at least ten times larger than the sensitivity to N-ethylmaleimide of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase and K+-activated phosphatase activities. All activities are partially protected against N-ethylmaleimide by ATP but not by inorganic phosphate or by p-nitrophenylphosphate. (ii) Protection by ATP of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase is impeded by either Na+ or K+ whereas only K+ impedes protection by ATP of K+-activated phosphatase. On the other hand, Na+ or K+ slightly protects Ca2+-dependent activities against N-ethylmaleimide, this effect being independent of ATP. (iii) The sensitivity to N-ethylmaleimide of Ca2+-dependent ATPase and phosphatase activities is markedly enhanced by low concentrations of Ca2+. This effect is half-maximal at less than 1 micron Ca2+ and does not require ATP, which suggests that sites with high affinity for Ca2+ exist in the Ca2+-ATPase in the absence of ATP. (IV) Under all conditions tested the response to N-ethylmaleimide of the ATPase and phosphatase activities stimulated by K+ or Na+ in the presence of Ca2+ parallels that of the Ca2+-dependent activities, suggesting that the Ca2+-ATPase system possesses sites at which monovalent cations bind to increase its activity.

2262067|t|Polyamine uptake by human colon carcinoma cell line CaCo-2.
2262067|a|The intracellular concentrations of the polyamines are highly regulated and high polyamine concentrations are associated with rapidly proliferating cells. Hormones, nutrients and growth factors that stimulate the proliferation of the intestinal epithelium, increase the intracellular polyamine concentration mainly by activating ODC expression. Other cell types stimulated to proliferate satisfy their requirement for polyamines by increasing polyamine uptake. In the present study, we investigated polyamine uptake by a human colon carcinoma cell line, CaCo-2. Uptake of putrescine, spermidine and spermine by CaCo-2 cells was saturable and temperature dependent and all polyamines appear to share a common carrier. The carrier of differentiated cells had an apparently higher affinity and lower activity than the carrier of replicating cells. Culture of CaCo-2 cells on porous filters showed that polyamine accumulation occurred mainly through the basolateral membrane in replicating cells, while an increase in the rate of apical uptake was observed after differentiation. A significant increase in polyamine uptake and in ODC expression resulted from fresh medium replacement, a well-known stimulus to proliferation; no change in uptake occurred after ODC inhibition by DFMO. We conclude that CaCo-2 cells are able to increase their polyamine concentration by both enhanced synthesis and increased polyamine uptake.

15573472|t|13-week dietary toxicity study of ammonium perfluorooctanoate (APFO) in male rats.
15573472|a|Ammonium perfluorooctanoate is a perfluorinated carboxylate that is used commercially as a processing aid in the production of fluorinated polymers. Perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) has been found in human blood of the general population from exogenous sources. This report presents the results of a 13-week dietary toxicity study in male rats and was designed to identify potential target organ(s), dose response, and to explore possible relationships of PPARalpha activation to potential liver effects and hormonal changes. Rats were fed dietary levels of 0, 1, 10, 30, and 100 ppm (equivalent to 0, 0.06, 0.64, 1.94, and 6.5 mg/kg/day) for 13 weeks. A control group pair-fed adjusted to the 100 ppm level and groups allowed to recover for 8 weeks were included. Sacrifices were conducted after 4, 7, and 13 weeks of feeding and after 8 weeks of recovery. At each sacrifice, gross and histopathology was conducted on selected tissues and measurements of hepatic palmitoyl CoA oxidase (PCoAO), as well as serum estradiol, luteinizing hormone, testosterone, and PFOA were determined. There were no clinical signs or mortality. Body weight gains were reduced in the 100 ppm dose group. Liver weights (absolute and relative), PCoAO activity, and hepatocyte hypertrophy (minimal to mild) were increased in the 10 ppm dose group and above and were reversible in recovery. Under the study conditions, hormone levels appeared unchanged. PFOA serum concentrations increased in a dose-related fashion, appeared to reach steady-state by test week 5, and declined rapidly through the recovery period. Serum PFOA concentrations at the end of the treatment period were 7.1, 41, 70, and 138 microg/mL in the 1, 10, 30 and 100 ppm dose groups. The study no effect level was 1 ppm (0.06 microg/mg) with doses of 10 ppm (0.64 microg/mg) and higher producing adaptive and reversible liver changes.

11054703|t|Neurons expressing NADPH-diaphorase in the developing human spinal cord.
11054703|a|The present study used nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-diaphorase histochemistry to identify populations of neurons containing nitric oxide synthase and to describe their putative migration during development of the human spinal cord. As early as week 6 (W6) of gestation, diaphorase expression was observed in sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPNs) and interneurons of the ventral horn. As development proceeded, the SPNs translocated dorsally to form the intermediolateral nucleus, and the interneurons remained scattered throughout the ventral horn. In addition to the dorsal translocation of SPNs, a unique dorsomedially directed migratory pathway was observed. At later stages of development, other groups of SPNs were identified laterally in the lateral funiculus and medially in the intercalated and central autonomic regions. In addition, two "U-shaped" groups of diaphorase-labeled cells were identified around the ventral ventricular zone at W7. Cells of these groups appeared to translocate dorsally over the next weeks and presumably give rise to interneurons within the deep dorsal horn and surrounding the central canal. Furthermore, during W7-14 of gestation, the deep dorsal horn contained a number of diaphorase-positive cells, whereas the superficial dorsal horn was relatively free of staining. These data demonstrate that nitric oxide is present very early in human spinal cord development and that two unique cell migrations initially observed in rodents have now been identified in humans. Furthermore, nitric oxide may be expressed in some populations of neurons as they migrate to their final positions, suggesting that this molecule may play a role in neuronal development.

8243611|t|Production of oxygen radicals by fibroblasts and neutrophils from a patient with x-linked chronic granulomatous disease.
8243611|a|Recently, a superoxide-generating NADPH-oxidase system in human fibroblasts has been described. Therefore, we reassessed the possible use of this cell type for prenatal diagnosis of CGD patients comparing normal and CGD peripheral blood neutrophils (PMN) and skin fibroblasts in their reactive oxygen intermediate (ROI)-producing capacity. While PMN of the CGD patient showed a clearly reduced respiratory burst activity, which correlated well with the measured content of cytochrome b558, fibroblasts of the same individual showed no impaired production of superoxide anion or H2O2 upon stimulation by cytokines (TNF and IL-1) or other agents (Ca2+ ionophores and PAF, unpublished results). Furthermore, fibroblasts of the CGD patient or of normal donors could be inhibited in ROI production by diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and 2-iodobiphenyl. In contrast to PMN, no inhibition of the fibroblast NADPH-oxidase system was observed using staurosporin, an inhibitor of proteinkinase C. These data demonstrate, in contrast to previous studies, that fibroblasts are able to produce ROI. Nevertheless, since fibroblasts obtained from a CGD patient exhibited no difference in ROI production compared with fibroblasts obtained from healthy donors, they are not suitable for prenatal diagnosis of CGD.

8612756|t|Generation of active oxygen in elicited cells of Arabidopsis thaliana is mediated by a NADPH oxidase-like enzyme.
8612756|a|Suspension-cultured cells of Arabidopsis thaliana generated active oxygen species (AOS) (measured by luminol-dependent chemiluminescence) following challenge with the bacterial protein elicitor harpin or the protein kinase activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. These responses were blocked by inhibitors of superoxide dismutase (SOD), NADPH oxidase and protein kinase. Harpin treatment also resulted in an increase in cell death, a response reduced by inhibitors of AOS generation or AOS scavengers. Extracellular SOD activity was found to be present in cell culture medium. Immunoblotting of Arabidopsis extracts revealed the presence of proteins immunologically related to the human neutrophil NADPH oxidase complex, and cell-free reconstitution assays showed that human neutrophil cytosol combined with Arabidopsis membranes could initiate superoxide generation. These data suggest that the enzyme catalysing the generation of superoxide in elicited Arabidopsis cells is similar to the mammalian NADPH oxidase and that a signalling cascade leading to AOS generation involves protein phosphorylation.

19087243|t|Combinatorial control of gene expression by the three yeast repressors Mig1, Mig2 and Mig3.
19087243|a|BACKGROUND: Expression of a large number of yeast genes is repressed by glucose. The zinc finger protein Mig1 is the main effector in glucose repression, but yeast also has two related proteins: Mig2 and Mig3. We have used microarrays to study global gene expression in all possible combinations of mig1, mig2 and mig3 deletion mutants. RESULTS: Mig1 and Mig2 repress a largely overlapping set of genes on 2% glucose. Genes that are upregulated in a mig1 mig2 double mutant were grouped according to the contribution of Mig2. Most of them show partially redundant repression, with Mig1 being the major repressor, but some genes show complete redundancy, and some are repressed only by Mig1. Several redundantly repressed genes are involved in phosphate metabolism. The promoters of these genes are enriched for Pho4 sites, a novel GGGAGG motif, and a variant Mig1 site which is absent from genes repressed only by Mig1. Genes repressed only by Mig1 on 2% glucose include the hexose transporter gene HXT4, but Mig2 contributes to HXT4 repression on 10% glucose. HXT6 is one of the few genes that are more strongly repressed by Mig2. Mig3 does not seem to overlap in function with Mig1 and Mig2. Instead, Mig3 downregulates the SIR2 gene encoding a histone deacetylase involved in gene silencing and the control of aging. CONCLUSION: Mig2 fine-tunes glucose repression by targeting a subset of the Mig1-repressed genes, and by responding to higher glucose concentrations. Mig3 does not target the same genes as Mig1 and Mig2, but instead downregulates the SIR2 gene.

2684801|t|The molecular genetics of superoxide dismutase in E. coli. An approach to understanding the biological role and regulation of SODS in relation to other elements of the defence system against oxygen toxicity.
2684801|a|Superoxide-mediated oxidative stress initiates a chain of events resulting in numerous cellular injuries. We have used genetics and E. coli to investigate the role and regulation of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and its relationship with the other constituents of the oxygen toxicity defence system. Structural SOD genes have been cloned and sequenced, permitting us to refine structural analysis and to isolate SOD-deficient mutants. The conditional oxygen sensitivity of these mutants, together with their increased mutation rate, demonstrated the essential biological role of SOD. Furthermore the complementation of SOD-lacking E. coli deficiencies by introducing a plasmid containing the gene encoding the human SOD supported the proposal that superoxide dismutation is the physiological function of SOD. Regulation of the MnSOD, through which the global SOD level in E. coli is modulated, has been studied using operon and protein fusions with the lactose operon, and led to the conclusion of a multicontrol of MnSOD. Isolation and characterization of regulation mutants are in progress, with the aim of identifying effectors and targets involved in the response to superoxide-mediated oxidative stress.

22121073|t|Biomimetic chitosan-calcium phosphate composites with potential applications as bone substitutes: preparation and characterization.
22121073|a|A novel biomimetic technique for obtaining chitosan-calcium phosphates (Cs-CP) scaffolds are presented: calcium phosphates are precipitated from its precursors, CaCl(2) and NaH(2) PO(4) on the Cs matrix, under physiological conditions (human body temperature and body fluid pH; 37°C and pH = 7.2, respectively). Materials composition and structure have been confirmed by various techniques: elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). FTIR and SEM data have shown the arrangement of the calcium phosphates-hydroxyapatite (CP-Hap) onto Cs matrix. In this case the polymer is acting as glue, bonding the calcium phosphates crystals. Behavior in biological simulated fluids (phosphate buffer solution-PBS and PBS-albumin) revealed an important contribution of the chelation between -NH3(+) and Ca(2+) on the scaffold interaction with aqueous mediums; increased quantities of chitosan in composites permit the interaction with human albumin and improve the retention of fluid. The composites are slightly degraded by the lysozyme which facilitates an in vivo degradation control of bone substitutes. Modulus of elasticity is strongly dependent of the ratio chitosan/calcium phosphates and recommends the obtained biomimetic composites as promising materials for a prospective bone application.

15009201|t|Genetic approaches to the cellular functions of polyamines in mammals.
15009201|a|The polyamines putrescine, spermidine and spermine are organic cations shown to participate in a bewildering number of cellular reactions, yet their exact functions in intermediary metabolism and specific interactions with cellular components remain largely elusive. Pharmacological interventions have demonstrated convincingly that a steady supply of these compounds is a prerequisite for cell proliferation to occur. The last decade has witnessed the appearance of a substantial number of studies, in which genetic engineering of polyamine metabolism in transgenic rodents has been employed to unravel their cellular functions. Transgenic activation of polyamine biosynthesis through an overexpression of their biosynthetic enzymes has assigned specific roles for these compounds in spermatogenesis, skin physiology, promotion of tumorigenesis and organ hypertrophy as well as neuronal protection. Transgenic activation of polyamine catabolism not only profoundly disturbs polyamine homeostasis in most tissues, but also creates a complex phenotype affecting skin, female fertility, fat depots, pancreatic integrity and regenerative growth. Transgenic expression of ornithine decarboxylase antizyme has suggested that this unique protein may act as a general tumor suppressor. Homozygous deficiency of the key biosynthetic enzymes of the polyamines, ornithine and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, as achieved through targeted disruption of their genes, is not compatible with murine embryogenesis. Finally, the first reports of human diseases apparently caused by mutations or rearrangements of the genes involved in polyamine metabolism have appeared.

19060123|t|Aldose reductase mediates myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in part by opening mitochondrial permeability transition pore.
19060123|a|Aldose reductase (AR), a member of the aldo-keto reductase family, has been demonstrated to play a central role in mediating myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Recently, using transgenic mice broadly overexpressing human AR (ARTg), we demonstrated that AR is an important component of myocardial I/R injury and that inhibition of this enzyme protects heart from I/R injury (20-22, 48, 49, 56). To rigorously delineate mechanisms by which AR pathway influences myocardial ischemic injury, we investigated the role played by reactive oxygen species (ROS), antioxidant enzymes, and mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore opening in hearts from ARTg or littermates [wild type (WT)] subjected to I/R. MPT pore opening after I/R was determined using mitochondrial uptake of 2-deoxyglucose ratio, while H2O2 was measured as a key indicator of ROS. Myocardial 2-deoxyglucose uptake ratio and calcium-induced swelling were significantly greater in mitochondria from ARTg mice than in WT mice. Blockade of MPT pore with cyclosphorin A during I/R reduced ischemic injury significantly in ARTg mice hearts. H2O2 measurements indicated mitochondrial ROS generation after I/R was significantly greater in ARTg mitochondria than in WT mice hearts. Furthermore, the levels of antioxidant GSH were significantly reduced in ARTg mitochondria than in WT. Resveratrol treatment or pharmacological blockade of AR significantly reduced ROS generation and MPT pore opening in mitochondria of ARTg mice hearts exposed to I/R stress. This study demonstrates that MPT pore opening is a key event by which AR pathway mediates myocardial I/R injury, and that the MPT pore opening after I/R is triggered, in part, by increases in ROS generation in ARTg mice hearts. Therefore, inhibition of AR pathway protects mitochondria and hence may be a useful adjunct for salvaging ischemic myocardium.

9126339|t|Inducible nitric oxide synthase expression and erythropoietin production in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
9126339|a|We have previously reported an interaction of nitric oxide (NO) and cyclic 3',5'-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in erythropoietin (Epo) production. Further studies have been carried out to clarify the role of NO in the hypoxic regulation of Epo production in Epo producing human hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep3B) cells, which produce Epo in response to physiological stimuli. Our reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique revealed the expression of iNOS mRNA in Hep3B cells after incubation under hypoxic (1% O2) conditions for 6 hr. Hypoxia also significantly increased medium levels of nitrite in Hep3B cells. In order to investigate the role of NO in Epo production in Hep3B cells under normoxic (20% O2) conditions, we have studied the effects of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) on Epo production. IFN-gamma is known to induce iNOS and enhance the production of NO. IFN-gamma produced significant increases in medium levels of Epo and nitrite. IFN-gamma also significantly increased cGMP levels in Hep3B cells. Furthermore, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an NO synthase inhibitor, significantly decreased IFN-gamma induced elevations in medium levels of Epo and nitrite as well as cGMP levels in Hep3B cells. These results provide further support for an important role of the NO/cGMP system in hypoxic regulation of Epo production in Hep3B cells.

1574534|t|Incomplete reversibility of an experimentally induced hypocholinergic state: biochemical and physiological, but not behavioral, recovery.
1574534|a|In previous reports, we described the experimental development of a hypocholinergic state in rats following the total replacement of dietary choline by an artificial isostere, N-aminodeanol (NADe). NADe shares most of the physicochemical and biochemical characteristics of choline (Ch) but is utilized less efficiently in pathways leading to the formation of both acetylcholine and phospholipids. This experimental model mimics many of the features of human degenrative dementias. We now discuss the behavioral and physiological effects of restoring a normal diet after the hypocholinergic state has become well established. The procedure by which that state was induced has been described in detail in earlier publications. After replacing Ch in the diets of weanling rats for 270 days, NADe replaced 70-85% of the phospholipid-bound Ch in plasma, brain, and peripheral tissue. When dietary NADe was removed and Ch was restored in the diet, NADe disappeared and plasma and erythrocyte (RBC) choline levels returned to normal within 30-60 days. Quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) binding showed that muscarinic receptors continued to be depressed in animals remaining on the NADe diet, but returned to control levels in the reversal group. There were no differences in cholinesterase activity among the three treatments. Choline acetyltransferase activity returned to control levels, while continuing to be lower in the NADe animals. Liver lipids were elevated in the latter and not significantly different in the control and reversal groups. Among physiological functions, body weight increased more rapidly in the reversal group than in animals continuing on the NADe diet. Brain weights of the reversal animals were significantly greater than those of animals not reversed, but less than controls. Core body temperatures did not differ from controls at any time during the reversal period. Behaviorally, nociceptive thresholds indicative of sensory-reflexive and sensory-perceptual responses remained significantly below normal, that is, a hyperalgesic state. Reversal animals also remained hyperactive and displayed memory significantly poorer than those on the normal diet, that is, no improvement over animals continuing on NADe. In general, the results suggest that behavioral losses induced by NADe reflect persisting changes in the CNS, despite essentially complete recovery of biochemical parameters. The changes may be morphological or be associated with adaptive changes in other neurochemical events in the CNS.

10866044|t|Effects of glucosamine infusion on insulin secretion and insulin action in humans.
10866044|a|Glucose toxicity (i.e., glucose-induced reduction in insulin secretion and action) may be mediated by an increased flux through the hexosamine-phosphate pathway. Glucosamine (GlcN) is widely used to accelerate the hexosamine pathway flux, independently of glucose. We tested the hypothesis that GlcN can affect insulin secretion and/or action in humans. In 10 healthy subjects, we sequentially performed an intravenous glucose (plus [2-3H]glucose) tolerance test (IVGTT) and a euglycemic insulin clamp during either a saline infusion or a low (1.6 micromol x min(-1) x kg(-1)) or high (5 micromol x min(-1) x kg(-1) [n = 5]) GlcN infusion. Beta-cell secretion, insulin (SI*-IVGTT), and glucose (SG*) action on glucose utilization during the IVGTT were measured according to minimal models of insulin secretion and action. Infusion of GlcN did not affect readily releasable insulin levels, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), or the time constant of secretion, but it increased both the glucose threshold of GSIS (delta approximately 0.5-0.8 mmol/l, P < 0.03-0.01) and plasma fasting glucose levels (delta approximately 0.3-0.5 mmol/l, P < 0.05-0.02). GlcN did not change glucose utilization or intracellular metabolism (glucose oxidation and glucose storage were measured by indirect calorimetry) during the clamp. However, high levels of GlcN caused a decrease in SI*-IVGTT (delta approximately 30%, P < 0.02) and in SG* (delta approximately 40%, P < 0.05). Thus, in humans, acute GlcN infusion recapitulates some metabolic features of human diabetes. It remains to be determined whether acceleration of the hexosamine pathway can cause insulin resistance at euglycemia in humans.

11367867|a|Nonenzymatic glycosylation of proteins is a weighty consequence of hyperglycaemia in diabetes. This study examines the possible effect of copper(II) ions on the glycosylation of human serum albumin (HSA) and the resulting formation of advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs). HSA in phosphate-buffered saline was incubated with 100 mmol/l glucose. The effect of addition of copper(II) ions and/or aminoguanidine bicarbonate (CAS 2582-30-1) was investigated. The determination of AGE levels derived from glycosylated/glycoxidated HSA was performed using a specific spectrofluorometric assay (excitation 346 nm; emission 418 nm). The results showed that the addition of copper(II) ions to the incubation medium containing glucose increased the formation of AGEs. Further, in the presence of copper(II) ions, a significant blockade of aminoguanidine inhibitory effect on the formation of AGEs was observed.

21082368|t|The blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier: structure and functional significance.
21082368|a|The choroid plexus (CP) of the blood-CSF barrier (BCSFB) displays fundamentally different properties than blood-brain barrier (BBB). With brisk blood flow (10 × brain) and highly permeable capillaries, the human CP provides the CNS with a high turnover rate of fluid (∼400,000 μL/day) containing micronutrients, peptides, and hormones for neuronal networks. Renal-like basement membranes in microvessel walls and underneath the epithelium filter large proteins such as ferritin and immunoglobulins. Type IV collagen (α3, α4, and α5) in the subepithelial basement membrane confers kidney-like permselectivity. As in the glomerulus, so also in CP, the basolateral membrane utrophin A and colocalized dystrophin impart structural stability, transmembrane signaling, and ion/water homeostasis. Extensive infoldings of the plasma-facing basal labyrinth together with lush microvilli at the CSF-facing membrane afford surface area, as great as that at BBB, for epithelial solute and water exchange. CSF formation occurs by basolateral carrier-mediated uptake of Na+, Cl-, and HCO3-, followed by apical release via ion channel conductance and osmotic flow of water through AQP1 channels. Transcellular epithelial active transport and secretion are energized and channeled via a highly dense organelle network of mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi; bleb formation occurs at the CSF surface. Claudin-2 in tight junctions helps to modulate the lower electrical resistance and greater permeability in CP than at BBB. Still, ratio analyses of influx coefficients (Kin) for radiolabeled solutes indicate that paracellular diffusion of small nonelectrolytes (e.g., urea and mannitol) through tight junctions is restricted; molecular sieving is proportional to solute size. Protein/peptide movement across BCSFB is greatly limited, occurring by paracellular leaks through incomplete tight junctions and low-capacity transcellular pinocytosis/exocytosis. Steady-state concentration ratios, CSF/plasma, ranging from 0.003 for IgG to 0.80 for urea, provide insight on plasma solute penetrability, barrier permeability, and CSF sink action to clear substances from CNS.

14711638|t|Directed evolution of pyruvate decarboxylase-negative Saccharomyces cerevisiae, yielding a C2-independent, glucose-tolerant, and pyruvate-hyperproducing yeast.
14711638|a|The absence of alcoholic fermentation makes pyruvate decarboxylase-negative (Pdc(-)) strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae an interesting platform for further metabolic engineering of central metabolism. However, Pdc(-) S. cerevisiae strains have two growth defects: (i) growth on synthetic medium in glucose-limited chemostat cultures requires the addition of small amounts of ethanol or acetate and (ii) even in the presence of a C(2) compound, these strains cannot grow in batch cultures on synthetic medium with glucose. We used two subsequent phenotypic selection strategies to obtain a Pdc(-) strain without these growth defects. An acetate-independent Pdc(-) mutant was obtained via (otherwise) glucose-limited chemostat cultivation by progressively lowering the acetate content in the feed. Transcriptome analysis did not reveal the mechanisms behind the C(2) independence. Further selection for glucose tolerance in shake flasks resulted in a Pdc(-) S. cerevisiae mutant (TAM) that could grow in batch cultures ( micro (max) = 0.20 h(-1)) on synthetic medium, with glucose as the sole carbon source. Although the exact molecular mechanisms underlying the glucose-tolerant phenotype were not resolved, transcriptome analysis of the TAM strain revealed increased transcript levels of many glucose-repressible genes relative to the isogenic wild type in nitrogen-limited chemostat cultures with excess glucose. In pH-controlled aerobic batch cultures, the TAM strain produced large amounts of pyruvate. By repeated glucose feeding, a pyruvate concentration of 135 g liter(-1) was obtained, with a specific pyruvate production rate of 6 to 7 mmol g of biomass(-1) h(-1) during the exponential-growth phase and an overall yield of 0.54 g of pyruvate g of glucose(-1).

7398265|t|Further studies of effects of vehicles and elicitation concentration in experimental contact sensitization testing in humans.
7398265|a|Further confirmation of the effects of vehicles and elicitation concentration in experimental contact sensitization testing with fragrance ingredients is reported. A dose-response relation was seen when sensitized human subjects were challenged with dihydrocoumarin, alantroot oil and diethylmalleate. Furthermore, alcohol was shown to be a more effective vehicle than petrolatum, when cinnamon bark oil, vetiver acetate and diethylmalleate were used in predictive tests. The relation of these findings to risk-benefit judgments is discussed briefly.

16347231|t|Factors affecting high-oxygen survival of heterotrophic microorganisms from an antarctic lake.
16347231|a|We sought to determine factors relating to the survival of heterotrophic microorganisms from the high-dissolved-oxygen (HDO) waters of Lake Hoare, Antarctica. This lake contains perpetual HDO about three times that of normal saturation (40 to 50 mg liter). Five isolates, one yeast and four bacteria, were selected from Lake Hoare waters by growth with the membrane filter technique with oxygen added to yield dissolved concentrations 14 times that in situ, 175 mg liter. One bacterial isolate was obtained from the microbial mat beneath the HDO waters. This organism was isolated at normal atmospheric oxygen saturation. The bacteria were gram-negative rods, motile, oxidase positive, catalase positive, and superoxide dismutase positive; they contained carotenoids. The planktonic isolates grew in media containing 10 mg of Trypticase soy (BBL Microbiology Systems)-peptone (2:1) liter but not at 10 g liter. Under low-nutrient levels simulating Lake Hoare waters (10 mg liter), two of the planktonic isolates tested were not inhibited by HDO. Growth inhibition by HDO increased as nutrient concentration was increased. A carotenoid-negative mutant of one isolate demonstrated a decreased growth rate, maximal cell density, and increased cell lysis in the death phase under HDO compared with the parent strain. The specific activity of superoxide dismutase was increased by HDO in four of the five bacterial isolates. The superoxide dismutase was of the manganese type on the basis of inhibition and electrophoretic studies. The bacterial isolates from Lake Hoare possess several adaptations which may aid their survival in the HDO waters, as well as protection due to the oligotrophic nature of the lake.

7449797|t|Human body composition as related to surface area.
7449797|a|There is a linear relationship between extracellular fluid and body surface area in man. During growth the body cell mass, fat-free solids, and body fat proportions of body weight increase while the extracellular fluid fraction decreases. Growth stops in men as soon as the body cell mass reaches 22.5 kg/m2 body surface area and in women when it reaches 16.9 kg/m5. The non-muscle cell mass and the muscle cell mass reach a 1:4 ratio in men whereas in women a 1:35 proportion--which is more favorable for pregnancy and lactation--is reached. The body composition of the newborn and the infant have fetal characteristics with a low body fat: surface area ratio and a low non-muscle cell mass: surface area ratio. The basal metabolic rate depends on the amount of non-muscle mass present, and the total energy change depends on body cell mass. This has been established by measurements of total body potassium, thiosulfate space, total body sodium, 24 h urine creatinine values and basal metabolic rate.

14715710|t|Molten globule structure and steroidogenic activity of N-218 MLN64 in human placental mitochondria.
14715710|a|Progesterone synthesis by the human placenta requires the conversion of mitochondrial cholesterol to pregnenolone by cytochrome P450scc. Most steroidogenic tissues use the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) to deliver cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane where P450scc is located, but StAR is not expressed in the human placenta. However, the human placenta does express MLN64, which has a C-terminal domain homologous to StAR that can also transport cholesterol. We investigated the ability of bacterially expressed N-218 MLN64 and N-62 StAR to transport cholesterol between artificial membranes and to its inner membrane site of use in placental mitochondria. Urea denaturation experiments show that N-218 MLN64 undergoes a pH-dependent and denaturant-dependent structural transition to a molten globule state, as reported previously for N-62 StAR. N-218 MLN64 stimulated cholesterol transfer between artificial phospholipid vesicles with an initial rate of 6.5 mol/min.mol N-218 MLN64. Both N-218 MLN64 and N-62 StAR stimulated cholesterol transfer to the inner mitochondrial membrane, as evidenced by a 6-fold stimulation of pregnenolone synthesis with saturating transporter. This stimulation was seen only after the endogenous cholesterol in the steroidogenic pool of the isolated mitochondria was first depleted. No stimulation was observed by N-218 MLN64 or N-62 StAR when 20alpha-hydroxycholesterol was added as substrate for P450scc, confirming that these proteins stimulate P450scc activity by enhancing cholesterol transport. MLN64 levels in placental JEG-3 cells were unresponsive to stimulation by 8-bromo-cAMP over 24 h. These data show that human N-218 MLN64 and N-62 StAR have similar biophysical and functional properties and are able to stimulate steroidogenesis in a human placental system, which normally lacks StAR. The results reveal that with saturating MLN64, steroidogenesis by placental mitochondria proceeds at near-maximal rate.

11880691|t|The role of O2 supply in muscle fatigue.
11880691|a|It is well established that altering O2 delivery to contracting skeletal muscle affects human performance. In this respect, a reduced O2 supply (e.g., hypoxia) increases the rate of muscle fatigue, whereas increasing O2 supply (e.g., hyperoxia) reduces the rate of fatigue. Interestingly, the faster onset of fatigue in moderate hypoxia does not appear to be a consequence of mitochondrial O2 limitation because these effects occur at submaximal rates of O2 consumption for these conditions and at O2 tensions well above that which impairs mitochondrial O2 uptake in vitro. Alterations in O2 supply modulate the regulation of cellular respiration and may affect the onset of impaired Ca2+ handling with fatigue. Specifically, changes in O2 supply alter the coupling between phosphocreatine hydrolysis and O2 uptake in contracting muscles, which by determining the rate of inorganic phosphate (Pi) accumulation may affect Ca2+ release. Partial ischemia differs somewhat in that the reduction in force could be due to reduced O2 supply and/or impaired removal of metabolic by-products secondary to insufficient blood flow. Nonetheless, recent evidence shows a parallel decline and restoration of force with alterations in O2 supply but not blood flow alone during submaximal contractions. Furthermore, the causes of fatigue are similar when O2 is plentiful and when it is reduced.

2512683|t|Effect of the concentration of Ca2+ in the suspending medium on the responses of human and rabbit platelets to aggregating agents.
2512683|a|The effect of the concentration of Ca2+ in the suspending medium of human and rabbit platelets on aggregation, release of 14C-serotonin, and TXB2 formation in response to ADP, thrombin, 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glyceryl-3-phosphorylcholine (PAF), collagen and arachidonic acid was studied in either platelet-rich plasma anticoagulated with D-phenylalanyl-prolyl-arginyl chloromethylketone (PPACK) or citrate, or suspensions of washed platelets in modified Tyrode-albumin solutions containing 1 mM Mg2+ and concentrations of added Ca2+ ranging from 0 to 5 mM. In response to ADP, thrombin, or PAF, human platelets were stimulated to form TXA2 by close platelet contact in a low-Ca2+ medium; at physiological concentrations of Ca2+, TXB2 formation was much less and declined progressively as the concentration of Ca2+ was raised. When the formation of TXA2 was blocked with aspirin or indomethacin, aggregation and release by human platelets were strongest at physiological concentrations of Ca2+. Rabbit platelet responses differed markedly from those of human platelets because close contact of rabbit platelets in a low-Ca2+ medium did not promote TXA2 formation. Rabbit platelet responses were more strongly inhibited by the lack of added Ca2+ in the medium than the responses of human platelets, possibly because rabbit platelets do not contain releasable Ca2+. In all studies of human platelets in media with low concentrations of Ca2+, the additional contribution to platelet responses of TXA2 formed because of close platelet contact should be considered because TXA2 formation is not usually stimulated in this way at physiological concentrations of Ca2+.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

8736132|t|Cytotoxic activity of a methanol extract of Phallusia nigra (Tunicata, Ascidiacea).
8736132|a|Tunicates have been reported to be a rich source of biologically active compounds. In this study, we demonstrate the presence of cytotoxic substances in Phallusia nigra, a common tunicate from Brazilian coastal waters. An extract of tunicate tissue was obtained by homogenizing the visceral organs from 50 specimens in methanol, followed by filtration and concentration in a rotary vacuum evaporator. Finally, the concentrate was partitioned with chloroform to remove lipids. The resulting extract possessed antimitotic and hemolytic activity. The former was demonstrated as a delay in the development of sea urchin eggs by partially inhibiting the process of cleavage (first cleavage, EC50 +/- SEM = 3.44 +/- 0.84 mg/ml). The < 500 molecular fraction of the extract obtained by ultrafiltration also inhibited cell proliferation (the number of viable cells was decreased by 68% with 500 micrograms/ml) and DNA synthesis of T47D cells derived from human breast carcinoma as measured by [3H]-thymidine incorporation (66% of the control value after 24-h incubation with 100 micrograms/ml). Dose-dependent hemolysis obtained with P. nigra extract on mouse erythrocytes had an EC50 +/- SEM = 1.12 +/- 0.02 mg/ml for a 0.5% erythrocyte suspension. Hemolysis could be reduced by pre-incubating the cells with choline-containing phospholipid. Sphingomyelin (40 micrograms/ml) increased the EC50 by two-fold to 2.86 +/- 0.04 mg/ml, but phosphatidylcholine (80 micrograms/ml) did not modify hemolysis.

26066980|t|Molecular contacts of ribose-phosphate backbone of mRNA with human ribosome.
26066980|a|In this work, intimate contacts of riboses of mRNA stretch from nucleotides in positions +3 to +12 with respect to the first nucleotide of the P site codon were studied using cross-linking of short mRNA analogs with oxidized 3'-terminal riboses bound to human ribosomes in the complexes stabilized by codon-anticodon interactions and in the binary complexes. It was shown that in all types of complexes cross-links of the mRNA analogs to ribosomal protein (rp) uS3 occur and the yield of these cross-links does not depend on the presence of tRNA and on sequences of the mRNA analogs. Site of the mRNA analogs cross-linking in rp uS3 was mapped to the peptide in positions 55-64 that is located away from the mRNA binding site. Additionally, in complexes with P site-bound tRNA, riboses of mRNA nucleotides in positions +4 to +7 cross-linked to the C-terminal tail of rp uS19 displaying a contact specific to the decoding site of the mammalian ribosome, and tRNA bound at the A site completely blocked this cross-linking. Remarkably, rps uS3 and uS19 were also able to cross-link to the fragment of HCV IRES containing unstructured 3'-terminal part restricted by the AUGC tetraplet with oxidized 3'-terminal ribose. However, no cross-linking to rp uS3 was observed in the 48S preinitiation complex assembled in reticulocyte lysate with this HCV IRES derivative. The results obtained show an ability of rp uS3 to interact with single-stranded RNAs. Possible roles of rp uS3 region 55-64 in the functioning of ribosomes are discussed.

21324713|t|Erythropoietin and hypoxia increase erythropoietin receptor and nitric oxide levels in lung microvascular endothelial cells.
21324713|a|Acute lung exposure to low oxygen results in pulmonary vasoconstriction and redistribution of blood flow. We used human microvascular endothelial cells from lung (HMVEC-L) to study the acute response to oxygen stress. We observed that hypoxia and erythropoietin (EPO) increased erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) gene expression and protein level in HMVEC-L. In addition, EPO dose- and time-dependently stimulated nitric oxide (NO) production. This NO stimulation was evident despite hypoxia induced reduction of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) gene expression. Western blot of phospho-eNOS (serine1177) and eNOS and was significantly induced by hypoxia but not after EPO treatment. However, iNOS increased at hypoxia and with EPO stimulation compared to normal oxygen tension. In accordance with our previous results of NO induction by EPO at low oxygen tension in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and bone marrow endothelial cells, these results provide further evidence in HMVEC-L for EPO regulation of NO production to modify the effects of hypoxia and cause compensatory vasoconstriction.

12598122|t|High-affinity ammonium transporters and nitrogen sensing in mycorrhizas.
12598122|a|Most terrestrial plants live in mutualistic symbiosis with root-infecting mycorrhizal fungi. This association requires a molecular dialogue between the two partners. However, the nature of the chemical signals that induce hyphal differentiation are not well characterized and the mechanisms for signal reception are still unknown. In addition to its role in ammonium scavenging, the Mep2 protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been proposed to act as an ammonium sensor that is essential for pseudohyphal differentiation in response to ammonium limitation. We propose that the high-affinity ammonium transporters from mycorrhizal fungi act in a similar manner to sense the environment and induce, via as-yet-unidentified signal transduction cascades, the switch in the mode of fungal growth observed during the formation of mycorrhiza.

7446527|t|Separation and characterization of the acid lipase and neutral esterases from human liver.
7446527|a|Electrophoresis of human liver homogenates followed by reaction with 4-methylumbelliferyl palmitate reveals the presence of two major electrophoretic forms with esterase (lipase) activity toward this substrate. The two enzymes were isolated and partially purified based on their solubility differences and their relative affinities for the lectin column concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B. Lipase A was particulate with an acidic pH optimum (5.2) and could be solubilized with the non-ionic surfactant Triton X-100. Lipase B was soluble and had a more neutral pH optimum (6.3--6.6). Both forms bound to immobilized concanavalin A and could be specifically eluted. Buffers containing alpha-methylmannoside eluted lipase B, and buffers with alpha-methylmannoside and Triton X-100 eluted lipase A, giving a 22- and 257-fold purification, respectively, over whole-tissue homogenates. Cholesterol oleate, trioleoylglycerol, and 4-methylumbelliferyl palmitate were substrates for solubilized lipase A. Lipase B hydrolyzed 4-methylum-belliferyl palmitate but not trioleoylglycerol or cholesterol oleate. Lipase B was more thermolabile than lipase A, and it was selectively inhibited by diethyl-p-nitrophenyl phosphate at low concentrations. We conclude that lipase A and B are distinctly different enzymes and that they are probably not related polymorphic forms of one another.

2549114|t|Mineralocorticoid effector mechanism of liquorice derivatives in human mononuclear leukocytes.
2549114|a|The mineralocorticoid effector mechanism of glycyrrhetinic acid and of its ester derivative carbenoxolone was evaluated in human mononuclear leukocytes by radioreceptorassay and measurement of intracellular sodium and potassium after incubation of the cells with or without the drugs. The affinity of both compounds for mineralocorticoid receptors in this human model was also compared with that found in kidney cytosol from adrenalectomized rats. Glycyrrhetinic acid possesses a measurable affinity for mineralocorticoid receptors in mononuclear leukocytes, which is 1:3,000 that of aldosterone itself. Carbenoxolone does not bind to the receptors in mononuclear leukocytes, in contrast with kidney cytosol where the drugs show a parallel affinity. The mean intracellular content of sodium in mononuclear leukocytes from 7 volunteers was 35% higher (p less than 0.05) after incubation with 3 mumol glycyrrhetinic acid than after incubation with an equivalent amount of carbenoxolone, or in medium alone. The effect of glycyrrhetinic acid was completely reversed by addition of canrenone for the period of incubation. We conclude that the syndrome of pseudohyperaldosteronism from carbenoxolone is thus probably not related to a direct agonist effect of the drug at the level of mineralocorticoid receptors, but that any action must follow in vivo conversion into glycyrrhetinic acid by hydrolysis.

22941064|t|Occurrence of 2-methylthiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid, a condensation product of cysteine and acetaldehyde, in human blood as a consequence of ethanol consumption.
22941064|a|Acetaldehyde is a strongly electrophilic compound that is endogenously produced as a first intermediate in oxidative ethanol metabolism. Its high reactivity towards biogenic nucleophiles has toxicity as a consequence. Acetaldehyde readily undergoes a non-enzymatic condensation reaction and consecutive ring formation with cysteine to form 2-methylthiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (MTCA). For analytical purposes, N-acetylation of MTCA was required for stabilization and to enable its quantification by reversed-phase chromatography combined with electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Qualitative screening of post mortem blood samples with negative blood alcohol concentration (BAC) mostly showed low basal levels of MTCA. In BAC-positive post mortem samples, but not in corresponding urine specimens, strongly increased levels were present. To estimate the association between ethanol consumption and the occurrence of MTCA in human blood, the time curves of BAC and MTCA concentration were determined after a single oral dose of 0.5 g ethanol per kilogram of body weight. The blood elimination kinetics of MTCA was slower than that of ethanol. The peak concentration of MTCA (12.6 mg L(-1)) was observed 4 h after ethanol intake (BAC 0.07‰) and MTCA was still detectable after 13 h. Although intermediary acetaldehyde scavenging by formation of MTCA is interesting from a toxicological point of view, lack of hydrolytic stability under physiological conditions may hamper the use of MTCA as a quantitative marker of acetaldehyde exposure, such as resulting from alcohol consumption.

25645722|t|DNA methylation-based prognosis and epidrivers in hepatocellular carcinoma.
25645722|a|UNLABELLED: Epigenetic deregulation has emerged as a driver in human malignancies. There is no clear understanding of the epigenetic alterations in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and of the potential role of DNA methylation markers as prognostic biomarkers. Analysis of tumor tissue from 304 patients with HCC treated with surgical resection allowed us to generate a methylation-based prognostic signature using a training-validation scheme. Methylome profiling was done with the Illumina HumanMethylation450 array (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA), which covers 96% of known cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) islands and 485,000 CpG, and transcriptome profiling was performed with Affymetrix Human Genome U219 Plate (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) and miRNA Chip 2.0. Random survival forests enabled us to generate a methylation signature based on 36 methylation probes. We computed a risk score of mortality for each individual that accurately discriminated patient survival both in the training (221 patients; 47% hepatitis C-related HCC) and validation sets (n = 83; 47% alcohol-related HCC). This signature correlated with known predictors of poor outcome and retained independent prognostic capacity of survival along with multinodularity and platelet count. The subset of patients identified by this signature was enriched in the molecular subclass of proliferation with progenitor cell features. The study confirmed a high prevalence of genes known to be deregulated by aberrant methylation in HCC (e.g., Ras association [RalGDS/AF-6] domain family member 1, insulin-like growth factor 2, and adenomatous polyposis coli) and other solid tumors (e.g., NOTCH3) and describes potential candidate epidrivers (e.g., septin 9 and ephrin B2). CONCLUSIONS: A validated signature of 36 DNA methylation markers accurately predicts poor survival in patients with HCC. Patients with this methylation profile harbor messenger RNA-based signatures indicating tumors with progenitor cell features.

22387197|t|Glutathione regulates caspase-dependent ceramide production and curcumin-induced apoptosis in human leukemic cells.
22387197|a|Depletion of intracellular glutathione (GSH) is the prime hallmark of the progression of apoptosis. Previously, we reported that curcumin induces reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated depletion of GSH, which leads to caspase-dependent and independent apoptosis in mouse fibroblast cells (F. Thayyullathil et al., Free Radic. Biol. Med.45, 1403-1412, 2008). In this study, we investigated the antileukemic potential of curcumin in vitro, and we further examined the molecular mechanisms of curcumin-induced apoptosis in human leukemic cells. Curcumin suppresses the growth of human leukemic cells via ROS-independent GSH depletion, which leads to caspase activation, inhibition of sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) activity, and induction of ceramide (Cer) generation. Pretreatment of leukemic cells with carbobenzoxy-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethylketone, a universal inhibitor of caspases, abrogates the SMS inhibition and Cer generation, and in turn prevents curcumin-induced cell death. Curcumin treatment of leukemic cells also downregulates the expression of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), phospho-Akt, c-Myc, and cyclin D1. Extracellular supplementation with GSH attenuates curcumin-induced depletion of GSH, caspase-dependent inhibition of SMS, Cer generation, and downregulation of IAPs, whereas, L-D-buthionine sulfoximine, a widely used inhibitor of GSH synthesis, potentiates GSH depletion, Cer generation, and apoptosis induced by curcumin. Taken together, our findings provide evidence suggesting for the first time that GSH regulates caspase-dependent inhibition of SMS activity, Cer generation, and apoptosis induced by curcumin in human leukemic cells.

28820319|t|A-to-I RNA editing - thinking beyond the single nucleotide.
28820319|a|Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing is a conserved process, which is performed by ADAR enzymes. By changing nucleotides in coding regions of genes and altering codons, ADARs expand the cell's protein repertoire. This function of the ADAR enzymes is essential for human brain development. However, most of the known editing sites are in non-coding repetitive regions in the transcriptome and the purpose of editing in these regions is unclear. Recent studies, which have shown that editing levels of transcripts vary between tissues and developmental stages in many organisms, suggest that the targeted RNA and ADAR editing are both regulated. We discuss the implications of these findings, and the possible role of RNA editing in innate immunity.

23038646|a|SCOPE: Green tea has been shown to ameliorate symptoms of metabolic syndrome in vivo. The effects could be due, in part, to modulation of postprandial blood glucose levels. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the effect of coadministration of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG, 100 mg/kg, i.g.) on blood glucose levels following oral administration of common corn starch (CCS), maltose, sucrose, or glucose to fasted CF-1 mice. We found that cotreatment with EGCG significantly reduced postprandial blood glucose levels after administration of CCS compared to control mice (50 and 20% reduction in peak blood glucose levels and blood glucose area under the curve, respectively). EGCG had no effect on postprandial blood glucose following administration of maltose or glucose, suggesting that EGCG may modulate amylase-mediated starch digestion. In vitro, EGCG noncompetitively inhibited pancreatic amylase activity by 34% at 20 μM. No significant change was induced in the expression of two small intestinal glucose transporters (GLUT2 and SGLT1). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that EGCG acutely reduces postprandial blood glucose levels in mice when coadministered with CCS and this may be due in part to inhibition of α-amylase. The relatively low effective dose of EGCG makes a compelling case for studies in human subjects.

3159505|t|Participation of endogenous catecholamines in the regulation of left ventricular mass in progeny of hypertensive parents.
3159505|a|To investigate whether adrenergic activity is a determinant of left ventricular hypertrophy in human hypertension, in each of 10 normotensive subjects with two hypertensive parents we have examined the relationship between changes in echocardiographic parameters of left ventricular anatomy and those in circulating catecholamine levels induced by three, 3 week periods of different sodium and potassium intakes. A high sodium-normal potassium regimen induced a significant reduction in upright plasma norepinephrine (from 599 +/- 89 to 379 +/- 45 pg/ml, p less than .01) and in posterior wall (PWT) and interventricular septal (IVST) thickness, as well as in the left ventricular mass index (LVMi). Changes in upright plasma norepinephrine concentrations correlated with those in IVST (r = .822, p less than .01) and in LVMi (r = .833, p less than .01). A low sodium-normal potassium diet resulted in increases in supine and upright plasma norepinephrine levels (from 356 +/- 44 to 488 +/- 89 pg/ml, p less than .001; and from 565 +/- 42 to 744 +/- 33 pg/ml, p less than .01) as well as increases in IVST and LVMi (from 97 +/- 7 to 107 +/- 7 g/m2, p less than .001). The changes in norepinephrine levels in supine and upright subjects correlated with changes in IVST (r = .836, p less than .01 and r = .796, p less than .01) and in LVMi (r = .931, p less than .001 and r = .947, p less than .001). No significant change in plasma catecholamine concentrations or in PWT, IVST, or LVMi was detected after a low sodium-high potassium regimen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

8954935|t|Human chorionic gonadotropin induces nitric oxide synthase mRNA in mouse peritoneal macrophages.
8954935|a|We examined the effects of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) on the production of nitric oxide (NO) by mouse peritoneal macrophages. hCG had no effect on NO synthesis by itself, whereas recombinant interferon-gamma (rIFN-gamma) alone had modest activity. When hCG was used in combination with rIFN-gamma, there was a marked cooperative induction of NO synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. The optimal effect of hCG on NO synthesis was shown at 6 h after treatment with rIFN-gamma. This increase in NO synthesis was reflected as increased amount of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) mRNA. NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, and arginase inhibited rIFN-gamma-plus-hCG-induced NO production. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that hCG activates expression of iNOS mRNA in mouse peritoneal macrophages accompanied by NO accumulation via pathway dependent on L-arginine in the culture medium.

2011915|t|Muscle bioenergetic impairment in hyperthyroid man: a study by 31P NMR spectroscopy.
2011915|a|Phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to investigate muscle bioenergetics in 9 hyperthyroid patients who were compared with 9 normal subjects. Using the thenar muscle group as reference, the inorganic phosphate, phosphocreatine and intracellular pH were calculated at rest, during aerobic exercise (0.13 w) and post-exercise recovery. No difference was found at rest. After 5 min of exercise, the hyperthyroid patients exhibited a more important phosphocreatine depletion (41.2 +/- 8.2 vs 31.1% +/- 6.5, p less than 0.02) and a larger pH fall (6.65 +/- 0.04 vs 7.01 +/- 0.10, p less than 0.001) than the control subjects. The phosphocreatine recovery rate was not significantly different in hyperthyroid patients and control subjects. These results suggest that exercise requires more ATP in hyperthyroid patients than in normal subjects and that there is excessive dependence on glycolytic metabolism for ATP synthesis in hyperthyroidism. Phosphocreatine resynthesis, reflecting the oxidative metabolism, is not increased. These metabolic disturbances could also supply a partial explanation to the frequent exercise intolerance in hyperthyroid patients.

14502577|t|VAChT-Cre. Fast and VAChT-Cre.Slow: postnatal expression of Cre recombinase in somatomotor neurons with different onset.
14502577|a|The cholinergic gene locus (CGL) consists of the genes encoding the choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT). To establish a cholinergic-specific Cre-expressing mouse, we constructed a transgene expression vector (VAChT-Cre) with 11.3 kb human CGL in which a Cre-IRES-EGFP unit was inserted in the VAChT open reading frame. The activity of Cre, whose expression was driven by the VAChT promoter, was examined by crossing a reporter mouse (CAG-CAT-Z) in which expression of LacZ is activated upon Cre-mediated recombination. Transgenic lines with the VAChT-Cre construct displayed the restricted Cre expression in a subset of cholinergic neurons in the somatomotor nuclei and medial habenular nucleus, but absent in visceromotor and other central and peripheral cholinergic neurons. Cre expression was first observed at postnatal day 7 and later detected in approximately 40-60% of somatomotor neurons. Based on the onset of Cre expression, we generated two mouse lines (two alleles; VAChT-Cre. Fast and VAChT-Cre.Slow) in which Cre expression reaches maximal levels fast and slow, respectively. The use of VAChT-Cre mice should allow us to deliver Cre to a subset of postnatal motor neurons, thereby bypassing lethality and facilitating analysis of gene function in adult motor neurons.

24787569|t|Human trabecular meshwork sphingolipid and ceramide profiles and potential latent fungal commensalism.
24787569|a|PURPOSE: We determined the profiles of sphingomyelin, sphingoid base, sphingoid base-1-phosphate, and ceramide, and their quantitative differences between control and glaucomatous trabecular meshwork (TM) derived from human donors. METHODS: Control and primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) TM samples were collected from cadaver donors. In addition, POAG TM surgical specimens also were procured. Lipid extraction was performed using suitable modifications of the Bligh and Dyer method. Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford's method. Lipids, identified using standardized class-specific lipid mass spectrometry, were quantified using a two-step ratiometric process. Gomori methenamine silver (GMS) staining was performed for detection of presence of Fusarium in the anterior eye tissue sections. PCR analyses were performed for detection of Fusarium species in the donor TM samples. RESULTS: Several species of sphingomyelin, sphingoid base, sphingoid base-1-phosphate, and ceramide were common between control and POAG TM. Only a subset of species in some of these classes were identified uniquely either in controls or in POAG TM. Several lipid species of fungal origin (many from Fungi imperfecti, Fusarium species) were found to be common between control and POAG TM. The GMS staining and PCR analyses showed presence of DNA belonging to Fusarium species suggesting latent commensalism. CONCLUSIONS: Most sphingolipids and ceramides (except a few unique to a specific donor TM group) were found to be common in the control and POAG TM. Latent commensalism by Fusarium was suggested by identification of Fusarium-specific lipids, which was supported further by PCR amplification and sequencing of DNA.

3191996|t|Phorbol ester stimulates the synthesis of sphingomyelin in NIH 3T3 cells. A diminished response in cells transformed with human A-raf carrying retrovirus.
3191996|a|The tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) stimulated the synthesis of sphingomyelin (CerPCho) from a [14C]choline-labelled phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) pool in NIH 3T3 cells. Maximal stimulation (68%) of CerPCho synthesis, accompanied by an increase (38%) in its cellular content, required only 2 nM TPA. Higher concentrations of TPA (2-100 nM) had progressively less effect on CerPCho synthesis which correlated with increased hydrolysis of precursor PtdCho. In cells transformed with human or mouse A-raf carrying retroviruses TPA-stimulated PtdCho hydrolysis, but not CerPCho synthesis, suggesting independent regulation of these processes by the TPA-stimulated signal transduction system.

25795667|t|Virucidal effect of cold atmospheric gaseous plasma on feline calicivirus, a surrogate for human norovirus.
25795667|a|Minimal food-processing methods are not effective against foodborne viruses, such as human norovirus (NV). It is important, therefore, to explore novel nonthermal technologies for decontamination of foods eaten fresh, minimally processed and ready-to-eat foods, and food contact surfaces. We studied the in vitro virucidal activity of cold atmospheric gaseous plasma (CGP) against feline calicivirus (FCV), a surrogate of NV. Factors affecting the virucidal activity of CGP (a so-called radio frequency atmospheric pressure plasma jet) were the plasma generation power, the exposure time and distance, the plasma feed gas mixture, and the virus suspension medium. Exposure to 2.5-W argon (Ar) plasma caused a 5.55 log10 unit reduction in the FCV titer within 120 s. The reduction in the virus titer increased with increasing exposure time and decreasing exposure distance. Of the four plasma gas mixtures studied (Ar, Ar plus 1% O2, Ar plus 1% dry air, and Ar plus 0.27% water), Ar plus 1% O2 plasma treatment had the highest virucidal effect: more than 6.0 log10 units of the virus after 15 s of exposure. The lowest virus reduction was observed with Ar plus 0.27% water plasma treatment (5 log10 unit reduction after 120 s). The highest reduction in titer was observed when the virus was suspended in distilled water. Changes in temperature and pH and formation of H2O2 were not responsible for the virucidal effect of plasma. The oxidation of viral capsid proteins by plasma-produced reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in the solution was thought to be responsible for the virucidal effect. In conclusion, CGP exhibits virucidal activity in vitro and has the potential to combat viral contamination in foods and on food preparation surfaces.

18220699|t|Oxidative stress as a regulator of murine atherosclerosis.
18220699|a|Altered cellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and/or reactive nitrogen species (RNS) is a ubiquitous feature of human disease. Vascular oxidative stress is a unifying area of research in atherosclerosis and aging. While elevated levels of ROS, especially oxygen radicals (O2-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), induce cellular apoptosis, low levels play an important role in cell signaling [1,2]. Reactive species from a variety of sources further play an important role in plaque disruption partly through lipid oxidation, low-density lipoprotein oxidation nitration, and signaling [3-6].

20661279|t|Genomic binding profiling of the fission yeast stress-activated MAPK Sty1 and the bZIP transcriptional activator Atf1 in response to H2O2.
20661279|a|BACKGROUND: The evolutionally conserved MAPK Sty1 and bZIP transcriptional activator Atf1 are known to play a pivotal role in response to the reactive oxygen species in S. pombe. However, it is unclear whether all of the H(2)O(2)-induced genes are directly regulated by the Sty1-Atf1 pathway and involved in growth fitness under H(2)O(2)-induced stress conditions. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we present the study on ChIP-chip mapping of the genomic binding sites for Sty1, Atf1, and the Atf1's binding partner Pcr1; the genome-wide transcriptional profiling of the atf1 and pcr1 strains in response to H(2)O(2); and the phenotypic assessment of approximately 90 Atf1/Pcr1-bound or unbound genes for growth fitness under H(2)O(2) conditions. ChIP-chip analysis shows that Atf1 and Pcr1 binding sites are overlapped in the genome and constitutively present before H(2)O(2) stress. On the other hand, Sty1 recruitment primarily occurs at the Atf1/Pcr1 binding sites and is induced by H(2)O(2). We found that Atf1/Pcr1 is clearly responsible for the high-level transcriptional response to H(2)O(2). Furthermore, phenotypic assessment indicates that among the H(2)O(2)-induced genes, Atf1/Pcr1-bound genes exhibit a higher likelihood of functional requirement for growth fitness under the stress condition than the Atf1/Pcr1-unbound genes do. Notably, we found that the Atf1/Pcr1-bound genes regardless of their responsiveness to H(2)O(2) show a high probability of requirement for growth fitness. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Together, our analyses on global mapping of protein binding sites, genome-wide transcriptional profiling, and phenotypic assessment provide insight into mechanisms for global transcriptional regulation by the Sty1-Atf1 pathway in response to H(2)O(2)-induced reactive oxygen species.

23542447|t|Molecular mechanisms of superoxide production by complex III: a bacterial versus human mitochondrial comparative case study.
23542447|a|In this mini review, we briefly survey the molecular processes that lead to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by the respiratory complex III (CIII or cytochrome bc1). In particular, we discuss the "forward" and "reverse" electron transfer pathways that lead to superoxide generation at the quinol oxidation (Qo) site of CIII, and the components that affect these reactions. We then describe and compare the properties of a bacterial (Rhodobacter capsulatus) mutant enzyme producing ROS with its mitochondrial (human cybrids) counterpart associated with a disease. The mutation under study is located at a highly conserved tyrosine residue of cytochrome b (Y302C in R. capsulatus and Y278C in human mitochondria) that is at the heart of the quinol oxidation (Qo) site of CIII. Similarities of the major findings of bacterial and human mitochondrial cases, including decreased catalytic activity of CIII, enhanced ROS production and ensuing cellular responses and damages, are remarkable. This case illustrates the usefulness of undertaking parallel and complementary studies using biologically different yet evolutionarily related systems, such as α-proteobacteria and human mitochondria. It progresses our understanding of CIII mechanism of function and ROS production, and underlines the possible importance of supra-molecular organization of bacterial and mitochondrial respiratory chains (i.e., respirasomes) and their potential disease-associated protective roles.

10608822|t|Characterization of recombinant human endothelial nitric-oxide synthase purified from the yeast Pichia pastoris.
10608822|a|Human endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) was expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, making use of the highly inducible alcohol oxidase promoter. The recombinant protein constituted approximately 3% of total protein and was largely soluble (>75%). About 1 mg of purified eNOS was obtained from 100-ml yeast cell cultures by affinity chromatography of crude cell supernatants. The purified enzyme had a V(max) of 192 +/- 18 nmol of L-citrulline x mg(-1) x min(-1), had a K(m) for L-arginine of 3.9 +/- 0.2 microM, and showed an absolute requirement for tetrahydrobiopterin (H(4)biopterin). NADPH oxidase activity was 136 +/- 9 and 342 +/- 24 nmol x mg(-1) x min(-1) in the absence and presence of 0.1 mM L-arginine, respectively, and not affected by H(4)biopterin. The protein contained 0.56 +/- 0.06 equivalents of FAD and 0.79 +/- 0.08 equivalents of FMN. On-line gel filtration/inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that both iron (0.80 +/- 0.09 mol/subunit) and zinc (0.43 +/- 0.03 mol/subunit) were bound to the enzyme. Graphite furnace-atomic absorption spectroscopy yielded a value for bound iron of 0.84 +/- 0.04 mol/subunit. The absorbance of the enzyme at 398 nm implied a heme content of 0.85 +/- 0.09 mol/subunit, and the high pressure liquid chromatography heme assay gave an estimate of 0.71 +/- 0.02 mol heme/subunit. Gel permeation chromatography yielded one single peak with a Stokes radius of 6.62 +/- 0.7 nm, indicating that the native protein is dimeric. Upon low temperature gel electrophoresis the untreated protein appeared mainly as a monomer (88 +/- 3%), but pretreatment with H(4)biopterin and L-arginine led to a pronounced shift toward dimers (77 +/- 4%). Thus, in contrast to bovine eNOS (List, B. M., Klösch, B., Völker, C., Gorren, A. C. F., Sessa, W. C., Werner, E. R., Kukovetz, W. R., Schmidt, K., and Mayer, B. (1997) Biochem.

3719609|t|Ouabain binding and inotropy in acute potassium depletion in guinea pigs.
3719609|a|In hypokalaemia the incidence of cardiac toxicity with digitalis is increased, possibly through changes in the affinity or capacity of the digitalis receptor in the heart. Previous studies have reported an increased ouabain binding capacity or Na+-K+ ATPase activity after hypokalaemia in human erythrocytes and rabbit and guinea pig hearts and no change or decreases in rabbit or rat skeletal muscles with no changes in ouabain affinity. The present study determined (a) the effect of potassium on 3H-ouabain binding to normokalaemic guinea pig cardiac cell membranes, (b) the effect of acute hypokalaemia induced by a potassium deficient diet for 14-18 days in guinea pigs on 3H-ouabain binding to erythrocytes and cardiac and skeletal muscle homogenates, and (c) ouabain induced inotropy in isolated contracting guinea pig left atria, right ventricular papillary muscles, and soleus muscle strips from normokalaemic and hypokalaemic guinea pigs. 3H-ouabain binds to cardiac cell membranes in the presence of magnesium and inorganic phosphate with an affinity (KD value) of 1.13 X 10(-7) mol X litre-1. Potassium decreased this affinity without changing the binding capacity. Erythrocytes and heart muscle homogenates showed the same affinity as cardiac cell membranes, whereas soleus muscle homogenates had a higher affinity for ouabain (KD 5.1 X 10(-8) mol X litre-1). After hypokalaemia, the ouabain affinity did not change in any tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

21712061|t|Protective activity of the Uncaria tomentosa extracts on human erythrocytes in oxidative stress induced by 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) and catechol.
21712061|a|The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the ethanolic and aqueous extracts of Uncaria tomentosa on human erythrocytes and additionally the assessment of protective effect of these extracts on hemolysis induction, hemoglobin oxidation, and changes in the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation, which were provoked by selected xenobiotics, i.e. 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) and catechol. All tested extracts, even at a very high concentration of 500 μg/ml were not toxic to the erythrocytes because they did not cause lipid peroxidation, increase methemoglobin and ROS levels nor provoked hemolysis. The results of this study also revealed protective effect of extracts of U. tomentosa. The extracts studied depleted the extent of hemoglobin oxidation and lipid peroxidation as well as decreased the level of ROS and hemolysis, which was provoked by 2,4-DCP. No protective activity of the extracts against catechol action, which is a precursor of semiquinones in cell was found. A difference in the effect of the extracts studied was observed. Ethanol-based extracts revealed more pronounced ability to inhibit oxidation processes in human erythrocytes.

18314329|t|Antioxidant capacity of BO-653, 2,3-dihydro-5-hydroxy-4,6-di-tert-butyl-2,2-dipentylbenzofuran, and uric acid as evaluated by ORAC method and inhibition of lipid peroxidation.
18314329|a|The role of radical-scavenging antioxidant against oxidative stress has received much attention. The antioxidant capacity has been assessed by various methods. Above all, oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) has been frequently employed [Prior et.al., J. Agric. Food Chem.2005, 53, 4290]. In the present study, the antioxidant capacity of 2,3-dihydro-5-hydroxy-4,6-di-tert-butyl-2,2-dipentylbenzofuran (BO-653) and uric acid was assessed by ORAC method using pyranine as a reference probe and compared with that against lipid peroxidation of human plasma. It was found that BO-653 was assessed to be much less potent than uric acid by ORAC method, whereas BO-653 exerted much higher antioxidant activity than uric acid against plasma lipid peroxidation. The reason for such discrepancy is discussed. The results suggest that ORAC method is suitable for the assessment of free radical scavenging capacity, but not for the assessment of antioxidant capacity against lipid peroxidation in plasma.

8611752|t|A new enzymatic method for the measurement of creatinine involving a novel ATP-dependent enzyme, N-methylhydantoin amidohydrolase.
8611752|a|A new enzymatic method for the measurement of serum and urine creatinine is described. The method is based on a novel microbial creatinine degradation pathway via N-methylhydantoin [Shimizu et al., Clin. Chim. Acta, 185, 241-252 (1989)]. By using two novel enzymes, N-methylhydantoin amidohydrolase and N-carbamoylsarcosine amidohydrolase, as key enzymes, coupled with a colorimetric procedure for hydrogen peroxide detection, the creatinine level can be measured. The results obtained for human serum and urine show good correlation with those obtained by a standard chemical method based on the Jaffe reaction. The new method is simple and specific, and shows excellent sensitivity and reliability.

1321051|t|Effects of novel uracil analogs on proliferation and differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells.
1321051|a|Twenty-seven novel nucleobases and nucleosides were synthesized by structural modification of uracil, and their effects on growth and differentiation of human myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells were examined. Some of the compounds inhibited the growth of HL-60 effectively. The nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT)-reducing activities of cells treated with the concentrations of these compounds for 50% inhibition of growth were compared. TI-66 (2,4-dibenzyl-6-fluoro-7,7,8,8-tetramethyl-cis-2,4-diazabicyclo-[4.2.0] octane-3,5-dione) was the most effective inducer of NBT-reducing activity and morphological differentiation of HL-60 cells into cells of the myelomonocytic lineage. TI-66 was also effective for induction of differentiation of another human myelogenous leukemia cell line, ML-1 cells, but not for differentiation of human erythroid leukemia K562 or HEL cells, or monocytic U937 cells. The effect of TI-66 in inducing differentiation of HL-60 cells was additive or more than additive in combination with retinoic acid or vitamin D3. Adenine or hypoxanthine alone induced NBT-reducing activity of the cells, and at suboptimal concentrations these compounds enhanced the effect of TI-66, but the enhanced NBT-reducing activities did not exceed the maximal activity induced by TI-66 alone. Simultaneous treatment of HL-60 cells with hypoxanthine reduced the growth inhibition by TI-66 alone. TI-66 was about 150 times more potent on a molar basis than adenine in inducing differentiation of HL-60 cells. These results suggest that nucleobase analogs such as TI-66 should be useful for differentiation therapy of some types of myelogenous leukemia.

23996121|t|Enhancement of human thyrotropin synthesis by sodium butyrate addition to serum-free CHO cell culture.
23996121|a|The influence of sodium butyrate (NaBu) on the synthesis of recombinant human thyrotropin (r-hTSH) by CHO cells was investigated for the first time. A volumetric productivity of ~10 μg hTSH/mL was repeatedly obtained, with a 3.3-fold increase over a control culture carried out in the absence of NaBu. Since NaBu can induce CHO cell apoptosis and cell growth arrest, the increase in specific productivity was even higher, i.e., ca. 5-fold. Analysis of the N-glycan composition of r-hTSH obtained with the addition of NaBu to the culture medium showed an approximately 12 % increase in the amount of sialic acid, as well as in total carbohydrate, partly due to the increase in the site occupancy from 2.77 to 2.93 glycans per mole of hTSH. The two hormone preparations were characterized by N-glycan structural analysis, which showed that NaBu increased the bi-antennary structures by ca. 13 % while decreasing the tri-antennary structures by approximately the same amount. The in vivo biological activity and pharmacokinetic behavior (clearance) were found to be similar for the two hormone preparations.

8843144|t|High-performance liquid chromatographic assay for the quantitation of L-arginine in human plasma.
8843144|a|L-Arginine is metabolized to nitric oxide by nitric oxide synthase, and abnormalities in nitric oxide production have been implicated in the pathogenesis of some diseases involving the vasculature. Thus, there has been interest in the effects of pharmacologic doses of L-arginine in patients with cardiovascular and renal diseases. To study the disposition of exogenous doses, an HPLC method was developed to analyze plasma samples for L-arginine. The assay involves precolumn derivatization of arginine with naphthalenedicarboxaldehyde and cyanide followed by HPLC with UV detection. Only a simple deproteinization of the plasma samples was required. The derivatized arginine was stable (less than 5% degradation in 20 h), facilitating batch sample processing and analysis in an autosampler. Calibration curves were generated in Ringer's lactate solution instead of plasma to correct for endogenous plasma L-arginine. Recovery in plasma, compared to Ringer's solution (n = 4), was 103%. Mean intraday assay precision (n = 6), expressed as coefficient of variation, was 3.4%. Interassay precision (n = 6) was 7%. The assay was applied for the quantitation of L-arginine in plasma samples from a normal subject who had been given a single oral (10 g) and a single intravenous dose (30 g) of exogenous L-arginine.

4750439|a|In studies on seven anephric patients, glucose and insulin administration before hemodialysis produced a significant reduction in plasma potassium concentration (mean reduction = 1.3, 1.7, and 1.4 meq/liter at 60, 120, and 180 min, respectively) which was accompanied by a significant and sustained reduction in plasma aldosterone concentration. There was a significant correlation between plasma aldosterone and plasma potassium concentration (r = +0.74, P < 0.001) and between changes in the concentration of plasma aldosterone occurring in individual patients and the corresponding changes in plasma potassium concentration (r = +0.52, P < 0.01). There was no significant change in plasma sodium concentration, and plasma corticoid concentration, which was monitored as an index of ACTH elaboration, was reduced at 60 min but increased subsequently as symptoms attributable to hypoglycemia were observed. These studies demonstrate that plasma aldosterone concentration can be modulated acutely by transitory changes in plasma potassium concentration without a change in potassium balance. The effect of glucose and insulin administration on intracellular potassium in the adrenal cortex is uncertain, and although increased net movement of potassium into cells is the presumptive mechanism of the reduction in plasma potassium concentration, whether the potassium content of the adrenal cortex may have increased or decreased or remained essentially unchanged, cannot be inferred from our data.

23442857|t|Nicotinic receptor transduction zone: invariant arginine couples to multiple electron-rich residues.
23442857|a|Gating of the muscle-type acetylcholine receptor (AChR) channel depends on communication between the ACh-binding site and the remote ion channel. A key region for this communication is located within the structural transition zone between the ligand-binding and pore domains. Here, stemming from β-strand 10 of the binding domain, the invariant αArg209 lodges within the hydrophobic interior of the subunit and is essential for rapid and efficient channel gating. Previous charge-reversal experiments showed that the contribution of αArg209 to channel gating depends strongly on αGlu45, also within this region. Here we determine whether the contribution of αArg209 to channel gating depends on additional anionic or electron-rich residues in this region. Also, to reconcile diverging findings in the literature, we compare the dependence of αArg209 on αGlu45 in AChRs from different species, and compare the full agonist ACh with the weak agonist choline. Our findings reveal that the contribution of αArg209 to channel gating depends on additional nearby electron-rich residues, consistent with both electrostatic and steric contributions. Furthermore, αArg209 and αGlu45 show a strong interdependence in both human and mouse AChRs, whereas the functional consequences of the mutation αE45R depend on the agonist. The emerging picture shows a multifaceted network of interdependent residues that are required for communication between the ligand-binding and pore domains.

22589465|t|Cytosolic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases interact with phospholipase Dδ to transduce hydrogen peroxide signals in the Arabidopsis response to stress.
22589465|a|Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced in plants under various stress conditions and serve as important mediators in plant responses to stresses. Here, we show that the cytosolic glycolytic enzymes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases (GAPCs) interact with the plasma membrane-associated phospholipase D (PLDδ) to transduce the ROS hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) signal in Arabidopsis thaliana. Genetic ablation of PLDδ impeded stomatal response to abscisic acid (ABA) and H(2)O(2), placing PLDδ downstream of H(2)O(2) in mediating ABA-induced stomatal closure. To determine the molecular link between H(2)O(2) and PLDδ, GAPC1 and GAPC2 were identified to bind to PLDδ, and the interaction was demonstrated by coprecipitation using proteins expressed in Escherichia coli and yeast, surface plasmon resonance, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation. H(2)O(2) promoted the GAPC-PLDδ interaction and PLDδ activity. Knockout of GAPCs decreased ABA- and H(2)O(2)-induced activation of PLD and stomatal sensitivity to ABA. The loss of GAPCs or PLDδ rendered plants less responsive to water deficits than the wild type. The results indicate that the H(2)O(2)-promoted interaction of GAPC and PLDδ may provide a direct connection between membrane lipid-based signaling, energy metabolism and growth control in the plant response to ROS and water stress.

15142888|t|Sodium butyrate sensitizes TRAIL-mediated apoptosis by induction of transcription from the DR5 gene promoter through Sp1 sites in colon cancer cells.
15142888|a|Sodium butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid naturally present in the human colon, is able to induce cell cycle arrest, differentiation and apoptosis in various cancer cells. Sodium butyrate is most probably related to the inhibition of deacetylases leading to hyperacetylation of chromatin components such as histones and non-histone proteins and to alterations in gene expression. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that sodium butyrate selectively up-regulated DR5 but had no effect on the expression of the other TNF-alpha-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor, DR4. Sodium butyrate-induced expression of DR5 involves the putative Sp1 site within the DR5 promoter region. Using a combination of the electrophoretic mobility shift assay and the luciferase reporter assay, we found that a specific Sp1 site (located at -195 bp relative to the transcription start site) is required for sodium butyrate-mediated activation of the DR5 promoter. When HCT116 cells were incubated with sodium butyrate and TRAIL, enhanced TRAIL-mediated apoptosis was observed. The enhanced apoptosis was measured by fluorescent activated cell sorting analysis, DNA fragmentation, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, down-regulation of XIAP and caspase activity. Taken together, the present studies suggest that sodium butyrate may be an effective sensitizer of TRAIL-induced apoptosis.

23178658|t|Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium knowlesi: cloning, expression and functional analysis of 1-Cys peroxiredoxin.
23178658|a|Malaria parasites like other aerobes need to detoxify the reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are mainly produced from hemoglobin degradation in the food vacuole. Since Plasmodium lacks catalase and genuine glutathione peroxidase, they are highly dependent on peroxiredoxins (Prxs) and superoxide dismutases for ROS detoxification. Prxs are protective antioxidant enzymes that act through reduction of hydrogen peroxides. In recent years, several studies have been done on Prx family of human malaria parasites mainly on Plasmodium falciparum but not much on the other human malaria species. In this study 1-Cys peroxiredoxin (1-Cys-Prx) from Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium knowlesi were cloned and characterized. The complete genes coding for 1-Cys-Prx of P. vivax (Pv1-Cys-Prx) and P. knowlesi (Pk1-Cys-Prx) were PCR amplified and the recombinant proteins were produced by heterologous over-expression in Escherichia coli. Both recombinant proteins showed antioxidant activity with the mixed function oxidation assay. Using specific polyclonal antibodies, it was indicated that Pv1-Cys-Prx and Pk1-Cys-Prx are expressed in the cytoplasm of the parasite. Altogether, the results suggested that 1-Cys-Prxs protect the parasites from oxidative damages.

16198231|t|Procyanidin B2 has anti- and pro-oxidant effects on metal-mediated DNA damage.
16198231|a|Procyanidin B2 (epicatechin-(4beta-8)-epicatechin), which is present in grape seeds, apples, and cacao beans, has antioxidant properties. We investigated the mechanism of preventive action of procyanidin B2 against oxidative DNA damage in human cultured cells and isolated DNA. Procyanidin B2 inhibited the formation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) in the human leukemia cell line HL-60 treated with an H2O2-generating system. In contrast, a high concentration of procyanidin B2 increased the formation of 8-oxodG in HL-60 cells. Experiments with calf thymus DNA also revealed that procyanidin B2 decreased 8-oxodG formation by Fe(II)/H2O2, whereas procyanidin B2 induced DNA damage in the presence of Cu(II), and H2O2 extensively enhanced it. An electron spin resonance spin trapping study utilizing 3,3,5,5-tetramethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (M4PO) demonstrated that procyanidin B2 decreased the signal of M4PO-OH from H2O2 and Fe(II), whereas procyanidin B2 enhanced the signal from H2O2 and Cu(II). As an antioxidant mechanism, UV-visible spectroscopy showed that procyanidin B2 chelated Fe(II) at equivalent concentrations. As a pro-oxidant property, we examined DNA damage induced by procyanidin B2, using 32P-labeled DNA fragments obtained from genes relevant to human cancer. Our results raise the possibility that procyanidin B2 exerts both antioxidant and pro-oxidant properties by interacting with H2O2 and metal ions.

3162510|a|The oxidative metabolic burst of stimulated human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) has been evaluated by the measurement of oxygen consumption, chemiluminescence, and oxygen radicals (O2-, H2O2, OH-) derived from activation of the hexose monophosphate shunt (HMPS). PMNs from patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) are shown to lack functional NADPH oxidase and undetectable oxygen radical generation. However, using single cell analysis by flow cytometry and 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin (DCFH) oxidation by H2O2, significant DCFH oxidation by the PMA stimulated CGD PMNs was observed. Furthermore, 1mM potassium cyanide enhanced DCFH oxidation by control and CGD PMNs. DCFH oxidation by cells from an obligate heterozygous mother of an X-linked CGD patient was intermediate. These observations suggest that a PMA induced oxidase enzyme is present in CGD cells.

9480890|t|A dehydrogenase-mediated recycling system of NADPH in plant peroxisomes.
9480890|a|The presence of the two NADP-dependent dehydrogenases of the pentose phosphate pathway has been investigated in plant peroxisomes from pea (Pisum sativum L.) leaves. Both enzymes, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH; EC 1.1.1.49) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH; EC 1.1.1.44), were present in the matrix of leaf peroxisomes, and their kinetic properties were studied. G6PDH and 6PGDH showed a typical Michaelis-Menten kinetic saturation curve, and had specific activities of 12.4 and 29.6 mU/mg protein, respectively. The Km values of G6PDH and 6PGDH for glucose 6-phosphate and for 6-phosphogluconate were 107.3 and 10.2 microM, respectively. Dithiothreitol did not inhibit G6PDH activity. By isoelectric focusing of peroxisomal matrices, the G6PDH activity was resolved into three isoforms with isoelectric points of 5.55, 5.30 and 4.85. The isoelectric point of peroxisomal 6PGDH was 5.10. Immunoblot analyses of peroxisomal matrix with an antibody against yeast G6PDH revealed a single cross-reactive band of 56 kDa. Post-embedment, EM immunogold labelling of G6PDH confirmed that this enzyme was localized in the peroxisomal matrices, the thylakoid membrane and matrix of chloroplasts, and the cytosol. The presence of the two oxidative enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway in plant peroxisomes implies that these organelles have the capacity to reduce NADP+ to NADPH for its re-utilization in the peroxisomal metabolism. NADPH is particularly required for the ascorbate-glutathione cycle, which has been recently demonstrated in plant peroxisomes [Jiménez, Hernández, del Río and Sevilla (1997) Plant Physiol. 114, 275-284] and represents an important antioxidant protection system against H2O2 generated in peroxisomes.

9025303|t|Characterization of a novel eukaryotic ATP/ADP translocator located in the plastid envelope of Arabidopsis thaliana L.
9025303|a|Recently, we have sequenced a cDNA clone from Arabidopsis thaliana L. encoding a novel putative ATP/ADP translocator (AATP1). Here, we demonstrate that the radioactively labeled AATP1 precursor protein, synthesized in vitro, is targeted to envelope membranes of isolated spinach chloroplasts. Antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide of AATP1 recognized a single polypeptide of about 62 kDa in chloroplast inner envelope preparations. The cDNA coding for the AATP1 protein was functionally expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli. In both expression systems, increased rates of ATP transport were observed after reconstitution of the extracted protein into proteoliposomes. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the functional expression of an intrinsic plant membrane protein in E. coli. To yield high rates of ATP transport, proteoliposomes had to be preloaded with ADP, indicating a counter-exchange mode of transport. Carboxyatractyloside did not substantially interfere with ATP transport into proteoliposomes containing the plastidic ATP/ADP translocator. An apparent KM for ATP of 28 microM was determined which is similar to values reported for isolated plastids. The data presented here strongly support the conclusion that AATP1 represents a novel eukaryotic adenylate carrier and that it is identical with the so far unknown plastidic ATP/ADP translocator.

12519758|t|Substrate specificity of human endonuclease III (hNTH1). Effect of human APE1 on hNTH1 activity.
12519758|a|Base excision repair of oxidized pyrimidines in human DNA is initiated by the DNA N-glycosylase/apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) lyase, human NTH1 (hNTH1), the homolog of Escherichia coli endonuclease III (Nth). In contrast to Nth, the DNA N-glycosylase activity of hNTH1 is 7-fold greater than its AP lyase activity when the DNA substrate contains a thymine glycol (Tg) opposite adenine (Tg:A) (Marenstein, D. R., Ocampo, M. T. A., Chan, M. K., Altamirano, A., Basu, A. K., Boorstein, R. J., Cunningham, R. P., and Teebor, G. W. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 21242-21249). When Tg is opposite guanine (Tg:G), the two activities are of the same specific activity as the AP lyase activity of hNTH1 against Tg:A (Ocampo, M. T. A., Chaung, W., Marenstein, D. R., Chan, M. K., Altamirano, A., Basu, A. K., Boorstein, R. J., Cunningham, R. P., and Teebor, G. W. (2002) Mol. Cell. Biol. 22, 6111-6121). We demonstrate here that hNTH1 was inhibited by the product of its DNA N-glycosylase activity directed against Tg:G, the AP:G site. In contrast, hNTH1 was not as inhibited by the AP:A site arising from release of Tg from Tg:A. Addition of human APE1 (AP endonuclease-1) increased dissociation of hNTH1 from the DNA N-glycosylase-generated AP:A site, resulting in abrogation of AP lyase activity and an increase in turnover of the DNA N-glycosylase activity of hNTH1. Addition of APE1 did not abrogate hNTH1 AP lyase activity against Tg:G. The stimulatory protein YB-1 (Marenstein et al.), added to APE1, resulted in an additive increase in both activities of hNTH1 regardless of base pairing. Tg:A is formed by oxidative attack on thymine opposite adenine. Tg:G is formed by oxidative attack on 5-methylcytosine opposite guanine (Zuo, S., Boorstein, R. J., and Teebor, G. W. (1995) Nucleic Acids Res. 23, 3239-3243). It is possible that the in vitro substrate selectivity of mammalian NTH1 and the concomitant selective stimulation of activity by APE1 are indicative of selective repair of oxidative damage in different regions of the genome.

10208496|t|Burst production of superoxide anion in human endothelial cells by lysophosphatidylcholine.
10208496|a|This study examined whether lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC), an atherogenic lipid, may stimulate production of O2*-, in cultured human endothelial cells. Production of O2*- was detected by bis-N-methylacridinium nitrate (lucigenin)-elicited chemiluminescence. LysoPC was found to induce burst production of O2*-, peaked at 2-4 min after the stimulation, in intact endothelial cells. LysoPC also stimulated NADH-dependent production of O2*- in particulate fraction of the cells, and the action of lysoPC was inhibited by diphenyliodonium. The results suggested that lysoPC stimulated production of O2*- partly through membrane-associated NADH-dependent O2*- production systems.

21920358|t|Raloxifene protects cultured human chondrocytes from IL-1β induced damage: a biochemical and morphological study.
21920358|a|It is well known that estrogens are implicated in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis. Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator used in the treatment of osteoporosis, though little is known about the possible effects of raloxifene on cartilage metabolism. The aim of our study was to evaluate the possible in vitro effects of raloxifene in human osteoarthritis chondrocytes cultivated in the presence or absence of Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) (5 ng/ml). The effects of 0.1 μM and 1 μM of raloxifene in the culture medium were assessed using an immuno-enzymatic method for proteoglycans and metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), and the Griess method for nitrite. Gene expression of inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS) was detected by real-time PCR. A morphological analysis was performed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Cell viability was significantly (P<0.01) reduced by the IL-1β, and restored to basal levels by raloxifene at both of the concentrations used. The presence of IL-1 β led to a significant decrease (P<0.01) in proteoglycan levels as well as a significant increase of MMP-3 and NO (P<0.01). When the cells were co-incubated with IL-1β and raloxifene, a significant and dose-dependent increase in proteoglycans and a reduction of MMP-3 and nitric oxide (NO) were detected. iNOS was noticeably expressed in IL-1β stimulated chondrocytes, while raloxifene decreased in a very significant manner the gene expression of iNOS at both of the concentrations used. The results of the biochemical evaluation were confirmed by TEM. Our data suggest that raloxifene may have a potential chondroprotective role in osteoarthritis.

25651816|t|ERO1: A protein disulfide oxidase and H2O2 producer.
25651816|a|Oxidative protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an essential function of eukaryotic cells that requires the relaying of electrons between the proteinaceous components of the pathway. During this process, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) chaperones oxidatively fold their client proteins before endoplasmic reticulum oxireductin 1 (ERO1) oxidase transfers electrons from the reduced PDI to the terminal acceptor, which is usually molecular oxygen and is subsequently reduced to H2O2. ERO1 function is essential for disulfide bond formation in yeast, whereas in mammals its function is compensated for by alternative pathways. ERO1 activity is allosterically and transcriptionally regulated by the ER unfolded protein response (UPR). The ER stress-induced upregulation of ERO1 and other genes contributes to a cell's ability to cope with ER stress as a result of an adaptive homeostatic response, but the stress persists if a "maladaptive UPR" fails to reestablish ER homeostasis. As the oxidative activity of ERO1 is related to the production of H2O2 and consequently burdens cells with potentially toxic reactive oxygen species, deregulated ERO1 activity is likely to impair cell fitness under certain conditions of severe ER stress and may therefore lead to a change from an adaptive to a maladaptive UPR. This review summarizes the evidence of the double-edged sword activity of ERO1 by highlighting its role as a protein disulfide oxidase and H2O2 producer.

15135772|t|Local synthesis and dual actions of progesterone in the nervous system: neuroprotection and myelination.
15135772|a|Progesterone (PROG) is synthesized in the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves. Its direct precursor pregnenolone is either derived from the circulation or from local de novo synthesis as cytochrome P450scc, which converts cholesterol to pregnenolone, is expressed in the nervous system. Pregnenolone is converted to PROG by 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3beta-HSD). In situ hybridization studies have shown that this enzyme is expressed throughout the rat brain, spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) mainly by neurons. Macroglial cells, including astrocytes, oligodendroglial cells and Schwann cells, also have the capacity to synthesize PROG, but expression and activity of 3beta-HSD in these cells are regulated by cellular interactions. Thus, Schwann cells convert pregnenolone to PROG in response to a neuronal signal. There is now strong evidence that P450scc and 3beta-HSD are expressed in the human nervous system, where PROG synthesis also takes place. Although there are only a few studies addressing the biological significance of PROG synthesis in the brain, the autocrine/paracrine actions of locally synthesized PROG are likely to play an important role in the viability of neurons and in the formation of myelin sheaths. The neuroprotective effects of PROG have recently been documented in a murine model of spinal cord motoneuron degeneration, the Wobbler mouse. The treatment of symptomatic Wobbler mice with PROG for 15 days attenuated the neuropathological changes in spinal motoneurons and had beneficial effects on muscle strength and the survival rate of the animals. PROG may exert its neuroprotective effects by regulating expression of specific genes in neurons and glial cells, which may become hormone-sensitive after injury. The promyelinating effects of PROG were first documented in the mouse sciatic nerve and in co-cultures of sensory neurons and Schwann cells. PROG also promotes myelination in the brain, as shown in vitro in explant cultures of cerebellar slices and in vivo in the cerebellar peduncle of aged rats after toxin-induced demyelination. Local synthesis of PROG in the brain and the neuroprotective and promyelinating effects of this neurosteroid offer interesting therapeutic possibilities for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, for accelerating regenerative processes and for preserving cognitive functions during aging.

7935493|t|Differential recruitment of steroid hormone response elements may dictate the expression of the pituitary gonadotropin II beta subunit gene during salmon maturation.
7935493|a|The role of testosterone (T) and 17 beta-estradiol (E2) in the control of chinook salmon gonadotropin II beta subunit (sGTHII beta) gene was examined. Both E2 and T specifically stimulated GTHII beta gene expression in cultured juvenile rainbow trout pituitary cells. 5'-Flanking regions of the sGTHII beta gene linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) expression vector were transfected into these pituitary cells, and cultures were treated with steroid hormones. Estrogen-stimulated CAT activity occurred with constructs containing a 13-base pair estrogen responsive element (ERE) sequence [proximal ERE (pERE)] located at -273 to -260 upstream of its transcriptional start site. Binding specificity of pERE was confirmed by mobility shift and DNA methylation interference assays using the DNA binding domain of the human estrogen receptor. Interestingly, the pERE functioned to derepress the activity of the proximal silencer (pSil) only in the pituitary cells of juvenile trout but not in cells derived from maturing and sexually matured fish. Another potential ERE sequence comprised of three tandemly linked half-ERE palindromes was located from -2736 to -2659 [distal ERE (dERE)] of the sGTHII beta gene. Distal ERE might be responsible for the steroid responsiveness of the longest sGTHII beta/CAT construct (-3500CAT) observed in the pituitary cells of maturing fish. The function of pERE and dERE were further examined in the heterologous HeLa cells by mutagenesis and cotransfection with a rainbow trout estrogen receptor expression vector. Disruption of the palindromic structure of pERE severely impaired its function. When the sequences between pERE and dERE were deleted, a 200-fold increase in CAT activity was observed in response to E2. A model is proposed to describe the regulation of GTHII beta gene expression at different reproductive stages.

15182209|t|Nitric oxide synthase inhibition: therapeutic potential in asthma.
15182209|a|Nitric oxide (NO) is synthesized from L-arginine in the human respiratory tract by enzymes of the NO synthase (NOS) family. Levels of NO in exhaled air are increased in asthma, and measurement of exhaled NO has been advocated as a noninvasive tool to monitor the underlying inflammatory process. However, the relation of NO to disease pathophysiology is uncertain, and in particular the fundamental question of whether it should be viewed primarily as beneficial or harmful remains unanswered. Exogenously administered NO has both bronchodilator and bronchoprotective properties. Although it is unlikely that NO is an important regulator of basal airway tone, there is good evidence that endogenous NO release exerts a protective effect against various bronchoconstrictor stimuli. This response is thought to involve one or both of the constitutive NOS isoforms, endothelial NOS (eNOS) and neuronal NOS (nNOS). Therefore, inhibition of these enzymes is unlikely to be therapeutically useful in asthma and indeed may worsen disease control. On the other hand, the high concentrations of NO in asthma, which are believed to reflect upregulation of inducible NOS (iNOS) by proinflammatory cytokines, may produce various deleterious effects. These include increased vascular permeability, damage to the airway epithelium, and promotion of inflammatory cell infiltration. However, the possible effects of iNOS inhibition on allergic inflammation in asthma have not yet been described and studies in animal models have yielded inconsistent findings. Thus, the evidence to suggest that inhibition of iNOS would be a useful therapeutic strategy in asthma is limited at present. More definitive information will require studies combining agents that potently and specifically target individual NOS isoforms with direct measurement of inflammatory markers.

27481232|t|Protective Effect of Astaxanthin on Vocal Fold Injury and Inflammation Due to Vocal Loading: A Clinical Trial.
27481232|a|OBJECTIVES: Professional voice users, such as singers and teachers, are at greater risk of developing vocal fold injury from excessive use of voice; thus, protection of the vocal fold is essential. One of the most important factors that aggravates injury is the production of reactive oxygen species at the wound site. The purpose of the current study was to assess the effect of astaxanthin, a strong antioxidant, on the protection of the vocal fold from injury and inflammation due to vocal loading. STUDY DESIGN: This study is an institutional review board-approved human clinical trial. METHODS: Ten male subjects underwent a 60-minute vocal loading session and received vocal assessments prior to, immediately after, and 30 minutes postvocal loading (AST(-) status). All subjects were then prescribed 24 mg/day of astaxanthin for 28 days, after which they received the same vocal task and assessments (AST(+) status). Phonatory parameters were compared between both groups. RESULTS: Aerodynamic assessment, acoustic analysis, and GRBAS scale (grade, roughness, breathiness, asthenia, and strain) were significantly worse in the AST(-) status immediately after vocal loading, but improved by 30 minutes after loading. In contrast, none of the phonatory parameters in the AST(+) status were statistically worse, even when measured immediately after vocal loading. No allergic responses or adverse effects were observed after administration of astaxanthin. CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggest that astaxanthin can protect the vocal fold from injury and inflammation caused by vocal loading possibly through the regulation of oxidative stress.

20663290|t|Role of glutathione in augmenting the anticancer activity of pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ).
20663290|a|Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a bacterial redox co-factor and antioxidant, is highly reactive with nucleophilic compounds present in biological fluids. PQQ induced apoptosis in human promonocytic leukemia U937 cells and this was accompanied by depletion of the major cellular antioxidant glutathione and increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Treatment with glutathione (GSH) or N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) did not spare PQQ toxicity but resulted in a 2-5-fold increase in PQQ-induced apoptosis in U937 cells. Cellular GSH levels increased following treatment by NAC alone but were severely depleted by co-treatment with NAC and PQQ. This was accompanied by an increase in intracellular ROS. Alternatively, depletion of glutathione also resulted in increased PQQ cytotoxicity. However, the cells underwent necrosis as evidenced by dual labeling with annexin V and propidium iodide. PQQ-induced cytotoxicity is thus critically regulated by the cellular redox status. An increase in GSH can augment apoptosis and its depletion can switch the mode of cell death to necrosis in the presence of PQQ. Our data suggest that modulation of intracellular GSH can be used as an effective strategy to potentiate cytotoxicity of quinones like PQQ.

19088798|t|Amyloid peptide inhibits ATP release from human erythrocytes.
19088798|a|The oxygen required to meet metabolic needs of all tissues is delivered by the erythrocyte, a small, flexible cell, which, in mammals, is devoid of a nucleus and mitochondria. Despite its simple appearance, this cell has an important role in its own distribution, enabling the delivery of oxygen to precisely meet localized metabolic need. When an erythrocyte enters in a hypoxic area, a signalling pathway is activated within the cell resulting in the release of ATP in amounts adequate to activate purinergic receptors on vascular endothelium, which trigger secretion of nitric oxide and other factors resulting in vasodilatation. Among other mechanisms, binding of deoxyhemoglobin to the cytoplasmic domain of the anion-exchange protein band 3 is probably involved in this pathway. The present study investigates the effect of amyloid beta peptide exposure on this molecular mechanism. We report that deoxygenated human erythrocytes fail to release ATP following 24 h exposure to amyloid beta peptide. Concurrently, amyloid beta peptide induces caspase 3 activation. Preincubation of amyloid beta peptide treated erythrocytes with a specific inhibitor of caspase 3 prevents amyloid-induced caspase 3 activation and restores the erythrocyte's ability to release ATP under deoxygenated conditions. Since the activity of red cell phosphofructokinase, a key step in glycolytic flux, is not modified within the red cell following amyloid peptide exposure, it is likely that ATP release reduction is not dependent on glycolytic flux alterations. It has also been suggested that the heterotrimeric G protein, Gi, and adenylyl cyclase are downstream critical components of the pathway responsible for ATP release. We show that cAMP synthesis and ATP release are not failed in amyloid-peptide-treated erythrocytes in response to incubation with mastoparan 7 or forskolin plus 3-isobutyl-1-methyl xanthine, agents that stimulate cAMP synthesis. In conclusion, these results indicate that amyloid beta peptide inhibits ATP release from deoxygenated erythrocytes by activating red cell caspase 3, suggesting a pathophysiologic role for vascular amyloid peptide in Alzheimer's disease.

25339131|t|Resveratrol protects against arsenic trioxide-induced oxidative damage through maintenance of glutathione homeostasis and inhibition of apoptotic progression.
25339131|a|Arsenic trioxide (As2 O3 ) is commonly used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia and solid tumors. However, the clinical application of the agent is limited by its cyto- and genotoxic effects on normal cells. Thus, relief of As2 O3 toxicity in normal cells is essentially necessary for improvement of As2 O3 -mediated chemotherapy. In this study, we have identified a series of protective effects of resveratrol against As2 O3 -induced oxidative damage in normal human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells. We showed that treatment of HBE cells with resveratrol significantly reduced cellular levels of DNA damage, chromosomal breakage, and apoptosis induced by As2 O3 . The effect of resveratrol against DNA damage was associated with a decreased level of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation in cells treated by As2 O3 , suggesting that resveratrol protects against As2 O3 toxicity via a cellular anti-oxidative stress pathway. Further analysis of the roles of resveratrol demonstrated that it modulated biosynthesis, recycling, and consumption of glutathione (GSH), thereby promoting GSH homeostasis in HBE cells treated by As2 O3 . This was further supported by results showing that resveratrol prevented an increase in the activities and levels of caspases, Fas, Fas-L, and cytochrome c proteins induced by As2 O3 . Our study indicates that resveratrol relieves As2 O3 -induced oxidative damage in normal human lung cells via maintenance of GSH homeostasis and suppression of apoptosis.

8830178|t|Detection of defective 3 beta-hydroxysterol delta 7-reductase activity in cultured human fibroblasts: a method for the diagnosis of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome.
8830178|a|Patients with the autosomal recessive disorder Smith-Lemli-Optiz syndrome (SLO) have recently been shown to have markedly increased tissue levels of certain cholesterol biosynthesis intermediates, most notably 7-dehydrocholesterol. The findings strongly suggest a block in the step that catalyses reduction of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol. The accumulation of 7-dehydrocholesterol can generally easily be detected in serum by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. However, it could not be totally ruled out that SLO patients with less severe enzyme defects could escape detection by this method. A more direct way of diagnosing a defect in 7-dehydrocholesterol reduction would be to assay the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol in cultured fibroblasts from patients with suspected SLO. In the present work, an assay for the conversion of [3H]lathosterol to [3H]cholesterol in cultured human fibroblasts is described. Lathosterol is the immediate precursor of 7-dehydrocholesterol in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway and was chosen for the assay instead of 7-dehydrocholesterol owing to the difficulty in preparation and handling of the latter compound. Fibroblasts from control subjects converted [3H]lathosterol to [3H]cholesterol efficiently, whereas in fibroblasts from SLO patients the conversion did not go beyond 7-dehydrocholesterol. It is concluded that the present method is useful for the diagnosis of SLO.

9299442|t|IL-1 alpha induces inducible nitric oxide synthase in uterine smooth muscle.
9299442|a|In a previous report, we have identified interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) in amniotic fluid of women with premature rupture of the amniotic membrane (PROM), and suggested that this cytokine may play a role in the development of the fetus. To clarify the functional role of amniotic IL-1 alpha, we studied its effect on the induction of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in the uterus. IL-1 alpha administered intraperitoneally to rats induced an increase in the amount of mRNA encoding the macro-phage-type iNOS which was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. NO measurement by NO selective electrode revealed that NO production in the rat and human uterus treated with IL-1 alpha was promoted by the addition of 1 mM L-arginine to the culture medium. These findings suggest that in women with PROM, amniotic IL-1 alpha may reduce uterine contractions, in part, by inducing of iNOS.

3422142|t|Effect of human eosinophil major basic protein on ion transport in dog tracheal epithelium.
3422142|a|Eosinophil major basic protein (MBP) is a granule-associated cytotoxic protein found in sputum and deposited on airway tissues of patients with acute asthma. We therefore studied the effect of human MBP on ion transport in dog tracheal epithelium. We mounted the posterior tracheal membranes of mongrel dogs in Ussing chambers and measured potential differences across the membranes and short-circuit current. Using 22Na+ and 36Cl- as tracers, we determined net ion movements. The addition of MBP (5 X 10(-6) M) to the mucosal, but not to the serosal, side of the membranes produced an increase in short-circuit current from 2.25 +/- 0.19 (mean +/- SE) to 2.78 +/- 0.23 muEq.cm-2h-1 (p less than 0.0001) and in net chloride secretion from 1.57 +/- 0.22 to 2.31 +/- 0.24 muEq.cm-2h-1 (p less than 0.01). There was no change in net sodium movement. Pretreatment with indomethacin (10(-5) M) attenuated, but did not abolish, the increase in short-circuit current. After exposure to MBP, prostaglandin E2 release into the serosal bathing solution increased from 10.0 +/- 4.2 to 17.0 +/- 6.9 ng.cm-2h-1 (p less than 0.05). The results of this study indicate that MBP simulates prostaglandin E2 production and chloride secretion by dog tracheal epithelium. Thus, eosinophils in the airways, through release of MBP, may affect mucociliary clearance by changing the volume and composition of respiratory tract fluid.

1282518|t|Smooth muscle dilatation in the human uterine artery induced by substance P, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, calcitonin gene-related peptide and atrial natriuretic peptide: relation to endothelium-derived relaxing substances.
1282518|a|The relaxatory influences of substance P (SP), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) were investigated in human uterine arteries precontracted by noradrenaline in vitro. SP, VIP, CGRP and ANP all relaxed isolated uterine arteries with intact endothelium. When tested on vessels devoid of their endothelium VIP and SP had no effect on smooth muscular tone, while ANP and CGRP still induced unchanged vasodilatation. These results suggest an involvement of an endothelium-derived relaxing substance in the mechanisms by which VIP and SP induce relaxation of the isolated human uterine artery. On the other hand, ANP and CGRP seem to act on the same vessel preparation in vitro independently of the vascular endothelium. Both addition of noradrenaline and exchange of sodium against potassium in the organ chambers resulted in smooth muscle contraction irrespective of the integrity of the endothelium.

10907960|t|Expression of sodium iodide symporter in metastatic and follicular human thyroid tissues.
10907960|a|Active iodide uptake across the basal membrane mediated by human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS) has been shown to be a process coupled with the flow of sodium. There is still controversy as to the amount of hNIS expression present in different kinds of human thyroid cancer tissues. In this study, we present a 58-year-old women with follicular thyroid carcinoma with vertebra and skull metastases. 201Tl and 5 mCi 131I scans clearly demonstrated the metastatic lesions in the brain of this patient. Thyroid and metastatic tissues were then obtained for this study, which is aimed at comparing the iodide trapping ability in vivo and in vitro of hNIS, and then comparing their expression in both thyroid tissue and metastatic tissues. Polyclonal antibodies to hNIS and competitive RT PCR were used to analyze the symporter protein and mRNA expressed in follicular human thyroid and metastatic tissues. Positive staining of the symporter protein was performed in the follicular thyroid carcinomas, otherwise, the metastatic tissues could not have demonstrated the protein in the staining. Follicular thyroid carcinoma tissues from thyroid were revealed around 5 pg hNIS expressed in follicular thyroid carcinoma tissues from the thyroid. Otherwise, there was almost an absence of hNIS expression in the metastatic tissue. These discrepancies of the expression in hNIS in vivo and in vitro studies need further investigation.

2396352|t|Effects of papaverine on human isolated bladder muscle.
2396352|a|Papaverine is a non-specific smooth muscle relaxant and is thought to act at a site beyond the receptor sites on the cell membrane. In this study the relaxing properties of papaverine were tested in isolated muscle strips from the human bladder dome. In carbachol-induced contractions papaverine, even in high concentrations of 10(-4) mol/l had virtually no effects on peak tension generation, whereas the fading was accelerated and the steady state tension at 30 min. was reduced by about 54%. In contrast, high potassium-induced contractions were relaxed by papaverine in a concentration-dependent way; a concentration of papaverine of 10(-4) mol/l produced full relaxation. These findings might possibly be explained if it is assumed that papaverine blocks calcium ion channels in the cell membrane. However, the observation that rather high concentrations of papaverine were necessary to fully relax high potassium contractions and the fact, that papaverine affects cellular cAMP levels separate this drug from more selective calcium channel blockers. The calcium movements responsible for the peak tension generation in carbachol-induced contractions are obviously not affected by papaverine. Although papaverine had little effect on carbachol-induced contractions in vitro it cannot be excluded that the drug is effective in diseases were non-cholinergic mechanisms are involved.

9443084|t|The role of nitric oxide in the immune response of tuberculosis.
9443084|a|Nitric oxide (NO) formed by the action of inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), reacts with oxygen radical forming reactive nitrogen intermediate (RNI). NO and related RNI have been reported to possess antimycobacterial activity. Macrophages can inhibit the proliferation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by producing NO. In murine models, the ability of macrophages to produce NO can determine the susceptibility of the host to M. tuberculosis and the virulence of M. tuberculosis. However, it is still not clear whether NO is involved in the defense mechanism against M. tuberculosis in humans. We have demonstrated that human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and airway epithelial cells can express iNOS mRNA expression and produce NO production in response to tubercle bacilli stimulation. Furthermore, H37Ra, avirulent strain of M. tuberculosis, induces a larger amount of NO in cultured PBMC than H37Rv, virulent strain, does. There was no difference in NO production between healthy volunteers and patients with tuberculosis. NO production in airway epithelial cells is closely related with IFN gamma concentration. The balance of stimulatory cytokines and inhibitory cytokines for NO production may play a critical role in the defense mechanism against M. tuberculosis considering that NO production is upregulated by IFN gamma, TNF alpha, and IL-1 beta and downregulated by IL-10 and TGF beta. The study of immune response to M. tuberculosis including NO production may give us a better understanding of the pathogenesis of tuberculosis.

25730491|t|Genome sequence-independent identification of RNA editing sites.
25730491|a|RNA editing generates post-transcriptional sequence changes that can be deduced from RNA-seq data, but detection typically requires matched genomic sequence or multiple related expression data sets. We developed the GIREMI tool (genome-independent identification of RNA editing by mutual information; https://www.ibp.ucla.edu/research/xiao/GIREMI.html) to predict adenosine-to-inosine editing accurately and sensitively from a single RNA-seq data set of modest sequencing depth. Using GIREMI on existing data, we observed tissue-specific and evolutionary patterns in editing sites in the human population.

1417839|t|Distribution of GLUT3 glucose transporter protein in human tissues.
1417839|a|To investigate the tissue distribution of the GLUT3 glucose transporter isoform in human tissue we produced affinity purified antibodies to the COOH terminus of the human GLUT3. Both antibodies recognize a specific GLUT3 band in oocytes injected with GLUT3 mRNA but not in those injected with H2O or GLUT1, 2, 4, 5 mRNA. This immunoreactive band in GLUT3 injected oocytes is photolabelled by cytochalasin-B in the presence of L- but not D-glucose indicating that it is a glucose transporter. A high cross reactivity between the human GLUT3 antibodies and a 43 kDa cytoskeletal actin band was identified in all oocyte lysates and many human tissues. However, the specific GLUT3 band could be distinguished from the actin band by carbonate treatment which preferentially solubilized the actin band. Using these antibodies we show that GLUT3 is present as a 45-48 kDa protein in human brain with lower levels detectable in heart, placenta, liver and a barely detectable level in kidney. No GLUT3 was detected in membranes from any of 3 skeletal muscle groups investigated. We conclude that a major role of GLUT3 in humans is as the brain neuronal glucose transporter.

23006987|t|Research progress in the radioprotective effect of superoxide dismutase.
23006987|a|Irradiation from diverse sources is ubiquitous and closely associated with human activity. Radiation therapy (RT), an important component of the multiple radiation origins, contributes significantly to oncotherapy by killing tumor cells. On the other hand, RT can also cause some undesired normal tissue injuries that afflict numerous cancer patients. Although many promising radioprotective agents are emerging, few of them have entered the market successfully due to various limitations. At present, the most accepted hypothesis for the radiation-caused injury involves reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), the unique enzyme responsible for the dismutation of superoxide radicals, is expected to occupy an indispensable position in the treatment of ROS-mediated tissue injuries originating from exposure to radiation. This review focuses on the mechanism of radioprotection by SOD at the tissue or organ level, cellular level, and molecular level, respectively, in order to provide references for further investigation of radiation injury and development of new radioprotectors.

3095016|t|Respiratory gases.
3095016|a|Respiratory gases have access to the human circulation by diffusing through alveolar walls into pulmonary capillaries. Because of this circulatory access, these gases can act like other types of drugs, and can produce effects both locally in the lungs and systemically in distant organs or tissues.

1782840|t|Effects of prenatal cocaine exposure on perinatal morbidity and postnatal growth in the rabbit.
1782840|a|Prenatal cocaine (CC) exposure may result in increased fetal loss, growth retardation, altered neurodevelopment, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). We sought to establish an animal model for prenatal cocaine exposure which (1) would allow us to distinguish the direct effects from the indirect and nutritional effects of the drug, and (2) might be used to address questions of cocaine's toxicity, specifically to the developing respiratory control system. The study design included 38 New Zealand White rabbit does among CC, pair-fed (PF), and free-fed (FF) groups. Miniosmotic pumps were implanted in each doe on day 10 of timed gestation providing continuous subcutaneous administration of either 30 mg/kg/day of cocaine HCl in H2O (CC) or sterile H2O alone (PF and FF). Mean (SEM) plasma cocaine concentration was 1.71 +/- 0.21 mumol/l (519.4 +/- 64.4 ng/ml). Pregnancy outcome compared for incidence of stillbirth, maternal death, spontaneous abortion, and gross malformation among 211 pups was significant only for increased stillbirths among CC pups (18%, p less than 0.04) as compared to PF (6%) and FF pups (7%). External and renal malformation and postnatal weight, crown-rump length, and snout-occiput head circumference for pups aged 4 and 5 days of age did not differ among groups. The direct effects of prenatal cocaine evaluated in our model do not reproduce the altered perinatal outcome observed among humans. However, our results do not determine if physiologic function has been altered. Investigation of the physiologic and pathologic abnormalities that are relevant to this human condition, specifically to the developing respiratory control system, should add clarity to the mechanism of action of cocaine during pregnancy.

7539586|t|Topography of nitric oxide synthesis by localizing constitutive NO synthases in mammalian kidney.
7539586|a|Nitric oxide (NO) is generated from L-arginine by NO synthase (NOS). We have investigated the localization of constitutive NOS isoforms in rat, mouse, guinea pig, rabbit, pig, and human kidney. NADPH diaphorase (NADPH-d) reaction was used for histochemical detection of NOS enzyme activity, neuronal NOS (NOS I) and endothelial NOS (NOS III) were identified by specific antibody, and in situ hybridization was applied for NOS I mRNA detection. Strong presence of NOS I in macula densa (MD), previously detected in rat, was found in all species including humans. Additional NOS I-positive cells of the thick ascending limb (TALH) were defined. A clear-cut distinction between Tamm-Horsfall-protein-positive cells of the TALH and NOS I-positive cells of the TALH was shown. Ultrastructurally, NOS I was located in the cytosol. Intimate spatial relation between NOS I-positive cells and renin-containing preglomerular afferent arteriole suggests an effect of MD-derived NO on the juxtaglomerular granular cells. In the renal vasculature, both NADPH-d and NOS III were located in the endothelium of cortical and medullary vessels, whereas the muscle layer was unreactive. The glomerular arterioles showed stronger labeling in the efferent than in the afferent endothelium, and efferent endothelium selectively contained both NOS I and NOS III. The unique morphology of efferent endothelial cells indicates a particular role for NO in this vessel segment. At the capillary level, only the glomerular tuft showed NOS-positive endothelia. A subpopulation of renal nerves containing NADPH-d and NOS I was found in perivascular connective tissue and near pelvic epithelium. These results demonstrate a wide distribution of two constitutive NOS isoforms in the kidney of various animal species including humans. The distinct location of both isoforms in the cortex confirms that NO plays a crucial role in local glomerular signaling events.

20204285|t|The effect on radioresistance of manganese superoxide dismutase in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
20204285|a|Failure to control nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC) is mainly due to a portion of radioresistant phenotype. Identifying gene targets for radiosensitization is an important strategy in improving anticancer treatments. Exposure of cells to ionizing radiation leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species that are associated with radiation-induced cellular apoptosis and necrosis. The antioxidant enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) catalyzes the dismutation of the superoxide anions into hydrogen peroxide. We reasoned that SOD2 could contribute to the radioresistant phenotype in NPC cells. We compared CNE1 cells with CNE2 cells in radiation character and SOD2 protein. SOD2 gene silencing through the plasmid transfer using a microRNA interference optimized for transcription in NPC cell lines inhibited the radioresistance of human NPC cells. We compared radio-resistant NPC with radiosensitive NPC in SOD2 expression. CNE1 cells and CNE2 cells demonstrated dose-modifying factors at 10% isosurvival of 1.529 and 1. CNE1 cells were 1.94-fold higher than CNE2 cells at SOD2 protein baseline, and CNE1 cells exposed to ionizing radiation demonstrated 1.15- to 1.39-fold increase in SOD2 immunoreactive protein. Radioresistance in CNE1 cells was reduced following expression of miRNA targeting SOD2. Radioresistant tumors (11/23) were SOD2-positive, and 2/46 radiosensitive tumors were SOD2-positive before commencement of radiotherapy. The results presented suggest that SOD2 expression can participate in radioresistance of NPC, being markers of a subset of tumors in which routine radiation treatment failure is likely. Combination of the SOD2 gene silencing therapy and conventional radiotherapy should be attempted to improved cancer therapy for NPC.

9886883|t|Dietary fiber, psyllium, attenuates salt-accelerated hypertension in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats.
9886883|a|OBJECTIVE: Although dietary fiber, psyllium seed husk (psyllium), is known to reduce blood glucose and lipid levels, the effect of psyllium on blood pressure elevation induced by salt ingestion has not been tested in human and rats. We observed the effect of psyllium on salt-accelerated hypertension in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). METHODS: Forty male SHRSP (6 weeks of age) were divided into four groups: a plain laboratory diet (PL) group, groups receiving the PL diet substituted with 3% or 10% of psyllium, and a group fed the PL with 10% of cellulose. All those groups were given 0.5% salt water for drinking during the experiment. Urine and feces were collected during 24 hours with a metabolic cage on the 22nd and 29th days of experiment, and sodium and potassium were determined. On the 30th day of the experiment, five rats in each group were killed and heart weight was measured. RESULTS: Salt-accelerated hypertension was significantly attenuated in the SHRSP fed with 3% and 10% psyllium diets compared to those fed the PL and 10% cellulose diets (15th, 22nd, 29th day; 10% psyllium versus PL or 10% cellulose, P < 0.05, 29th day; 3% psyllium versus PL or 10% cellulose, P < 0.05). Ventricular weight was decreased in rats fed 3% or 10% psyllium diets. The amount of sodium, the amount of sodium/the intake of sodium and the sodium/potassium ratio in the feces were significantly increased in the groups on 3% and 10% psyllium diets both on the 22nd and 29th days of experiment compared with those on PL and 10% cellulose diets. CONCLUSIONS: The psyllium diet attenuated the salt-accelerated hypertension in SHRSP by a possible mechanism of increased fecal excretion of sodium absorbed into the psyllium.

25314643|t|The role of sodium-dependent glucose transporter 1 and glucose transporter 2 in the absorption of cyanidin-3-o-β-glucoside in Caco-2 cells.
25314643|a|Anthocyanins have multiple biological activities of benefit to human health. While a few studies have been conducted to evaluate the bioavailability of anthocyanins, the mechanisms of their absorption mechanism remain ill-defined. In the present study, we investigated the absorption mechanism of cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside (Cy-3-G) in human intestinal epithelial (Caco-2) cells. Cy-3-G transport was assessed by measuring the absorptive and efflux direction. Inhibition studies were conducted using the pharmacological agents, phloridzin, an inhibitor of sodium-dependent glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1), or phloretin, an inhibitor of glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2). The results showed that phloridzin and phloretin significantly inhibited the absorption of Cy-3-G. In addition, Caco-2 cells transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific for SGLT1 or GLUT2 showed significantly decreased Cy-3-G absorption. These siRNA transfected cells also showed a significantly decreased rate of transport of Cy-3-G compared with the control group. These findings suggest that Cy-3-G absorption is dependent on the activities of SGLT1 and GLUT2 in the small intestine and that SGLT1 and GLUT2 could be a limiting step for the bioavailability of Cy-3-G.

12504270|t|L-arginine and L-lysine stimulation on cultured human osteoblasts.
12504270|a|Essential amino acids, such as L-Arginine (Arg) and L-Lysine (Lys), are involved in bone metabolism and growth. Our previous studies analyzed the effect of these amino acids on rat osteoblast cultures and in experimental animals. In this study, we evaluated the effect of L-Arg and L-Lys on cultured human osteoblasts. Primary human osteoblast cultures were divided into four groups: the Arg Group received 0.625 mg/ml per day of Arg, the Lys Group 0.587 mg/ml per day of Lys, the Arg-Lys Group received both amino acids, whereas the Control Group was sham-treated. After 7 days, the following parameters were tested in all groups: alkaline phosphatase (ALP), nitric oxide (NO), calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), osteocalcin (OC), type I collagen (PICP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) on culture supernatant, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), and MTT proliferation test on cells. Arg administration significantly increased ALP, NO, PICP and IGF-I production and reduced the level of IL-6. Lys administration over the same time interval mainly affected cell proliferation, as evidenced by the MTT test and immunostaining for PDGF. The same positive effects evidenced by the single administrations of the two amino acids resulted from their simultaneous administration. However, synergism could be demonstrated only for the decrease in the level of IL-6. Arg and Lys show a positive effect on human osteoblasts, which is related partly to the production of those factors required for matrix synthesis, and partly to the direct or mediated activation of cell proliferation.

10329661|t|Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator regulates luminal Cl-/HCO3- exchange in mouse submandibular and pancreatic ducts.
10329661|a|We have demonstrated previously the regulation of Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in model systems of cells stably or transiently transfected with CFTR (Lee, M. G., Wigley, W. C., Zeng, W., Noel, L. E., Marino, C. R., Thomas, P. J., and Muallem, S. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 3414-3421). In the present work we examine the significance of this regulation in cells naturally expressing CFTR. These include the human colonic T84 cell line and the mouse submandibular gland and pancreatic ducts, tissues that express high levels of CFTR in the luminal membrane. As in heterologous expression systems, stimulation of T84 cells with forskolin increased the Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity independently of CFTR Cl- channel activity. Freshly isolated submandibular gland ducts from wild type mice showed variable Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity. Measurement of [Cl-]i revealed that this was largely the result of variable steady-state [Cl-]i. Membrane depolarization with 5 mM Ba2+ or 100 mM K+ increased and stabilized [Cl-]i. Under depolarized conditions wild type and DeltaF/DeltaF mice had comparable basal Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity. Notably, stimulation with forskolin increased Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity in submandibular gland ducts from wild type but not DeltaF/DeltaF mice. Microperfusion of the main pancreatic duct showed Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity in both the basolateral and luminal membranes. Stimulation of ducts from wild type animals with forskolin had no effect on basolateral but markedly stimulated luminal Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity. By contrast, forskolin had no effect on either basolateral or luminal Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity of ducts from DeltaF/DeltaF animals. We conclude that CFTR regulates luminal Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity in CFTR-expressing cells, and we discuss the possible physiological significance of these findings regarding cystic fibrosis.

23523904|t|Effect of hypoxia/reoxygenation on the cytokine-induced production of nitric oxide and superoxide anion in cultured osteoarthritic synoviocytes.
23523904|a|OBJECTIVE: Hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) is an important feature in the osteoarthritis (OA) physiopathology. Nitric oxide (NO) is a significant proinflammatory mediator in the inflamed synovium. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of H/R on inducible NO synthase (iNOS) activity and expression in OA synoviocytes. In addition we studied the relationship between nitrosative stress and NADPH oxidase (NOX) in such conditions. METHODS: Human cultured synoviocytes from OA patients were treated for 24 h with interleukin 1-β (IL-1β), tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α) or neither; for the last 6 h, they were submitted to either normoxia or three periods of 1-h of hypoxia followed by 1-h of reoxygenation. ·NO metabolism (iNOS expression, nitrite and peroxynitrite measurements) was investigated. Furthermore, superoxide anion O2(·-) production, NOX subunit expression and nitrosylation were also assessed. RESULTS: iNOS expression and nitrite (but not peroxynitrite) production were ~0.20 to ~0.12 nmol min(-1) mg proteins(-1) (P < 0.05), while NOXs' subunit expression and p47-phox phosphorylation were increased. NOXs and p47-phox were dramatically nitrosylated under H/R conditions (P < 0.05 vs normoxia). Using NOS inhibitors under H/R conditions, p47-phox nitrosylation was prevented and O2(·-) production was restored at normoxic levels (0.21 nmol min(-1) mg of proteins(-1)). CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence for an up-regulation of iNOS activity in OA synoviocytes under H/R conditions, associated to a down-regulation of NOX activity through nitrosylation. These findings highlight the importance of radical production to OA pathogenesis, and appraise the metabolic modifications of synovial cells under hypoxia.

26251470|t|Acetaldehyde accelerates HCV-induced impairment of innate immunity by suppressing methylation reactions in liver cells.
26251470|a|Alcohol exposure worsens the course and outcomes of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Activation of protective antiviral genes is induced by IFN-α signaling, which is altered in liver cells by either HCV or ethanol exposure. However, the mechanisms of the combined effects of HCV and ethanol metabolism in IFN-α signaling modulation are not well elucidated. Here, we explored a possibility that ethanol metabolism potentiates HCV-mediated dysregulation of IFN-α signaling in liver cells via impairment of methylation reactions. HCV-infected Huh7.5 CYP2E1(+) cells and human hepatocytes were exposed to acetaldehyde (Ach)-generating system (AGS) and stimulated with IFN-α to activate IFN-sensitive genes (ISG) via the Jak-STAT-1 pathway. We observed significant suppression of signaling events by Ach. Ach exposure decreased STAT-1 methylation via activation of protein phosphatase 2A and increased the protein inhibitor of activated STAT-1 (PIAS-1)-STAT-1 complex formation in both HCV(+) and HCV(-) cells, preventing ISG activation. Treatment with a promethylating agent, betaine, attenuated all examined Ach-induced defects. Ethanol metabolism-induced changes in ISGs are methylation related and confirmed by in vivo studies on HCV(+) transgenic mice. HCV- and Ach-induced impairment of IFN signaling temporarily increased HCV RNA levels followed by apoptosis of heavily infected cells. We concluded that Ach potentiates the suppressive effects of HCV on activation of ISGs attributable to methylation-dependent dysregulation of IFN-α signaling. A temporary increase in HCV RNA sensitizes the liver cells to Ach-induced apoptosis. Betaine reverses the inhibitory effects of Ach on IFN signaling and thus can be used for treatment of HCV(+) alcohol-abusing patients.

28982074|t|Autophagy regulates DUOX1 localization and superoxide production in airway epithelial cells during chronic IL-13 stimulation.
28982074|a|The airway epithelium is a broad interface with the environment, mandating well-orchestrated responses to properly modulate inflammation. Classically, autophagy is a homeostatic pathway triggered in response to external cellular stresses, and is elevated in chronic airway diseases. Recent findings highlight the additional role of autophagy in vesicle trafficking and protein secretion, implicating autophagy pathways in complex cellular responses in disease. Th2 cytokines, IL-13 and IL-4, are increased in asthma and other airway diseases contributing to chronic inflammation. Previously, we observed that IL-13 increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) in airway epithelial cells in an autophagy-dependent fashion. Here, we tested our hypothesis that autophagy is required for IL-13-mediated superoxide production via the NADPH oxidase DUOX1. Using a mouse model of Th2-mediated inflammation induced by OVA-allergen, we observed elevated lung amounts of IL-13 and IL-4 accompanied by increased autophagosome levels, determined by LC3BII protein levels and immunostaining. ROS levels were elevated and DUOX1 expression was increased 70-fold in OVA-challenged lungs. To address the role of autophagy and ROS in the airway epithelium, we treated primary human tracheobronchial epithelial cells with IL-13 or IL-4. Prolonged, 7-day treatment increased autophagosome formation and degradation, while brief activation had no effect. Under parallel culture conditions, IL-13 and IL-4 increased intracellular superoxide levels as determined by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Prolonged IL-13 activation increased DUOX1, localized at the apical membrane. Silencing DUOX1 by siRNA attenuated IL-13-mediated increases in superoxide, but did not reduce autophagy activities. Notably, depletion of autophagy regulatory protein ATG5 significantly reduced superoxide without diminishing total DUOX1 levels. Depletion of ATG5, however, diminished DUOX1 localization at the apical membrane. The findings suggest non-canonical autophagy activity regulates DUOX1-dependent localization required for intracellular superoxide production during Th2 inflammation. Thus, in chronic Th2 inflammatory airway disease, autophagy proteins may be responsible for persistent intracellular superoxide production.

8229793|t|Thapsigargin-evoked changes in human platelet Ca2+, Na+, pH and membrane potential.
8229793|a|1. In this work we explored the effect of thapsigarin on the intracellular Ca2+, pH, Na+ and membrane potential in human platelets. These parameters were monitored using the fluorescent probes fura-2, 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein, sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate, and 3,3'-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide. 2. Thapsigargin caused an increase in the cytosolic Ca2+, coupled with cytosolic alkalinization. Thapsigargin-induced alkalinization was Na(+)-dependent, indicating that thapsigargin stimulated the Na(+)-H+ exchange. 3. Using Mn2+ as a Ca2+ surrogate, we showed that thapsigargin activated Ca2+ channels at relatively low levels of cytosolic Ca2+, suggesting that a rise in cytosolic free Ca2+ is not the signal for the activation of these channels. 4. Thapsigargin-induced increase in the cytosolic free Ca2+ was greater in Na(+)-containing medium than in Na(+)-free medium, suggesting that Na(+)-dependent mechanisms participate in the regulation of platelet cytosolic Ca2+. 5. Thapsigargin not only increased the cytosolic Ca2+, but also elevated the cytosolic free Na+. The latter effect was more pronounced in Ca(2+)-free medium, a finding that may indicate that some of the Na+ enters through Ca2+ entry pathways. 6. Finally, thapsigargin evoked sustained platelet hyperpolarization which was attenuated by charybdotoxin, indicating thapsigargin-induced stimulation of Ca(2+)-sensitive K+ channels. 7. Together these observations demonstrate a multifactorial effect of thapsigargin on platelets that can be utilized to further understand platelet ionic homeostasis.

1554353|t|Effect of polyamine depletion on chromatin structure in U-87 MG human brain tumour cells.
1554353|a|The chromatin structure of polyamine-depleted U-87 MG human brain tumour cells was studied by following the kinetics of digestion of cell nuclei by micrococcal nuclease and bovine pancreatic DNAase I. Cells growing in monolayers were treated with either alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), to deplete putrescine and spermidine, or N1,N14-bis(ethyl)homospermine (BE-4-4-4), to deplete putrescine, spermidine and spermine. BE-4-4-4 increased the initial rates of digestion and the magnitudes of limit digest by both enzymes; DFMO increased the limit digests without affecting initial digestion rates. Addition of 1 mM-putrescine 1 day after addition of DFMO reversed the effect of DFMO on limit digests. (Because polyamine uptake is low in cells treated with BE-4-4-4, and because putrescine does not reverse the growth-inhibitory effects of BE-4-4-4, reversal of the effects of BE-4-4-4 with putrescine was not attempted.) The increases in initial rates and limit digests did not result from changes in the lengths of nucleosomal or linker DNA, from blocks in cell-cycle progression, or from growth inhibition caused by DFMO or BE-4-4-4. Thus, because the limit digest is highest in cells with the lowest polyamine levels, it seems clear that the enhanced enzymic digestion of nuclei is caused by polyamine depletion and its possible effect on chromatin structure.

12147177|t|Antitubercular therapy decreases nitric oxide production in HIV/TB coinfected patients.
12147177|a|BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide (NO) production is increased among patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and also those with tuberculosis (TB). In this study we sought to determine if there was increased NO production among patients with HIV/TB coinfection and the effect of four weeks chemotherapy on this level. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 19 patients with HIV/TB coinfection were studied. They were treated with standard four drug antitubercular therapy and sampled at baseline and four weeks. 20 patients with HIV infection but no opportunistic infections were disease controls and 20 individuals as healthy controls. Nitrite and citrulline, surrogate markers for NO, were measured it spectrophotometrically. RESULTS: Mean age of HIV/TB patients was 28.4+6.8 years and CD4 count was 116+36.6/mm3. Mean nitrite level among HIV/TB coinfected was 207.6+48.8 nmol/ml. This was significantly higher than 99.7+26.5 nmol/ml, the value for HIV infected without opportunistic infections and 46.4+16.2 nmol/ml, the value for healthy controls (p value <0.01). Level of HIV/TB coinfected declined to 144.5+ 34.4 nmol/ml at four weeks of therapy (p value < 0.05). Mean citrulline among HIV/TB coinfected was 1446.8+468.8 nmol/ml. This was significantly higher than 880.8+ 434.8 nmol/ml, the value for HIV infected without opportunistic infections and 486.6+212.5 nmol/ml, the value for healthy controls (p value <0.01). Levels of HIV/TB infected declined to 1116.2+388.6 nmol/ml at four weeks of therapy (p value <0.05). CONCLUSION: NO production is elevated among patients with HIV infection, especially so among HIV/TB coinfected, but declines significantly following 4 weeks of antitubercular therapy.

9918826|t|Glutathione and catalase provide overlapping defenses for protection against hydrogen peroxide in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
9918826|a|Glutathione (GSH) is an abundant and ubiquitous low-molecular-weight thiol which has proposed roles in many cellular processes including protection against the deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species. Our experiments have addressed the role of GSH in protection against hydrogen peroxide in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and have shown that GSH and catalase provide overlapping defense systems. GSH appears to be the primary antioxidant for protection against hydrogen peroxide since mutants lacking GSH (gsh1) or glutathione reductase (glr1) are sensitive, whereas, strains lacking catalase A (cta1) or catalase T (ctt1) are unaffected in resistance to this oxidant. Furthermore, following treatment with hydrogen peroxide, the levels of oxidized, protein-bound and extracellular GSH were all increased at the expense of intracellular GSH. However, there are two lines of evidence that indicate catalases are required in the absence of GSH; firstly, strains that lack both catalase A and T accumulate increased levels of oxidized glutathione following treatment with hydrogen peroxide; and secondly, deletion of catalase genes exacerbates the hydrogen peroxide sensitivity of glr1 and gsh1 mutants.

6259362|t|Role of external potassium in the calcium-induced potassium efflux from human red blood cell ghosts.
6259362|a|The exposure of red cell ghosts to external Ca++ and K+ leads to a rapid net K+ efflux. Preincubation of the ghosts for various lengths of time in the absence of K+ in the external medium prior to a challenge with maximally effective concentrations of Ca++ and K+ renders the ghosts unresponsive to that challenge with a half-time of about 7-10 min. Preincubation at a range of K+ concentrations for a fixed length of time (60 min) prior to the challenge revealed that K+ concentrations of about 500 microM or more suffice to maintain the K+ channel in a maximally responsive state for at least 60 min. These K+ concentrations are considerably lower than the K+ concentrations required to make the responsive channel respond with a maximal rat of K+ efflux. Thus external K+ is not only necessary to induce the permeability change but also to maintain the transport system in a functional state. The presence of Mg++ or ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA) in the K+-free preincubation media preserves the responsiveness to a challenge with Ca++ plus K+. In contrast to external K+, the presence of external Ca++ does not reduce but rather enhances the loss of responsiveness. An excess of EDTA prevents the effects of Ca++ while washes with EDTA after exposure to Ca++ do not reverse them. In red cell ghosts that contain Ca++ buffers, the transition from a responsive to a nonresponsive state incubation in the absence of external K+ is enhanced. The effects of incubation in the presence of Ca++ in K+-free media are reversed; external Ca++ now reduces the rate at which the responsiveness is lost. The loss of responsiveness after incubation in K+-free media prior to a challenge with external K+ and internal Ca++ does also take place when K+-efflux from red cell ghosts is measured by means of 42K+ into media that have the same K+ concentrations as the ghost interior. This confirms that the effects of K+-free incubation are due to the modification of the K+-selective channel rather than to an inhibition of diffusive Cl--efflux.

1730594|t|Metabolism of 4'-azidothymidine. A compound with potent and selective activity against the human immunodeficiency virus.
1730594|a|4'-Azidothymidine (ADRT) is a novel nucleoside analog, that selectively inhibits human immunodeficiency virus replication in human lymphocytes. Unlike the dideoxyribonucleoside analogs and 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT), ADRT retains the 3'-hydroxy group. The pathways of ADRT metabolism were elucidated by determining: (i) the kinetics of the interactions of ADRT and its metabolites with enzymes of thymidine metabolic pathways, (ii) the pool sizes of phosphorylated metabolites, and (iii) the nature of ADRT incorporation into human DNA. ADRT is not a substrate for thymidine phosphorylase, but is metabolized by kinases. Thymidine kinase phosphorylates ADRT to ADRT monophosphate (ADRT-MP). For this enzyme, ADRT has a Ki value of 5.2 microM, in comparison to a Km value of 0.7 microM for thymidine. The Km value of ADRT toward thymidine kinase is 8.3 microM and the rate of ADRT phosphorylation is 1.4% that of thymidine phosphorylation. ADRT-MP has a low affinity toward thymidylate kinase (a Ki value of 28.9 microM versus a Km value of 0.56 microM for thymidylate), and toward thymidylate synthase (a Ki value of 180 microM versus a Km value of 8 microM for deoxyuridylate). The results suggest that ADRT can be activated effectively by cellular kinases without significant interference of normal thymidine metabolism. In cultured human lymphocytes (A3.01, H9, and U937 cells), ADRT was phosphorylated efficiently to ADRT 5'-triphosphate (ADRT-TP), which is the major metabolite of ADRT. The intracellular concentrations of ADRT-TP ranged from 1 to 3.3 microM after 24 h of incubation with 2 microM of ADRT and the half-life of ADRT-TP varied from 3 to 6 h. Although ADRT-TP is a poor competitive inhibitor against dTTP toward DNA polymerases alpha and beta with Ki values of 62.5 and 150 microM, respectively. ADRT-MP was found to be internally incorporated into cellular DNA. The extent of ADRT-MP substitution for dTMP in DNA was 1 in 6979 for A3.01 cells incubated with 2.9 microM ADRT for 24 h. Internal incorporation of ADRT-MP contrasts with the mechanism of other 2',3'-dideoxynucleoside analogs (i.e. AZT, ddC, ddI, d4T...), which are DNA chain terminators. This finding indicates that a 3'-deoxy structure in a nucleoside analog is not a prerequisite for anti-human immunodeficiency virus activity.

1333427|t|Sodium transport in human intestinal basolateral membrane vesicles.
1333427|a|The current investigation was aimed at characterizing transport pathways for Na+ in basolateral membrane vesicles (BLMV) isolated from organ donor jejunum and ileum. An outward proton gradient [pH inside, 5.5; pH outside, 7.5] led to a 4-5-fold stimulation of transport rates compared with the absence of proton-gradient conditions in both human jejunal and ileal BLMV. Voltage-clamping the vesicles (K+ inside = K+ outside + valinomycin) reduced the uptake of 22Na by 20%, indicating a minor conductive component of Na+ transport. Uptake of 22Na (1 mmol/L) in voltage-clamped BLMV was inhibited 70% by 2 mmol/L amiloride. Li+ and NH4+ inhibited transport of 22Na into voltage-clamped BLMV. Transport of Na+ exhibited saturation kinetics, and the Michaelis constant (Km) and Vmax values for jejunum and ileum were similar [Km, 27 +/- 3 mmol/L (jejunum) and 18 +/- 2 mmol/L (ileum); Vmax, 19 +/- 2 nmol.mg protein-1.min-1 (jejunum) and 16 +/- 1 nmol.mg protein-1.min-1 (ileum)]. Vmax values were < 15% of those reported for brush border membrane, whereas Km values were comparable. The results show that Na+ transport in human jejunal and ileal BLMV occurs via an Na+/H+ exchanger and a minor conductive pathway.

8976075|t|[Inhibitory effect of rat alveolar type II cells on production of superoxide by neutrophils].
8976075|a|Neutrophils induce lung injury by releasing superoxides (O2-) and elastases. Alveoli contain anti-neutrophil agents such as surfactant. We studied the effects of alveolar type II cells on neutrophil functions. Neutrophils were isolated from human venous blood and their O2- production was measured by the cytochrome C reduction method. Type II cells and fibroblasts were isolated from rat lungs. Neutrophil O2-production was inhibited in the presence of type II cells. This effect was specific to type II cells: fibroblasts caused no inhibition. The inhibition did not require cell-to-cell contact, and it was abolished by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME. These results show that type II cells can inhibit neutrophil O2-production, and suggest that anti-neutrophil activity in alveoli may involve both surfactant and type II cells.

26079827|t|Cell proliferation and drug sensitivity of human glioblastoma cells are altered by the stable modulation of cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II.
26079827|a|Cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II (cN-II) has been reported to be involved in cell survival, nucleotide metabolism and in the cellular response to anticancer drugs. With the aim to further evaluate the role of this enzyme in cell biology, we stably modulated its expression the human glioblastoma cell ADF in which the transient inhibition of cN-II has been shown to induce cell death. Stable cell lines were obtained both with inhibition, obtained with plasmids coding cN-II-targeting short hairpin RNA, and stimulation, obtained with plasmids coding Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP)-fused wild type cN-II or a GFP-fused hyperactive mutant (GFP-cN-II-R367Q), of cN-II expression. Silenced cells displayed a decreased proliferation rate while the over expressing cell lines displayed an increased proliferation rate as evidenced by impedance measurement using the xCELLigence device. The expression of nucleotide metabolism relevant genes was only slightly different between cell lines, suggesting a compensatory mechanism in transfected cells. Cells with decreased cN-II expression were resistant to the nucleoside analog fludarabine confirming the involvement of cN-II in the metabolism of this drug. Finally, we observed sensitivity to cisplatin in cN-II silenced cells and resistance to this same drug in cN-II over-expressing cells indicating an involvement of cN-II in the mechanism of action of platinum derivatives, and most probably in DNA repair. In summary, our findings confirm some previous data on the role of cN-II in the sensitivity of cancer cells to cancer drugs, and suggest its involvement in other cellular phenomenon such as cell proliferation.

15030613|t|Respiratory system simulations and modeling.
15030613|a|Simulators and models of the respiratory system range from simple mechanical devices to complex systems that include sophisticated computers. These systems have considerable utility in clinician education, guiding therapies, evaluating new devices and techniques, and in improving our understanding of the cardiorespiratory system. Simulators and models are of 3 types: signs-and-symptoms simulators, anatomic models, and physiologic models. Signs-and-symptoms simulators range from human actors to computer-controlled patient mannequins. Clinical scenarios, from minor abnormalities to catastrophic emergencies, can be simulated. As has been found with aircraft cockpit simulators, improved clinician performance in simulated emergencies should translate into improved performance in real patient-care situations. Anatomic modeling can simulate basic anatomy for training clinicians. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the airways, using real patient data, can help to plan therapy, understand the disease process, and warn of safety issues. Anatomic modeling with radiographs and magnetic resonance images, sometimes created using radiolabeled tracer gases, can create 3-dimensional images of regional lung anatomy and function. Physiologic signals such as carbon dioxide production, oxygen consumption, and washout/washin of various tracer gases can be used to model ventilation-perfusion and ventilation-volume relationships, and those models can improve understanding of disease processes and guide therapies.

3944256|t|Erythrocyte catalase. A somatic oxidant defense?
3944256|a|Mammalian erythrocytes have large amounts of catalase, an enzyme which catabolizes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Because catalase has a low affinity for H2O2, others have suggested that glutathione peroxidase clears most H2O2 within the erythrocyte and that catalase is of little import. We hypothesized that erythrocyte catalase might function to protect heterologous somatic cells against challenge by high levels of exogenous H2O2 (e.g., in areas of inflammation). We find that, whereas nucleated cells (L1210 murine leukemia) are readily killed by an enzymatically generated flux of superoxide (and, therefore, H2O2), the addition of human and murine erythrocytes blocks lethal damage to the target cells. Inhibition of erythrocyte superoxide dismutase, depletion of glutathione, and lysis of the erythrocytes do not diminish this protection. However, inhibition of erythrocyte catalase abrogates the protective effect and the addition of purified catalase (but not superoxide dismutase) restores it. Furthermore, erythrocytes derived from congenitally hypocatalasemic mice (in which other antioxidant systems are intact) do not protect L1210 cells. Our results raise the possibility that the erythrocyte may serve as protection against by-products of its own cargo, oxygen.

10403847|t|Reactive oxygen species as a risk factor in verotoxin-1-exposed rats.
10403847|a|It has been suggested the the interaction of Escherichia coli O157-derived verotoxins (VTs) with the vascular endothelium plays a central role in the pathogenesis of the thrombotic microangiopathy and ischemic lesions characteristic of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and E. coli O157-associated hemorrhagic colitis. Intravenous administration of both E. coli O157-derived VT1 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the rat induced a synergistic increase in thiobarbituric acid (TBA) values in those animal's plasma, as compared with that injected with VT1 or LPS alone. We then hypothesized that an increase in lipid peroxidation in the rat plasma was due to an enhanced production of endothelial cell-derived reactive oxidant. Based on determination of rat sera and cultured human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs), VT1 had little if any effect on LPS-stimulated increase of nitric oxide and the resultant peroxynitrite generations. Both RT-PCR and Western blot studies of reactive oxygen species-related enzymes showed that VT1 markedly decreased the expression of catalase mRNA and protein in HAECs, but caused less alteration in the levels of Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase, and NADPH oxidase mRNA. Further studies by spin trapping analysis using 5, 5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) revealed a time-dependent increase in hydroxyl radicals by VT1 in HAECs. The accumulated data thus suggest that bacterial VT1 reduces mainly catalase levels in endothelial cells, which is synergistically potentiated by LPS, and that the resulting hydroxyl radical participates in endothelium injury through a marked enhancement of lipid peroxidation, leading to HUS.

1702091|t|Growth performance and carcass composition of lambs infused for 28 days with a growth hormone-releasing factor analogue.
1702091|a|A human growth hormone-releasing factor analogue, [DesNH2Tyr1,D-Ala2,Ala15]hGRF(1-29)NH2 (GRF-A), was infused s.c. into lambs for 28 d to determine its effects on growth performance and carcass composition. Twenty crossbred wethers weighing 47.0 +/- .5 kg were implanted with 7-d osmotic minipumps at weekly intervals. Minipumps contained either vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide:H2O, 1:1) or GRF-A, released at a rate of 208 pmol (or .7 micrograms).h-1.kg-1. During the infusion period, plasma GH levels were increased (P less than .01) in GRF-A-treated wethers compared with control wethers (15.0 vs 9.3 ng/ml) and were higher on days that closely followed minipump implantation. Plasma IGF-I and hepatic IGF-I RNA concentrations were similar in lambs of both groups. Analogue treatment improved feed conversion (4.9 vs 5.8 kg dry matter/kg gain, P less than .05), increased average daily gain (.35 vs .30 kg, P = .05) and had no effect on feed intake, wool growth and body, carcass, selected organ and pituitary weights. Carcasses from GRF-A-infused lambs had less adjusted fat depth, a lower percentage of fat and a higher percentage of protein (P less than .05) than carcasses from control lambs. Magnitude of most effects of GRF-A on carcass measurements were correlated with the mean GH level that a lamb had during the infusion period. In conclusion, s.c. infusion of GRF-A improved feed utilization and altered carcass composition of feeder lambs in a relatively short period of time (28 d).

3666668|t|Functional defect of zinc transport in patients with Crohn's disease.
3666668|a|In the present study, we investigated the question whether the zinc deficiency in Crohn's disease is, at least partly, related to defective zinc entry at the jejunal brush border membrane. Brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) were prepared from surgically resected pieces of morphologically intact human jejunum by a Mg++ precipitation method. We studied zinc, D-glucose, sodium and D-mannitol uptake into BBMV in 27 patients: 1) 20 patients with Crohn's disease 2) 7 controls. In 8/20 patients with Crohn's disease we found a significant decrease in zinc uptake (-25% +/- 5%, p less than 0.05) into BBMV. This impairment of zinc uptake in 40% of our patients with Crohn's disease was not associated with changes in the transport rates for D-glucose, sodium or D-mannitol. In addition no differences in enzyme marker concentrations or electron microscopic appearance were found.

12709590|t|Heme oxygenase-1 gene expression attenuates angiotensin II-mediated DNA damage in endothelial cells.
12709590|a|Heme oxygenase (HO) catalyzes the conversion of heme to biliverdin with the release of iron and carbon monoxide. HO-1 is inducible by inflammatory conditions, which cause oxidative stress in endothelial cells. Overexpression of human HO-1 in endothelial cells may have the potential to provide protection against a variety of agents that cause oxidative stress. We investigated the physiological significance of human HO-1 overexpression using a retroviral vector on attenuation of angiotensin II (Ang II)-mediated oxidative stress. Comet and glutathione (GSH) levels were used as indicators of the levels of oxidative stress. Comet assay was performed to evaluate damage on DNA, whereas GSH levels were measured to determine the unbalance of redox potential. Pretreatments with inducers, such as heme 10 microM, SnCl(2) 10 microM, and inhibitors, such as tin-mesoporphyrin 10 microM was followed by treatment with Ang II 200 ng/ml. Pretreatment with heme or SnCl(2) provoked significant reductions (P < 0.01) of tail moment in the comet assay. Opposite effects were evident by pretreatment for 16 hr with tin-mesoporphyrin. A decrease in tail moment levels was found in human endothelial cells transduced with the human HO-1 gene. The addition of Ang II (200 ng/ml) to human dermal microvessel endothelial cell-1 for 16 hr resulted in a significant (P < 0.05) reduction of GSH contents control endothelial cells but not in endothelial cells transduced with HO-1 gene. The results presented indicated that stimulation or overexpression of HO-1 attenuated DNA damages caused by exposures of Ang II.

6115087|t|[Rational atmosphere in manned sealed cabins and the prospects of its use].
6115087|a|Physiological validation of an artificial atmosphere in manned cabins of flying vehicles remains to be one of the major biomedical problems. It has been experimentally demonstrated that oxygen and carbon dioxide are closely related in vital processes, acting as antagonists or synergists. Changing their content in an enclosure, it is possible to influence the function of the human body and to correct its deconditioning due to prolonged hypokinesia. Active mountain adaptation accompanied by a marked mobilization of physiological systems seems to train and activate functional reserves of the body, making them more adequate to tolerate extreme effects.

28380568|t|Stable Isotopes Reveal Rapid Cycling of Soil Nitrogen after Manure Application.
28380568|a|Understanding the fate of applied nitrogen (N) in agricultural soils is important for agronomic, environmental, and human health reasons, but it is methodologically difficult to study at the field scale. Natural abundance stable isotope measurements (δN) were used in this field study with micrometeorological measurements of nitrous oxide (NO) emissions to identify the biogeochemical processes responsible for rapid N transformations immediately after application of liquid dairy manure. Fifteen samplings occurred between 16 Mar. 2012 and 5 Apr. 2013, with a focus on spring manure application (before and after) and a winter snowmelt period. Concentrations and δN values of ammonium (NH), nitrate (NO), NO, and total N were measured throughout the year. Approximately 56 (±7)% of the NH-N applied in the spring could not be accounted for 3 d after manure application and was presumably lost by ammonia volatilization before it was tilled into the soil and/or removed from the inorganic N pool by microbial assimilation. Almost all of the remaining manure-NH (95 ± 1.1%) was converted within 3 wk to NO and NO by nitrification and nitrifier-denitrification, respectively. The in situ N isotope effect for nitrification (ε) was calculated to be -32.0 (±5.3)‰. Overall, field-scale measurements of δN at natural abundance provided valuable information that was used to distinguish sources of NH (manure vs. soil organic N) and to follow the production and consumption of NO and the pathways of NO production in soil.

24480247|t|Glutathione S-transferase Mu 2-transduced mesenchymal stem cells ameliorated anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody-induced glomerulonephritis by inhibiting oxidation and inflammation.
24480247|a|INTRODUCTION: Oxidative stress is implicated in tissue inflammation, and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated nephritis. Using the anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody-induced glomerulonephritis (anti-GBM-GN) mouse model, we found that increased expression of glutathione S-transferase Mu 2 (GSTM2) was related to reduced renal damage caused by anti-GBM antibodies. Furthermore, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapy has shed light on the treatment of immune-mediated kidney diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate if MSCs could be utilized as vehicles to deliver the GSTM2 gene product into the kidney and to evaluate its potential therapeutic effect on anti-GBM-GN. METHODS: The human GSTM2 gene (hGSTM2) was transduced into mouse bone marrow-derived MSCs via a lentivirus vector to create a stable cell line (hGSTM2-MSC). The cultured hGSTM2-MSCs were treated with 0.5 mM H2O2, and apoptotic cells were measured by terminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. The 129/svj mice, which were challenged with anti-GBM antibodies, were injected with 10⁶ hGSTM2-MSCs via the tail vein. Expression of hGSTM2 and inflammatory cytokines in the kidney was assayed by quantitative PCR and western blotting. Renal function of mice was evaluated by monitoring proteinuria and levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and renal pathological changes were analyzed by histochemistry. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to measure inflammatory cell infiltration and renal cell apoptosis. RESULTS: MSCs transduced with hGSTM2 exhibited similar growth and differentiation properties to MSCs. hGSTM2-MSCs persistently expressed hGSTM2 and resisted H2O2-induced apoptosis. Upon injection into 129/svj mice, hGSTM2-MSCs migrated to the kidney and expressed hGSTM2. The anti-GBM-GN mice treated with hGSTM2-MSCs exhibited reduced proteinuria and BUN (58% and 59% reduction, respectively) and ameliorated renal pathological damage, compared with control mice. Mice injected with hGSTM2-MSCs showed alleviated renal inflammatory cell infiltration and reduced expression of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 (53%, 46% and 52% reduction, respectively), compared with controls. Moreover, hGSTM2-MSCs increased expression of renal superoxide dismutase and catalase, which may associate with detoxifying reactive oxygen species to prevent oxidative renal damage. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the enhanced protective effect of GSTM2-transduced MSCs against anti-GBM-GN might be associated with inhibition of oxidative stress-induced renal cell apoptosis and inflammation, through over-expression of hGSTM2 in mouse kidneys.

15371544|t|Disruption of yeast forkhead-associated cell cycle transcription by oxidative stress.
15371544|a|The effects of oxidative stress on yeast cell cycle depend on the stress-exerting agent. We studied the effects of two oxidative stress agents, hydrogen peroxide (HP) and the superoxide-generating agent menadione (MD). We found that two small coexpressed groups of genes regulated by the Mcm1-Fkh2-Ndd1 transcription regulatory complex are sufficient to account for the difference in the effects of HP and MD on the progress of the cell cycle, namely, G1 arrest with MD and an S phase delay followed by a G2/M arrest with HP. Support for this hypothesis is provided by fkh1fkh2 double mutants, which are affected by MD as we find HP affects wild-type cells. The apparent involvement of a forkhead protein in HP-induced cell cycle arrest, similar to that reported for Caenorhabditis elegans and human, describes a potentially novel stress response pathway in yeast.

6721486|t|Heterotrophic nitrification among denitrifiers.
6721486|a|Twelve denitrifying bacteria representing six genera were tested for an ability to nitrify pyruvic oxime heterotrophically. Six of these bacteria exhibited appreciable nitrification activity, yielding as much as 5.8 mM nitrite and little or no nitrate when grown in a mineral salts medium containing 7 mM pyruvic oxime and 0.05% yeast extract. Of the six active bacteria, four (Pseudomonas denitrificans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and two strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens) could grow on yeast extract but not pyruvic oxime, one (Pseudomonas aureofaciens) could grow slowly on pyruvic oxime, and one (Alcaligenes faecalis) could apparently grow on pyruvic oxime in the presence of yeast extract but not in its absence. Eight of the twelve bacteria in the resting state could oxidize hydroxylamine to nitrite, and P. aureofaciens was remarkably active in this regard. In general, those denitrifiers active in the nitrification of pyruvic oxime or hydroxylamine or both are abundant in soils. A possible advantage of having nitrification and denitrification capabilities in the same organism is discussed.

10502206|t|Comparison of vessel dilator and long-acting natriuretic peptide in the treatment of congestive heart failure.
10502206|a|BACKGROUND: Long-acting natriuretic peptide (LANP; proANF 1-30) and vessel dilator (proANF 31-67) enhance sodium and water excretion in healthy human beings. The current investigation was designed to compare the beneficial effects of LANP and vessel dilator in persons with congestive heart failure (CHF). METHODS AND RESULTS: LANP and vessel dilator (100 ng/kg body weight/min, respectively) were given intravenously for 60 minutes to subjects with New York Heart Association class III CHF (n = 17) while their urine volume and sodium and potassium excretion were monitored. Vessel dilator increased urine flow more than 5-fold, which was still increased (P <.001) 3 hours after stopping its infusion. Vessel dilator enhanced sodium excretion 3-fold in subjects with CHF (P <.01), which was still significantly (P <.01) elevated 3 hours after infusion. The effects of LANP were diminished, with urine flow only increasing 2-fold (P <.05). The fractional excretion of sodium increased maximally 6-fold secondary to vessel dilator and 3-fold with LANP. The CHF control patients had no changes in the above parameters. Part of the diminished response to LANP was found to be caused by its rapid decrease in the circulation of individuals with CHF. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that vessel dilator has significant beneficial diuretic and natriuretic properties, which are not diminished, whereas the effects of LANP are diminished in human beings with CHF compared with healthy individuals.

26470683|t|Dual utilization of NADPH and NADH cofactors enhances xylitol production in engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
26470683|a|Xylitol, a natural sweetener, can be produced by hydrogenation of xylose in hemicelluloses. In microbial processes, utilization of only NADPH cofactor limited commercialization of xylitol biosynthesis. To overcome this drawback, Saccharomyces cerevisiae D452-2 was engineered to express two types of xylose reductase (XR) with either NADPH-dependence or NADH-preference. Engineered S. cerevisiae DWM expressing both the XRs exhibited higher xylitol productivity than the yeast strain expressing NADPH-dependent XR only (DWW) in both batch and glucose-limited fed-batch cultures. Furthermore, the coexpression of S. cerevisiae ZWF1 and ACS1 genes in the DWM strain increased intracellular concentrations of NADPH and NADH and improved maximum xylitol productivity by 17%, relative to that for the DWM strain. Finally, the optimized fed-batch fermentation of S. cerevisiae DWM-ZWF1-ACS1 resulted in 196.2 g/L xylitol concentration, 4.27 g/L h productivity and almost the theoretical yield. Expression of the two types of XR utilizing both NADPH and NADH is a promising strategy to meet the industrial demands for microbial xylitol production.

28293842|t|Analysis of Ethylene Receptors: Assay for Histidine Kinase Activity.
28293842|a|The ethylene receptors of plants exist in two subfamilies. Members of subfamily-1 have functional histidine kinase domains, whereas members of subfamily-2 have diverged histidine-kinase-like domains that in some cases have been shown to exhibit Ser/Thr kinase activity. Here, we describe a method to biochemically characterize the enzymatic activity of these kinase domains in vitro. For this purpose, the histidine kinase domain of the receptors is transgenically expressed in yeast as a fusion to glutathione-S-transferase (GST) for subsequent affinity purification. Autophosphorylation activity is assessed by the use of an in vitro kinase assay with the purified protein. Acid/base stability of the incorporated phosphate can then be used as a diagnostic for whether His, Asp, or Ser/Thr/Tyr is phosphorylated.

27009201|t|Reactive oxygen species stimulate mitochondrial allele segregation toward homoplasmy in human cells.
27009201|a|Mitochondria that contain a mixture of mutant and wild-type mitochondrial (mt) DNA copies are heteroplasmic. In humans, homoplasmy is restored during early oogenesis and reprogramming of somatic cells, but the mechanism of mt-allele segregation remains unknown. In budding yeast, homoplasmy is restored by head-to-tail concatemer formation in mother cells by reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced rolling-circle replication and selective transmission of concatemers to daughter cells, but this mechanism is not obvious in higher eukaryotes. Here, using heteroplasmic m.3243A > G primary fibroblast cells derived from MELAS patients treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), we show that an optimal ROS level promotes mt-allele segregation toward wild-type and mutant mtDNA homoplasmy. Enhanced ROS level reduced the amount of intact mtDNA replication templates but increased linear tandem multimers linked by head-to-tail unit-sized mtDNA (mtDNA concatemers). ROS-triggered mt-allele segregation correlated with mtDNA-concatemer production and enabled transmission of multiple identical mt-genome copies as a single unit. Our results support a mechanism by which mt-allele segregation toward mt-homoplasmy is mediated by concatemers.

9000256|t|In vitro effect of avarone and avarol, a quinone/hydroquinone couple of marine origin, on platelet aggregation.
9000256|a|We investigated the effect on human platelet aggregation of the naturally occurring quinone/hydroquinone couple, avarone and avarol. Avarone exerted antiplatelet activity both on platelet-rich plasma and, to a greater extent, on washed platelets. The quinone inhibited the platelet aggregatory process with all the agonists used. The highest inhibitory potency occurred with arachidonic acid or A23187 as stimulating agents. In the case of agonists such as adenosine 5' diphosphate, platelet-activating factor or U46619, the antiaggregatory effect was more pronounced on the second wave. Inhibition of the aggregatory process paralleled thromboxane B2 formation. Avarol also exerted antiplatelet activity, even though its inhibitory potency was much lower than that of avarone.

25056605|t|Stanniocalcin-1 promotes metastasis in a human breast cancer cell line through activation of PI3K.
25056605|a|Stanniocalcin-l (STC-1) is a secreted glycoprotein hormone that regulates calcium and phosphate homeostasis. STC-1 expression is upregulated in several cancers including breast cancer, and has been shown to be prognostic. Although these clinical observations implicate STC-1 as a potential tumor marker, it is still unclear whether STC-1 confers a malignant phenotype. In this study, this question was addressed by overexpressing STC-1 in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and examining the resultant phenotype in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of STC-1 enhanced invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro and promoted their lung metastasis in vivo, while having no effect on proliferation, adhesion, or proteinase activity. The addition of soluble STC-1 to MDA-MB-231 cultures resulted in the activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway, suggesting a mechanistic basis for the observed increases in cell motility and metastasis. Taken together, it was indicated that secreted STC-1 promotes metastatic potential of breast cancer cells via activation of PI3K/AKT.

24943082|t|[Normokalemic periodic paralysis lasting for two weeks: a severe form of sodium channelopathy with M1592V mutation].
24943082|a|A 73-year-old man with recurrent periodic paralytic episodes lasting for two weeks each admitted to our hospital because of the leg weakness and the elevated value of serum creatine kinase. On admission, weakness in the proximal legs and mild eye lid myotonia were noted. Needle electromyography revealed abundant myotonic discharges. The prolonged exercise test showed a continuous reduction of compound muscle action potentials in the abductor digiti minimi muscle. Direct sequencing of SCN4A in the proband showed a G-to-A alteration at position 4774 that results in a change of 1592(nd) methionine to valine (M1592V). Cosegregation regarding the M1592V mutation and paralytic phenotype in this family was confirmed. Two cardinal features in this family were longer paralytic episodes compared to classical hyperkalemic/normokalemic periodic paralysis and the normal potassium value during the paralytic episodes. This study together with antecedent reports indicates that M1592V mutation shares a much greater clinical diversity ranging from congenital paramyotonia to periodic paralysis with a longer duration.

10213485|t|Reactive nitrogen and oxygen radicals formed during hepatic ischemia-reperfusion kill weakly metastatic colorectal cancer cells.
10213485|a|Microscopic infarcts develop within the livers of athymic nude mice during the first 24 h after human colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cells arrest within hepatic sinusoids. Because these regions are reperfused, essentially all weakly metastatic clone A and MIP-101 CRC cells die, whereas many highly metastatic CX-1 CRC cells survive. Because hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells kill tumor cells in vitro by producing nitric oxide, superoxide anion, and other reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, our purpose was to determine whether reoxygenation of ischemic hepatic cultures in vitro forms toxic oxygen and nitrogen radicals that kill weakly but not highly metastatic CRC cells. CRC cells (10(7)) were labeled with rhodamine-dextran and calcein AM, cultured with cells from one mouse liver in a rotating suspension culture system for up to 24 h, and the metabolic activity of the CRC cells was determined. Liver fragments oxygenated normally before harvest were not toxic to either CRC cell line, but coculture with liver made ischemic by a 3-min ligation of the portal vein and hepatic artery in vivo before harvest and then cultured in oxygenated medium killed 50-70% of weakly metastatic clone A and MIP-101 cells at 24 h but <15% of highly metastatic CX-1 cells. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase, addition of exogenous superoxide dismutase, but not catalase or hypoxia, during coculture blocked the killing of weakly metastatic CRC cells. Thus, reoxygenation of hepatic parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells after ischemia may form toxic species that eliminate weakly metastatic CRCs within 24 h of their arrest in the liver.

25089715|t|Inhibition of IL-32 signaling by bamboo salt decreases pro-inflammatory responses in cellular models of allergic rhinitis.
25089715|a|Previously, we showed the antiallergic effect of bamboo salt (BS) in allergic rhinitis (AR). We also demonstrated that interleukin (IL)-32 is an important mediator of AR. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect and specific underlying mechanism of BS, NaCl, and the mineral mixture (components of BS other than NaCl, including zinc, magnesium, and potassium, Mix) on IL-32 signaling using the human monocyte cell line, THP-1. Here, we documented for the first time that BS significantly decreased IL-32-induced thymic stromal lymphopoietin protein and mRNA expression in THP-1 cells. BS treatment significantly inhibited IL-32-induced proinflammatory cytokine production including IL-1β, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α by suppressing nuclear factor-κB, p38 mitogen-activated kinase, and caspase-1 pathways. The presence of BS or Mix effectively suppressed IL-32-induced macrophage-like cell differentiation but NaCl exhibited no effect on monocyte-to-macrophage-like cell differentiation. In IL-32-induced macrophages, the production of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α, and expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2, induced by lipopolysaccharide was dramatically decreased in a dose-dependent manner after BS treatment. BS also significantly decreased IL-32-induced nitric oxide, IL-8, and TNF-α production. Furthermore, BS inhibited granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-induced IL-32 and IL-8 protein and mRNA expression in EOL-1 cells. Taken together, BS suppressed inflammatory activity by inhibiting the IL-32 signaling pathway in AR.

17561101|t|Cellular response to infrared radiation involves retrograde mitochondrial signaling.
17561101|a|Infrared A radiation (IRA) is a major component of sunlight. Similar to ultraviolet (UV) B and UVA, IRA induces gene transcription. In contrast to the UV response very little is known about the IRA response. In the present study, IRA-induced expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) was found to be mediated by the formation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Staining of IRA-irradiated cells with MitoSox revealed an increase in mitochondrial superoxide anion production and treatment of fibroblasts with the mitochondrial targeted antioxidant MitoQ completely abrogated the IRA, but not the UVB or UVA1, response. ROS relevant for IRA-induced signaling originated from the mt electron transport chain, because (i) chemical inhibition of the electron transport chain prevented IRA, but not UVB or UVA1, radiation-induced MMP-1 expression, (ii) rho0 fibroblasts specifically failed to increase MMP-1 expression in response to IRA, and (iii) peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 (PGC-1) overexpressing fibroblasts with increased electron transport chain content were hypersensitive to IRA radiation-induced gene expression. Thus, IRA, in contrast to UV, elicits a retrograde signaling response in human skin.

9172357|t|Silencing MIG1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: effects of antisense MIG1 expression and MIG1 gene disruption.
9172357|a|Silencing of MIG1, a transcription factor imposing carbon catabolite repression on invertase, was attempted, either by disrupting the gene or by expressing antisense copies of the gene. The performance of the recombinant strains in bioreactor batch cultivations on sucrose, in the presence of glucose, was compared with that of the wild-type strain under the same conditions. In the delta migI strain, the rate of sucrose utilization was independent (10 mmol/g/h) of the glucose concentration. During the cultivations with the wild-type strain and the antisense strains, two distinct phases were observed. The rates of sucrose hydrolysis were < 1 mmol/g/h and 9 to 10 mmol/g/h in the first and second phases, respectively. Entry into the second cultivation phase was characterized by a decline in glucose concentration below 12 mmol/liter. As expected, disruption of MIG1 resulted in a relief of glucose repression. However, silencing of MIG1 expression was not achieved by expressing antisense MIG1, even though antisense MIG1 RNA was sufficiently stable to be detected. In the wild-type and delta migI strains, the specific growth rate was 0.32 to 0.33 h-1, whereas it was lower in the antisense strains, 0.25 to 0.30 h-1.

8681964|a|In mammals, the final 11 beta-hydroxylation step of the hydrocortisone biosynthesis pathway is performed by a mitochondrial enzyme, namely cytochrome P-450(11 beta), together with the electron carriers adrenodoxin and NADPH adrenodoxin oxidoreductase. Successful production of a functional steroid 11 beta-hydroxylase activity was obtained in recombinant yeast in vivo. This conversion was achieved by coexpression of a mitochondrially targeted adrenodoxin and a modified bovine P-450(11 beta) whose natural presequence was replaced by a yeast presequence, together with an unexpected yeast endogenous NADPH-adrenodoxin-reductase-like activity. Adrenodoxin and P-450(11 beta) behave as a mitochondrial matrix and membrane protein, respectively. Saccharomyces cerevisiae apparently produces a mitochondrial protein which is capable of transferring electrons to bovine adrenodoxin, which in turn transfers the electrons to P-450(11 beta). The endogenous adrenodoxin oxidoreductase gains electrons specifically from NADPH. The notion that a yeast microsomal NADPH P-450 oxidoreductase can transfer electrons to mammalian microsomal P-450s can be extended to mitochondria, where an NADPH adrenodoxin oxidoreductase protein transfers electrons to adrenodoxin and renders a mitochondrial mammalian P-450 functional in vivo. The physiological function of this yeast NADPH adrenodoxin oxidoreductase activity is not known.

6402496|t|Metabolism of H2-CO2, methanol, and glucose by Butyribacterium methylotrophicum.
6402496|a|The fermentative metabolism of Butyribacterium methylotrophicum grown on either H2-CO2, methanol, glucose, or CO is described. The following reaction stoichiometries were obtained: 1.00 H2 + 0.52 CO2 leads to 0.22 acetate + 0.06 cell C; 1 methanol + 0.18 CO2 + 0.01 acetate leads to 0.24 butyrate + 0.29 cell C; and 1.00 glucose leads to 0.31 CO2 + 1.59 acetate + 0.21 butyrate + 0.13 H2 + 1.58 cell C. Cell yields of 1.7 g (dry weight) per mol of H2, 8.2 g (dry weight) per mol of methanol, 42.7 g (dry weight) per mol of glucose, and 3.0 g (dry weight) per mol of CO were obtained from linear plots of cell synthesis and substrate consumption. Doubling times of 9.0, 9.0, and 3 to 4 h were observed during batch growth on H2-CO2, methanol, and glucose, respectively. Indicative of a growth factor limitation, glucose fermentation in defined medium displayed a lower cell synthesis efficiency than when yeast extract (0.05%) was present. B. methylotrophicum fermentation displayed atypically high substrate/cell carbon synthesis conversion ratios for an anaerobe, as greater than 24% of the carbon was assimilated into cells during growth on methanol or glucose. The data indicate that B. methylotrophicum conserves carbon-bound electrons during growth on single-carbon or multicarbon substrates.

14732707|t|Similarity of binding sites of human matrix metalloproteinases.
14732707|a|Tissue components hydrolyzing matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) exhibit a high sequence similarity (56-64% in catalytic domains) and yet a significant degree of functional specificity. The hexapeptide-binding sites of 24 known human MMPs were compared in terms of their force field interaction energies with five probes that are most frequently encountered in substrates and inhibitors. The probes moved along a grid enclosing partially flexible binding sites in rigid catalytic domains that were represented by published experimental structures and comparative models and new comparative models for nine most recently characterized MMPs. For individual MMPs, representative interaction energies were obtained as averages for all suitable experimental structures. Correlations of the representative energies for all MMP pairs were succinctly catalogued for individual probes, subsites, and correlation levels. Among the probes (neutral sp(3) carbon and sp(3) oxygen, positive sp(3) nitrogen and hydrogen, and negative carbonyl oxygen), the last probe is least distinctive. Similarities of subsites are decreasing as S1 ' > S2 > S3 ' > S1 approximately S3 > S2 '. Most interesting, occupancies of subsites in published structures of MMP-inhibitor complexes follow an almost parallel trend, alluding to overall low selectivity of known MMP inhibitors. Flexible subsite S1 ' that appears as the specificity pocket in rigid x-ray structures is actually very similar among individual MMPs. Several correlations indicated that MMPs 3, 8, and 12 have similar binding sites. Modeling results are corroborated with published experimental data on MMP inhibition and substrate specificities. The results provide numerous clues for development of specific inhibitors and substrates, as well as for selection of MMPs for testing that provides maximum information without redundant experiments.

18604572|t|Behavioral effects of a deletion in Kcnn2, the gene encoding the SK2 subunit of small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels.
18604572|a|Small-conductance Ca(2+)-activated potassium (SK) channels are heteromeric complexes of SK alpha-subunits and calmodulin that modulate membrane excitability, are responsible for part of the after-hyperpolarization (AHP) following action potentials, and thus control the firing patterns and excitability of most central neurons. An engineered knockout allele for the SK2 subunit has previously been reported. The hippocampal neurons of these mice lacked the medium latency component of the AHP, but the animals were not described as presenting any overt behavioral phenotype. In this report, we describe a deletion in the 5' region of the Kcnn2 gene encoding the SK2 subunit in the mouse neurological frissonnant (fri) mutant. The frissonnant mutant phenotype is characterized by constant rapid tremor and locomotor instability. It has been suggested, based merely on its phenotype, as a potential model for human Parkinson disease. We used a positional cloning strategy to identify the mutation underlying the frissonnant phenotype. We narrowed the genetic disease interval and identified a 3,441-bp deletion in the Kcnn2 gene, one of the three candidate genes present in the interval. Expression studies showed complete absence of normal Kcnn2 transcripts while some tissue-specific abnormal truncated variants were detected. Intracellular electrophysiological recordings of central vestibular neurons revealed permanent alterations of the AHP and firing behavior that might cause the tremor and associated locomotor deficits. Thus, the fri mutation suggests a new, potentially important physiological role, which had not been described, for the SK2 subunit of small-conductance Ca(2+)-activated potassium channels.

14517341|t|Phospholipase D in cell proliferation and cancer.
14517341|a|Phospholipase D (PLD) has emerged as a regulator of several critical aspects of cell physiology. PLD, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) to phosphatidic acid (PA) and choline, is activated in response to stimulators of vesicle transport, endocytosis, exocytosis, cell migration, and mitosis. Dysregulation of these cell biological processes occurs in the development of a variety of human tumors. It has now been observed that there are abnormalities in PLD expression and activity in many human cancers. In this review, evidence is summarized implicating PLD as a critical regulator of cell proliferation, survival signaling, cell transformation, and tumor progression.

7736769|t|The acceleration of pH volume changes in human red cells by bicarbonate and the role of carbonic anhydrase.
7736769|a|The red cell shrinkage rate due to bicarbonate in media of high pH (ca 9.4) has been compared with the hydroxyl shrinkage rate on a per mM basis. The shrinkage rate due to bicarbonate was only half that due to OH-/Cl- exchanges. It was therefore deduced that the Jacobs-Stewart cycle was limited by the carbonic anhydrase step and not by the rate of transport on the anion exchanger protein. To explain this and other anomalies the hypothesis is made that carbonic anhydrase has evolved as a pH-dependent catalyst with specific physiological functions in pH regulation and in other cellular mechanisms. The kinetic theory and some physiological implications of the hypothesis are discussed.

26338708|t|Altered Lipid Synthesis by Lack of Yeast Pah1 Phosphatidate Phosphatase Reduces Chronological Life Span.
26338708|a|In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pah1 phosphatidate phosphatase, which catalyzes the dephosphorylation of phosphatidate to yield diacylglycerol, plays a crucial role in the synthesis of the storage lipid triacylglycerol. This evolutionarily conserved enzyme also plays a negative regulatory role in controlling de novo membrane phospholipid synthesis through its consumption of phosphatidate. We found that the pah1Δ mutant was defective in the utilization of non-fermentable carbon sources but not in oxidative phosphorylation; the mutant did not exhibit major changes in oxygen consumption rate, mitochondrial membrane potential, F1F0-ATP synthase activity, or gross mitochondrial morphology. The pah1Δ mutant contained an almost normal complement of major mitochondrial phospholipids with some alterations in molecular species. Although oxidative phosphorylation was not compromised in the pah1Δ mutant, the cellular levels of ATP in quiescent cells were reduced by 2-fold, inversely correlating with a 4-fold increase in membrane phospholipids. In addition, the quiescent pah1Δ mutant cells had 3-fold higher levels of mitochondrial superoxide and cellular lipid hydroperoxides, had reduced activities of superoxide dismutase 2 and catalase, and were hypersensitive to hydrogen peroxide. Consequently, the pah1Δ mutant had a shortened chronological life span. In addition, the loss of Tsa1 thioredoxin peroxidase caused a synthetic growth defect with the pah1Δ mutation. The shortened chronological life span of the pah1Δ mutant along with its growth defect on non-fermentable carbon sources and hypersensitivity to hydrogen peroxide was suppressed by the loss of Dgk1 diacylglycerol kinase, indicating that the underpinning of pah1Δ mutant defects was the excess synthesis of membrane phospholipids.

12139465|t|Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of indolequinone phosphoramidate prodrugs targeted to DT-diaphorase.
12139465|a|A series of 2- and 3-substituted indolequinone phosphoramidate prodrugs targeted to DT-diaphorase (DTD) have been synthesized and evaluated. These compounds are designed to undergo activation via quinone reduction by DTD followed by expulsion of the phosphoramide mustard substituent from the hydroquinone. Chemical reduction of the phosphoramidate prodrugs led to rapid expulsion of the corresponding phosphoramidate anions in both series of compounds. Compounds substituted at the 2-position are excellent substrates for human DTD (k(cat)/K(M) = (2-5) x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1)); however, compounds substituted at the 3-position are potent inhibitors of the target enzyme. Both series of compounds are toxic in HT-29 and BE human colon cancer cell lines in a clonogenic assay. There was a correlation found between cytotoxicity and DTD activity for the 2-series of phosphoramidates; however, there was no correlation between cytotoxicity and DTD activity in the 3-series of compounds. This finding suggests the presence of an alternative mechanism for the activation of these compounds.

27745956|t|Vitamin C modulates Microcystis aeruginosa death and toxin release by induced Fenton reaction.
27745956|a|Cyanobacterial blooms and their associated toxins pose a great threat to human beings. The situation is even worse for those whose drinking water source is a cyanotoxin-polluted water body. Therefore, efficient and safe treatments urgently need to be developed. The present study verified the application of vitamin C on the inhibition of toxic Microcystis aeruginosa. Our results showed that vitamin C drove the Fenton reaction and significantly sterilized cultures of M. aeruginosa. The algicidal activity of vitamin C was dependent on its involvement in iron (Fe) metabolism. Vitamin C enhanced iron absorption leading to high ferrous ion levels. The ferrous ion increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by Fenton reaction, which play a crucial role in the killing process. Interestingly, vitamin C also dramatically decreased the release of microcystins. This study highlights the possible benefits of using a vitamin C-induced Fenton reaction to remove M. aeruginosa and microcystins from drinking water sources.

19598250|t|Tissue kallikrein alleviates glutamate-induced neurotoxicity by activating ERK1.
19598250|a|Glutamate-induced neurotoxicity consequent to N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) and 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazol-4-yl) propionic acid (AMPA) receptor activation underlies the pathogenesis of a wide range of central nervous system disorders, including brain ischemia. Prevention of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced neuronal injury has long been regarded as an effective therapeutic strategy for ischemia. Human tissue kallikrein (TK) gene transfer has been shown to protect neurons against cerebral I/R-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress, via activation of the brandykinin B2 receptor (B2R). However, little is known about the role of TK on glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. Here we report that pretreatment of cultured cortical neurons with TK largely prevented glutamate-induced morphological changes and cell death. We found that TK pretreatment alleviated glutamate-induced oxidative stress by inhibiting neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activity, thereby reducing the generation of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Blockage of NMDA and AMPA receptors by their specific antagonists MK801 and CNQX had effects similar to those of TK administration. Furthermore, we found that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 cascade (ERK1/2), particularly ERK1, and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) were involved in TK neuroprotection against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. TK pretreatment activated ERK1 and NF-kappaB, leading to enhanced expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA and antiapoptotic gene Bcl-2 protein. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that TK attenuates glutamate-induced apoptosis through an intracellular signaling pathway including activation of B2R, ERK1/2, and NF-kappaB and up-regulation of BDNF and Bcl-2 expression. Thus, TK represents a promising therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke.

22824861|t|Radiosensitization by 2-deoxy-D-glucose and 6-aminonicotinamide involves activation of redox sensitive ASK1-JNK/p38MAPK signaling in head and neck cancer cells.
22824861|a|Our previous studies on simultaneous inhibition of glycolysis by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) and pentose phosphate activity by 6-aminonicotinamide (6-AN) have been shown to induce oxidative stress mediated selective radiosensitization in wide range of human malignant cells. However, the mechanism of radiosensitization induced by this combination (2-DG+6-AN) is not completely understood. Since activation of apoptotic signal regulating kinase (ASK1) and subsequent apoptosis are implicated in oxidative stress response, the role of ASK1 activation in radiosensitization by this combination was investigated in the present study. Our results demonstrated that redox alterations induced by this combination activated ASK1 and subsequent apoptosis during radiosensitization of head and neck carcinoma cells (KB). In addition, mRNA and protein expression of thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase decreased significantly under similar treatment conditions. Further, the downstream targets such as JNK and p38MAPK were also activated by this combination, and their pharmacological inhibition by SP600125 and SB201291 respectively resulted in suppression of 2-DG+6-AN mediated apoptosis in irradiated KB cells. Interestingly, the activation of ASK1 was mediated by hydrogen peroxide rather than superoxide anions as PEG-catalase but not PEG-SOD suppressed its activation. Our observations clearly suggest that redox alterations by inhibition of glucose metabolism serves as a molecular switch that activate ASK1-JNK/p38MAPK signaling in malignant cells during radiosensitization by 2-DG+6-AN. The present study emphasizes the importance of redox alterations in determining radiosensitivity of tumor cells that may greatly influence the outcome of radiation therapy.

8829814|t|Characterization of oviductal aromatase in the northern leopard frog, Rana pipiens.
8829814|a|Previous work has shown that the oviduct of the northern leopard frog, Rana pipiens, can convert testosterone to estradiol. The present paper examines the characteristics of the aromatase responsible for this reaction and compares it with human placental aromatase. Microsomes were isolated from the oviducts, and aromatase activity was assayed by a tritiated water release method. The Km and the Vmax for androstenedione were 188.1 +/- 30.2 nM and 1.42 +/- 0.11 fmol of estrogen produced/min/mg protein, respectively. Using the same method, human placental aromatase had a Km of 123.0 nM and a Vmax of 113.57 fmol of estrogen produced/min/mg protein. When tested at four temperatures between 15 and 45 degrees C, the frog enzyme showed maximum activity at 37 degrees C. The enzyme had a broad pH optimum between 7.4 and 10.4. The aromatase inhibitor 4-hydroxyandrostenedione inhibited activity by 20% at 0.3 microM and 40% at 0.5 microM. The present study provides additional evidence that an aromatase is present in the frog oviduct. Characterization of this enzyme revealed similarities to human placental aromatase, but the specific activity was much lower in the frog oviduct.

15561195|t|Analysis of clinical variables of donors and recipients with respect to short-term graft outcome in human liver transplantation.
15561195|a|UNLABELLED: Donor and recipient factors are closely associated with graft survival after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). This study was performed to analyze clinical characteristics of recipients and donors, which affect 30-day graft loss after OLT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred eighty-six livers from heart-beating donors were accepted between May 1997 and June 1998 at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Donor variables that were analyzed included age, sex, cold ischemia time (CIT), warm ischemia time (WIT), imported versus local procurement, cardiopulmonary arrest, serum sodium level, and dopamine dose. The recipient characteristics included native liver disease and UNOS status. Two-sided Fisher exact test and stepwise logistic regression were used for univariate and multivariate analyses. P-values < .05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Twenty-eight grafts (15.1%) were lost within 30 days of OLT. The following factors were found to adversely affect graft survival: donor sodium > 155 mEq/L (P = .002); CIT > 12 hours (P = .002); WIT > 45 minutes (P = .002); and imported liver graft (P = .048). Logistic regression revealed that donor sodium (odds ratio, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.05 to 8.74), CIT (OR 1.20; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.38), WIT (OR 1.06; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.09) were independent predictors of early graft loss. CONCLUSION: Donor hypernatremia as well as warm and cold ischemia times independently affect graft outcomes in the early postoperative period after OLT. Avoidance of long preservation and correction of donor sodium level are recommended to optimize results and survival in OLT.

23733596|t|L-cysteine and hydrogen sulfide increase PIP3 and AMPK/PPARγ expression and decrease ROS and vascular inflammation markers in high glucose treated human U937 monocytes.
23733596|a|Diabetic patients have lower blood levels of L-cysteine (LC) and hydrogen sulfide (H2 S) and a higher incidence of vascular inflammation. This study examined whether impaired LC or H2S levels affect vascular inflammation markers in diabetes. Human U937 monocytic cells were treated with high-glucose (HG, 25 mM, 20 h) in the presence or absence of LC (100, 500, or 1,000 µM, an endogenous precursor of H2 S) or Na2S (5 or 25 µM, an exogenous source of H2S). Both LC and Na2 S supplementation decreased intracellular ROS production and increased cellular PIP3 (phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate) in HG-exposed cells. The effect of LC on PIP3 was prevented by propargylglycine, an inhibitor of cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE) that catalyzes H2S formation from LC. Signal silencing studies with CSE siRNA also showed the inhibition of H2S formation and PIP3 upregulation in LC-supplemented CSE knockdown cells exposed to HG. This demonstrates that H2S plays a role in mediating the effect of LC on increased PIP3. Using the PI3K specific inhibitor LY294002, this study demonstrated that PI3K activation mediates the effect of LC and Na2S on PIP3 upregulation. Results showed that supplementation with LC and Na2S reduced NF-κB phosphorylation and the secretion of TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-8, IL-1β, and IP-10. Treatment with LC (500 µM), Na2S (25 µM), and PIP3 (5 nM) increased the AMPK phosphorylation and PPARγ expression in cells exposed to HG. This study reports for the first time a novel molecular mechanism by which Na2S or LC supplementation can lower oxidative stress and various markers of vascular inflammation in diabetes.

26942461|t|The antihypertensive drug hydralazine activates the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis and causes DNA damage in leukemic T cells.
26942461|a|Epigenetic therapies have emerged as promising anticancer approaches, since epigenetic modifications play a major role in tumor initiation and progression. Hydralazine, an approved vasodilator and antihypertensive drug, has been recently shown to act as a DNA methylation inhibitor. Even though hydralazine is already tested in clinical cancer trials, its mechanism of antitumor action remains undefined. Here, we show that hydralazine induced caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death in human p53-mutant leukemic T cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that hydralazine triggered the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis by inducing Bak activation and loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Hydralazine treatment further resulted in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, whereas a superoxide dismutase mimetic inhibited hydralazine-induced cell death. Interestingly, caspase-9-deficient Jurkat cells or Bcl-2- and Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells were strongly resistant to hydralazine treatment, thereby demonstrating the dependence of hydralazine-induced apoptosis on the mitochondrial death pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrate that hydralazine treatment triggered DNA damage which might contribute to its antitumor effect.

11479842|t|Attenuated expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase in lung microvascular endothelial cells is associated with an increase in ICAM-1 expression.
11479842|a|BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The molecular and cellular events that regulate inflammatory lung injury, a major cause of morbidity in surgical patients, remain unclear. The authors hypothesize that nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in regulating polymorphonuclear cell (PMN)-induced acute lung injury, and further, that attenuated expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and therefore decreased production of NO by lung microvascular endothelial cells (LMVEC), accelerates inflammation and injury. METHODS: LMVEC and aortic EC (AEC) from rat and human were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cytokines; changes in iNOS mRNA expression and iNOS activity were determined. The role of NO in mediating inflammatory responses was evaluated by determining PMN adherence to LMVEC and lung tissue slices in the presence and absence of NOS inhibitors and NO donors. Human LMVEC and AEC were assessed by FACS analysis for ICAM-1 expression, because this is thought to be a critical determinant of PMN adherence. RESULTS: When stimulated with endotoxin and cytokines, rat AEC monolayers express nearly 3-fold more iNOS mRNA than rat LMVEC. The low levels of LMVEC iNOS expression are associated with a 4-fold lower nitrite and nitrate production. Similar trends are seen in human endothelial cells. When iNOS activity was blocked, PMN adherence to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha)/LPS-stimulated LMVEC was markedly increased. In contrast, adding a nitric oxide donor to endotoxin/cytokine-stimulated LMVEC monolayers reduced PMN adherence to near background levels. Similar responses were observed in vivo. Human lung microvascular endothelial cells show a substantially increased level of ICAM-1 upregulation when compared with similarly stimulated human aortic macrovascular endothelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that LMVEC express less iNOS and produce less NO than AEC. This lower expression and activity of iNOS in LMVEC may be linked to increased expression of ICAM-1. Because ICAM-1 has been shown to be essential for tight PMN adherence, these data suggest that relatively low iNOS expression in LMVEC may contribute to a propensity for the lung to be injured by activated PMNs.

1646760|t|Regulation of fatty-acid metabolism by pancreatic hormones in cultured human hepatocytes.
1646760|a|The effects of pancreatic hormones and cyclic AMP on long-chain fatty-acid metabolism were investigated in human hepatocytes isolated from 12 liver biopsy specimens and cultured for 4 days in an insulin-free medium. Glucagon (10(-6) mol/L) increased endogenous ketone body production by 150%. This resulted from alterations in the partition of long-chain fatty acids from esterification toward oxidation. Glucagon or cyclic AMP enhanced (14C) oleate oxidation (basal = 45.8% +/- 5.0%; glucagon = 66.8% +/- 5.3%; cyclic AMP = 67.6% +/- 5.0% of metabolized oleate) at the expense of oleate esterification. Insulin (10(-7) mol/L) antagonized the glucagon-induced oleate oxidation. After 24 hr in basal culture conditions, the rate of lipogenesis decreased to the same low rate as in glucagon-treated cells. The presence of insulin did not restore a high rate of lipogenesis. These results are the first direct evidence of a control of ketone body production by glucagon in the human liver.

16236600|t|Functional interaction of carbonic anhydrase and chloride/bicarbonate exchange in human platelets.
16236600|a|Recently, our laboratory has reported the presence of one acidifying Cl-/HC exchange mechanism in human platelets. This paper demonstrates that this exchanger decreases its activity after inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. BCECF-loaded platelets, previously equilibrated in a bicarbonate/CO2 buffered solution, were resuspended in a Hepes-buffered, chloride-free (glucuronate) medium to produce a pHi increase. After addition of 50 mM NaCl, pHi fell rapidly reaching steady state in the succeeding 400 s. The recovery in chloride-containing solution was in contrast to the effect of a similar change in osmolarity by addition of 50 mM sodium glucuronate that produced a significantly slower variation of pHi. Alkali loads produced by 25 mM TMA were also counteracted by HC equivalent efflux via Cl-/HC exchange. The present study shows that the efflux of HC was slower when the platelets were previously incubated in 100 microM methazolamide. As a conclusion, the recovery of pHi from alkalosis by Na-independent Cl-/HC exchange is facilitated in platelets by the enzymatic activity of the carbonic anhydrase.

437792|t|Purine base transport in normal and mutant erythrocytes.
437792|a|The uptake of adenine and hypoxanthine in HGPRT-deficient and normal human erythrocytes was measured using a rapid filtering centrifugation technique. The transport of hypoxanthine as well as of adenine is impaired in the mutant cells. The transport of hypoxanthine into HGPRT-deficient erythrocytes differs from that into normal cells with respect to a higher accumulation capacity, to lower initial velocities and to the kinetic properties of the translocator. In addition, a higher accumulation capacity and lower initial velocities of adenine uptake could be demonstrated in  mutant cells. A linkage of the purine translocator with purine phosphoribosyltransferases associated with the erythrocyte membrane is discussed.

19713212|t|Extracellular chloride regulates the epithelial sodium channel.
19713212|a|The extracellular domain of the epithelial sodium channel ENaC is exposed to a wide range of Cl(-) concentrations in the kidney and in other epithelia. We tested whether Cl(-) alters ENaC activity. In Xenopus oocytes expressing human ENaC, replacement of Cl(-) with SO4(2-), H2PO4(-), or SCN(-) produced a large increase in ENaC current, indicating that extracellular Cl(-) inhibits ENaC. Extracellular Cl(-) also inhibited ENaC in Na+-transporting epithelia. The anion selectivity sequence was SCN(-) < SO4(2-) < H2PO4(-) < F(-) < I(-) < Cl(-) < Br(-). Crystallization of ASIC1a revealed a Cl(-) binding site in the extracellular domain. We found that mutation of corresponding residues in ENaC (alpha(H418A) and beta(R388A)) disrupted the response to Cl(-), suggesting that Cl(-) might regulate ENaC through an analogous binding site. Maneuvers that lock ENaC in an open state (a DEG mutation and trypsin) abolished ENaC regulation by Cl(-). The response to Cl(-) was also modulated by changes in extracellular pH; acidic pH increased and alkaline pH reduced ENaC inhibition by Cl(-). Cl(-) regulated ENaC activity in part through enhanced Na+ self-inhibition, a process by which extracellular Na+ inhibits ENaC. Together, the data indicate that extracellular Cl(-) regulates ENaC activity, providing a potential mechanism by which changes in extracellular Cl(-) might modulate epithelial Na+ absorption.

26123215|t|Enhanced neutrophil phagocytic capacity in rheumatoid arthritis related to the autoantibodies rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides.
26123215|a|BACKGROUND: There is no consensus on the mechanisms by which anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP) and rheumatoid factor (RF) influence the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The current study verified if the presence of RF or anti-CCP is associated with phagocytic capacity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by phagocytes in RA patients to better clarify the role played by these antibodies in pathogenesis of the disease. METHODS: A cohort of 30 RA patients followed from early stages of the disease were characterized by positivity for RF or anti-CCP, disease activity score (DAS-28), health assessment questionnaire (HAQ), use of synthetic or biologic therapy, lifestyle, comorbidities and radiographic erosions. Phagocytic capacity against Saccharomyces cerevisiae and superoxide anion production were assessed in RA patients and compared with 20 healthy controls. Phagocytic capacity and superoxide anion production were also compared between RF- and anti-CCP-positive and -negative RA patients. RESULTS: Anti-CCP- and RF-positive RA patients had higher neutrophil phagocytic capacity than anti-CCP- (p = 0.005) and RF (p = 0.005)-negative individuals through pattern-recognition receptors. As assessed via pattern recognition or opsonin receptors, neutrophils and monocytes from RA patients presented overall higher phagocytic capacity than neutrophils and monocytes from healthy controls (p < 0.05). Furthermore, RA patients also showed a higher capacity for producing cytotoxic oxygen radicals (p = 0.0026). Phagocytosis and superoxide anion production did not correlate with any of the clinical variables analyzed in this study. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed increased phagocytosis by neutrophils in RA patients who were positive for anti-CCP and RF autoantibodies. Furthermore, there was an overall hyperactivation of the phagocytes in RA patients. Our data suggest that anti-CCP and RF may indirectly enhance the inflammation cascade involving neutrophils and may indirectly sustain tissue damage in RA. Targeting the production of these autoantibodies may be a promising strategy in the management of RA.

22151908|t|The impact of phosphate scarcity on pharmaceutical protein production in S. cerevisiae: linking transcriptomic insights to phenotypic responses.
22151908|a|BACKGROUND: The adaptation of unicellular organisms like Saccharomyces cerevisiae to alternating nutrient availability is of great fundamental and applied interest, as understanding how eukaryotic cells respond to variations in their nutrient supply has implications spanning from physiological insights to biotechnological applications. RESULTS: The impact of a step-wise restricted supply of phosphate on the physiological state of S. cerevisiae cells producing human Insulin was studied. The focus was to determine the changes within the global gene expression of cells being cultured to an industrially relevant high cell density of 33 g/l cell dry weight and under six distinct phosphate concentrations, ranging from 33 mM (unlimited) to 2.6 mM (limited). An increased flux through the secretory pathway, being induced by the PHO circuit during low P(i) supplementation, proved to enhance the secretory production of the heterologous protein. The re-distribution of the carbon flux from biomass formation towards increased glycerol production under low phosphate led to increased transcript levels of the insulin gene, which was under the regulation of the TPI1 promoter. CONCLUSIONS: Our study underlines the dynamic character of adaptive responses of cells towards a change in their nutrient access. The gradual decrease of the phosphate supply resulted in a step-wise modulated phenotypic response, thereby alternating the specific productivity and the secretory flux. Our work emphasizes the importance of reduced phosphate supply for improved secretory production of heterologous proteins.

19014531|t|Safety evaluation of topical applications of ethanol on the skin and inside the oral cavity.
19014531|a| Ethanol is widely used in all kinds of products with direct exposure to the human skin (e.g. medicinal products like hand disinfectants in occupational settings, cosmetics like hairsprays or mouthwashes, pharmaceutical preparations, and many household products). Contradictory evidence about the safety of such topical applications of the alcohol can be found in the scientific literature, yet an up-to-date risk assessment of ethanol application on the skin and inside the oral cavity is currently lacking.The first and foremost concerns of topical ethanol applications for public health are its carcinogenic effects, as there is unambiguous evidence for the carcinogenicity of ethanol orally consumed in the form of alcoholic beverages. So far there is a lack of evidence to associate topical ethanol use with an increased risk of skin cancer. Limited and conflicting epidemiological evidence is available on the link between the use of ethanol in the oral cavity in the form of mouthwashes or mouthrinses and oral cancer. Some studies pointed to an increased risk of oral cancer due to locally produced acetaldehyde, operating via a similar mechanism to that found after alcoholic beverage ingestion.In addition, topically applied ethanol acts as a skin penetration enhancer and may facilitate the transdermal absorption of xenobiotics (e.g. carcinogenic contaminants in cosmetic formulations). Ethanol use is associated with skin irritation or contact dermatitis, especially in humans with an aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) deficiency.After regular application of ethanol on the skin (e.g. in the form of hand disinfectants) relatively low but measurable blood concentrations of ethanol and its metabolite acetaldehyde may occur, which are, however, below acute toxic levels. Only in children, especially through lacerated skin, can percutaneous toxicity occur.As there might be industry bias in many studies about the safety of topical ethanol applications, as well as a general lack of scientific research on the long-term effects, there is a requirement for independent studies on this topic. The research focus should be set on the chronic toxic effects of ethanol and acetaldehyde at the point of impact, with special regard to children and individuals with genetic deficiencies in ethanol metabolism.

8845429|t|Evaluation of a radioimmunoassay for determination of calcitriol in human sera employing a 125I-labelled tracer.
8845429|a|The performance characteristics of a radioimmunoassay employing a 125I-labelled tracer for determination of calcitriol in human sera are reported. The assay is based on an immunoextraction step employing a monoclonal antibody against calcitriol followed by a radioimmunoassay (using 125I-labelled calcitriol and sheep antiserum against calcitriol). Bound/free separation is performed with an anti-sheep IgG antibody bound to cellulose. Within-run imprecision (n = 20) was 12.8% (mean = 9.4 ng/l) and 11.1% (mean = 48.8 ng/l), between-day imprecision (n = 11) was 27.1% (mean = 9.6 ng/l) and 17.2% (mean = 47.2 ng/l). Linearity of dilution as investigated by mixing pooled sera containing 62.0 ng/l and 4.7 ng/l calcitriol, respectively. The relationship between measured and expected concentrations was characterized by a linear correlation coefficient of r = +0.990. The values obtained with the 125I-based radioimmunoassay were compared with those obtained with a radioreceptor-assay using a 3H-labelled tracer; the regression line was y = 1.091 x -4.545 (n = 84; r = +0.935), where y = calcitriol [125I] [ng/l] and x = calcitriol [3H] [ng/l]. Mixing 9 volumes of sera from patients with renal insufficiency (n = 7) with 1 volume of 'calibrator F' (assigned value: 227 ng/l) yielded recovery rates of 90 +/- 8% (mean +/- SD). The detection limit was 3.0 ng/l. The cross-reactivity of cholecalciferol metabolites was found to be < 0.00003 for 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, 24R,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol and 25S,26-dihydroxycholecalciferol. A preliminary reference interval (5th to 95th percentile) was established in 40 apparently healthy persons (17 males and 23 females; age range: 20-61 [mean: 32] years) (19-74 ng/l). The method presented shows high practicability and may therefore be considered as a useful alternative to cumbersome assays using 3H-labelled tracers.

1883351|a|A major novel coumarin metabolite was isolated from rat hepatic microsomal incubations by high-performance liquid chromatography. In the presence of a rat liver cytosolic fraction and NADH it was rapidly metabolized to O-hydroxyphenylethanol. The metabolite co-chromatographed with an authentic sample of O-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde and its identity was confirmed by mass spectral analysis. The formation of O-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde from coumarin was NADPH-dependent. It was the major metabolite formed by rat, gerbil and human liver microsomes at a coumarin concentration of 1mM.

21190290|t|A role for human neuroglobin in apoptosis.
21190290|a|Over the past decade, following the discovery of the human heme protein neuroglobin, many studies have searched for evidence for this protein's mechanism of action. Much data has accrued showing that high levels of neuroglobin will protect cells from apoptotic cell death, following a wide range of challenges. Various explanations of its actions, based on measured reactivity with oxygen, nitric oxide, or free radicals, have been proposed, but none have, as yet, been substantiated in vivo. Following preliminary experiments, it was previously hypothesised that "the central role of neuroglobin in highly metabolically active cells and retinal and brain neurons is to reset the trigger level of mitochondrial cytochrome c release necessary to commit the cells to apoptosis" (I.U.M.B.M. Life (2008) 60, 398). In this article, we review the evidence, which has accumulated to support this hypothesised mechanism of action of neuroglobin and integrate this data, with other reported intracellular functions of neuroglobin, to suggest a plausible central role for neuroglobin in the control of apoptosis.

9830501|t|Crucial suppressive role of renal kallikrein-kinin system in development of salt-sensitive hypertension.
9830501|a|Tissue kallikrein and low molecular weight kininogen are localized in the particular cells of the connecting tubules, indicating that kinin is immediately generated in the lumina of the lower nephrons. The role of the renal kallikreinkinin system was studied using mutant kininogen-deficient Brown NorwayKatholiek (BN-Ka) rats, and compared with that in normal BN-Kitasato rats of the same strain. Mutant BN-Ka rats showed no visible changes, but they were very sensitive to excess sodium ingestion and to the tendency of sodium to accumulate in the body by aldosterone released by angiotensin II, so that sodium was accumulated in erythrocytes and cerebrospinal fluid in BN-Ka rats and hypertension was induced. After four days infusion of 0.3 M NaCl solution to conscious and unrestrained mutant BN-Ka rats, the sensitivity of the vascular smooth muscle to norepinephrine and angiotensin II increased 30-fold and 10-fold, respectively. Bradykinin was degraded by neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and carboxypeptidase Y-like exopeptidase (CPY) in rat and human urine. Daily oral administration of a selective inhibitor of CPY, ebelactone B, or that of NEP, BP1O2, prevented development of deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertension in Sprague-Dawley rats. These results indicate that: 1) the renal kallikrein-kinin system allows excretion of excess sodium in the body, 2) decreased sodium excretion due to reduced excretion of urinary kallikrein in patients with essential hypertension or in genetically hypertensive rats may cause hypertension, and 3) urine kininase inhibitors such as ebelactone B may emerge as a new antihypertensive drug.

7518434|t|Potentiation of the oxidative burst of human neutrophils. A signaling role for L-selectin.
7518434|a|Production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) by the NADPH oxidase of neutrophils is a major mechanism of bacterial killing and, in pathologic circumstances, tissue damage. Integrins and selectins participate in neutrophil adhesion but may also play a role in intracellular signaling. The role of L-selectin in ROI production and Ca2+ signaling in suspended neutrophils was examined using the DREG series of anti-L-selectin antibodies. NADPH oxidase activation was assessed in three ways: H2O2 production using either scopoletin or dihydrorhodamine and O2- production using cytochrome c. Alterations in [Ca2+]i were measured using Fura 2-AM and fluorescence spectrophotometry. Cross-linking of L-selectin with DREG and 2 degrees antibody did not trigger production of H2O2 by itself but significantly enhanced the subsequent response to two soluble activating agents; the formyl peptide formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Potentiation of the oxidative burst was observed using F(ab')2 fragments but not with irrelevant antibodies and was observed whether 2 degrees antibody was added before or after fMLP. Cross-linking of L-selectin also triggered a rise in [Ca2+]i, due, in part, to release from intracellular stores. The intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA blocked both the rise in [Ca2+]i and the potentiation of the oxidative burst in response to fMLP or TNF. We conclude that cross-linking of L-selectin induces intracellular signals, including release of Ca2+, which may contribute to potentiation of the oxidative burst.

9794783|t|Signal transduction of stress via ceramide.
9794783|a|The sphingomyelin (SM) pathway is a ubiquitous, evolutionarily conserved signalling system analogous to conventional systems such as the cAMP and phosphoinositide pathways. Ceramide, which serves as second messenger in this pathway, is generated from SM by the action of a neutral or acidic SMase, or by de novo synthesis co-ordinated through the enzyme ceramide synthase. A number of direct targets for ceramide action have now been identified, including ceramide-activated protein kinase, ceramide-activated protein phosphatase and protein kinase Czeta, which couple the SM pathway to well defined intracellular signalling cascades. The SM pathway induces differentiation, proliferation or growth arrest, depending on the cell type. Very often, however, the outcome of signalling through this pathway is apoptosis. Mammalian systems respond to diverse stresses with ceramide generation, and recent studies show that yeast manifest a form of this response. Thus ceramide signalling is an older stress response system than the caspase/apoptotic death pathway, and hence these two pathways must have become linked later in evolution. Signalling of the stress response through ceramide appears to play a role in the development of human diseases, including ischaemia/reperfusion injury, insulin resistance and diabetes, atherogenesis, septic shock and ovarian failure. Further, ceramide signalling mediates the therapeutic effects of chemotherapy and radiation in some cells. An understanding of the mechanisms by which ceramide regulates physiological and pathological events in specific cells may provide new targets for pharmacological intervention.

21448658|t|The creatine kinase system and pleiotropic effects of creatine.
21448658|a|The pleiotropic effects of creatine (Cr) are based mostly on the functions of the enzyme creatine kinase (CK) and its high-energy product phosphocreatine (PCr). Multidisciplinary studies have established molecular, cellular, organ and somatic functions of the CK/PCr system, in particular for cells and tissues with high and intermittent energy fluctuations. These studies include tissue-specific expression and subcellular localization of CK isoforms, high-resolution molecular structures and structure-function relationships, transgenic CK abrogation and reverse genetic approaches. Three energy-related physiological principles emerge, namely that the CK/PCr systems functions as (a) an immediately available temporal energy buffer, (b) a spatial energy buffer or intracellular energy transport system (the CK/PCr energy shuttle or circuit) and (c) a metabolic regulator. The CK/PCr energy shuttle connects sites of ATP production (glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation) with subcellular sites of ATP utilization (ATPases). Thus, diffusion limitations of ADP and ATP are overcome by PCr/Cr shuttling, as most clearly seen in polar cells such as spermatozoa, retina photoreceptor cells and sensory hair bundles of the inner ear. The CK/PCr system relies on the close exchange of substrates and products between CK isoforms and ATP-generating or -consuming processes. Mitochondrial CK in the mitochondrial outer compartment, for example, is tightly coupled to ATP export via adenine nucleotide transporter or carrier (ANT) and thus ATP-synthesis and respiratory chain activity, releasing PCr into the cytosol. This coupling also reduces formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibits mitochondrial permeability transition, an early event in apoptosis. Cr itself may also act as a direct and/or indirect anti-oxidant, while PCr can interact with and protect cellular membranes. Collectively, these factors may well explain the beneficial effects of Cr supplementation. The stimulating effects of Cr for muscle and bone growth and maintenance, and especially in neuroprotection, are now recognized and the first clinical studies are underway. Novel socio-economically relevant applications of Cr supplementation are emerging, e.g. for senior people, intensive care units and dialysis patients, who are notoriously Cr-depleted. Also, Cr will likely be beneficial for the healthy development of premature infants, who after separation from the placenta depend on external Cr. Cr supplementation of pregnant and lactating women, as well as of babies and infants are likely to be of benefit for child development. Last but not least, Cr harbours a global ecological potential as an additive for animal feed, replacing meat- and fish meal for animal (poultry and swine) and fish aqua farming. This may help to alleviate human starvation and at the same time prevent over-fishing of oceans.

27359203|t|Drinking pattern of wine and effects on human health: why should we drink moderately and with meals?
27359203|a|Conclusions of epidemiological studies examining the effects of alcoholic beverages on human health may be unclear and limited if they do not take into account drinking pattern parameters such as beverage type, regular moderate versus binge drinking and drinking with or without meals. This review considers different aspects of drinking patterns and effects on human health with special attention to wine. We particularly discuss the potential underlying mechanisms for epidemiological evidence that the beneficial effects of wine are more evident if consumed with food. In this context, we address the effects of food on blood alcohol concentration and acetaldehyde production in the gastrointestinal tract, the role of wine components and uric acid in counteracting the detrimental effects of postprandial oxidative stress, as well as wine's antimicrobial properties and its potential to act as a digestive aid. In addition to its biological correlates, drinking patterns with regard to different socio-cultural circumstances in different populations are also considered. In order to avoid confusion and misconceptions in the general population because of the hormetic associations of wine with human health, it is important that all medical and scientific information concerning the effect of wine consumption on human health are evidence-based and communicated in a competent, credible and unbiased manner. In conclusion, we propose several practical recommendations concerning wine consumption and consumer information to minimize the risks of alcohol-related harm and to encourage individual responsibility and a healthy lifestyle.

11040396|t|Increase of reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) species generated by phagocyting granulocytes related to age.
11040396|a|In this present paper the age-induced effect on reactive oxidizing species generated by oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) was studied using human phagocyting granulocytes. The ROS and RNS were quantified, respectively, in a chemiluminescence assay and by the measurement of nitrite production. The age-induced reactive oxidizing species generation was studied in healthy subjects ranging from 20 to 80 years old, divided into six age groups: group I, 20-29 years old; group II, 30-39 years old; group III, 40-49 years old; group IV, 50-59 years old; group V, 60-69 years old; and group VI, 70-80 years old. Our results demonstrate a parallelism between generation of the ROS and RNS induced by the age. A significant increase of ROS production was observed from 40 years old (age groups III, IV, V and VI while for RNS this increase was observed only from 50 years old (groups IV, V and VI). These data suggest an increase of oxidizing species generation (ROS/RNS) related to age. The increased generation of ROS (40-49 years old) was induced before the increasing of RNS (50-59 years old) and it may have consequences on inflammation and host defences.

24325458|t|Phytochemical attributes of four conventionally extracted medicinal plants and cytotoxic evaluation of their extracts on human laryngeal carcinoma (HEp2) cells.
24325458|a|The bioactive composition and cytotoxic and antioxidative/prooxidative effects of four medicinal plants: yarrow (Achillea millefolium L.), hawthorn (Crataegus oxyacantha L.), ground ivy (Glechoma hederacea L.), and olive (Olea europea L.) on human laryngeal carcinoma cell line (HEp2) were investigated. Water extracts of these plants obtained by infusion, maceration, and decoction were characterized for their polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity. Based on the extraction efficiency of polyphenols, the final extracts were obtained whose polyphenolic profile, polysaccharides, mineral content, and cytoprotective activities were determined. The overall highest content of polyphenols and antioxidant capacity was determined in hawthorn, followed by yarrow and ground ivy, and the lowest in olive leaves extract. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of phenolic acids, as the most abundant bioactive compounds, followed by flavonoids, flavons, and flavonols. All examined medicinal plants reduced the cell viability and reactive oxygen species formation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Ground ivy and yarrow containing a high content of phenolic acids and polysaccharides were more efficient to decrease the cell survival when compared to olive leaf and hawthorn. Experiments confirmed the importance of polyphenolic composition rather than content of investigated plants and revealed a relationship between the polyphenolic and polysaccharide contents and antioxidant/prooxidant characters of medicinal plants.

9817412|t|Oxidative stress in the human brain after subarachnoid hemorrhage.
9817412|a|OBJECT: The aim of this study was to verify the patterns of antioxidant enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in the human brain after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) to verify whether an "oxidative stress situation" characterizes the brain response to subarachnoid bleeding. METHODS: Forty samples of gyrus rectus or temporal operculum that were obtained during a surgical approach to anterior circulation aneurysms were used for this study. The activity of total SOD, GSH-Px, and the SOD/GSH/Px ratio (which expresses the balance between the production of hydrogen peroxides by dismutation of superoxide radicals and the scavenging potential) were calculated in each case. Twelve samples were obtained from patients who underwent surgery for unruptured aneurysms (control group); 13 samples were obtained during surgical procedures performed within 72 hours of SAH; and 15 samples were obtained during delayed surgical procedures (> 10 days post-SAH). Ten patients presented with clinical deterioration caused by arterial vasospasm. In both SAH groups, the mean total SOD activity was significantly higher than in the control group (p=0.029). The mean activity of GSH-Px did not differ significantly between the SAH and control groups (p=0.731). There was a significant increase in the SOD/GSH-Px ratio in both SAH groups, as compared with controls (p < 0.05). There was a significant correlation between the enzymatic activity and the clinical severity of the hemorrhage, with findings of lower values of SOD and, mainly, of the SOD/GSH-Px ratio in the poor-grade patients. The SOD/GSH-Px ratio was 2.14+/-0.44 in patients who presented with clinical vasospasm and 1.24+/-0.2 in cases without vasospasm. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show an imbalance of the antioxidant enzymatic activities in the human brain after SAH. which is linked to the severity of the initial bleeding and possibly modified by the development of arterial vasospasm.

8188534|t|The direct pituitary effect of testosterone to inhibit gonadotropin secretion in men is partially mediated by aromatization to estradiol.
8188534|a|In men, administration of exogenous testosterone (T) exerts direct negative feedback effects at the pituitary as well as at the hypothalamic level. This study was undertaken to determine whether T itself causes the inhibitory effects on the pituitary, or whether conversion to estradiol (E2) or dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is required. We assessed the biological activity of serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), as well as immunoactivity. Blood samples were drawn before, during, and after a continuous, 72-hour i.v. infusion of T (15 mg/day), E2 (90 micrograms/day), or DHT (500 micrograms/day). Each of these doses is twice the daily production rate of the steroid. Each man received each of the three steroid infusions. We studied four men, ages 23-35, with idiopathic hypothalamic hypogonadism (IHH), who were treated with pulsatile gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) until their gonadotropins reached the normal range. Serum levels of T, E2, DHT, and levels of immunologically active and biologically active LH and FSH were measured. We found that administration of each steroid increased serum levels of the infused steroid to the upper physiologic range. Administration of T or E2 resulted in decreased mean levels of biologically and immunologically active LH and FSH; administration of DHT did not alter gonadotropin secretion. These data suggest that some of the direct effect of T at the pituitary level in men is mediated by E2, whereas peripherally formed DHT may not play an important role in this process.

8052257|t|[Binding of a fragment of yeast phenylalanyl tRNA containing an anticodon loop with 30S and 70S ribosomes from Escherichia coli. The role of guanosine-42 in this interaction].
8052257|a|Poly(U)-dependent binding of isolated yeast tRNA(Phe) anticodon hairpin (15-nucleotide-long, corresponding to nucleotides 28-42 within the tRNA) and several its derivatives to the P site of Escherichia coli 30S and 70S ribosomes was studied quantitatively. The affinity for the hairpin binding to 70S ribosomes was shown to be only 30-fold weaker than that for the binding of total tRNA(Phe). Within the anticodon hairpin, removal of the 3'-terminal nucleotide corresponding to guanosine-42 in tRNA(Phe) decreases the association constant for the anticodon arm-ribosome interaction 15-fold. Replacement of this guanosine with other nucleosides does not affect the affinity, regardless of involvement in the hairpin secondary structure. These data indicate that G-42 affects the anticodon arm affinity most likely by forming a direct contact with the ribosome. One can assume that this nucleotide within intact tRNA also forms a contact with the P site. Since the 3'-terminal ribose modifications (oxidation, oxidation and reduction) as well as the presence or absence of the 3'-terminal phosphate does not affect the affinity of the anticodon arm fragment, the latter is obviously involved in the interaction through 3'-terminal nucleotide base groups which does not take part in base pairing.

8175964|t|Effect of dopamine2 blockade on renal function under varied sodium intake.
8175964|a|This study explored the role of the dopamine-2 receptor (DA2) in the control of renal blood flow (RBF) and the influence of variations in sodium intake. These relationships have not been previously defined in man. Seven normotensive male subjects underwent a low dose dopamine (DA) infusion (1 microgram/kg.min) for 3 h, known to activate both DA1 and DA2 receptors. The effect of DA2 receptor on renal hemodynamics was studied using a relatively specific DA2 blocker [domperidone (DOM); 60 mg, orally] alone and with a DA infusion. Systemic and renal hemodynamics parameters were measured noninvasively. Urinary prostacyclin was measured in 3-h urine specimens, obtained during the DA infusion. The DA infusion increased RBF and prostacyclin during both normal and high salt diets, but this effect was attenuated on a low salt diet. DOM alone significantly reduced basal RBF during normal (1304 +/- 48 vs. 1175 +/- 45 mL/min.1.73 m2; P < 0.01) and low salt diets (1402 +/- 80 vs. 1220 +/- 101 mL/min.1.73 m2; P < 0.02), but was without effect during high sodium intake. DOM had no effect on prostacyclin excretion at any level of salt intake. These results suggest that both DA1 and DA2 are activated in renal vessels by DA, and that DA2 receptors play a role in the renal vasodilating action of DA. Changes in sodium balance alter the actions of the two receptors (DA1 and DA2) in a coordinated fashion in the regulation of RBF.

3033435|t|Isolation of the yeast phosphoglyceromutase gene and construction of deletion mutants.
3033435|a|The PGM1 gene (also called GPM; Fraenkel 1982) coding for phosphoglyceromutase was isolated by functional complementation. When present on a multicopy vector and introduced into yeast cells it led to an about eightfold increase in specific enzymatic activity. This apparent overproduction was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of crude extracts and at the transcriptional level by Northern analysis. By subcloning of the yeast DNA insertions of the plasmids originally isolated the PGM1 coding region was located within a 1.3 kb SalI-HindIII fragment. Integration at the chromosomal locus confirmed that the PGM1 gene had indeed been isolated. Southern analysis of genomic digests showed the same restriction patterns as the cloned sequences. However, a BamHI restriction polymorphism was observed. Furthermore, a repetitive element was found in the PGM1 flanking region. Finally, the chromosomal copy of the gene was deleted by replacement with a URA3 marker. The deletion mutants showed that the gene is not essential for yeast growing in the presence of a combination of glycerol and ethanol. However, growth was inhibited by glucose and neither glycerol nor ethanol alone were sufficient to support growth.

9751938|t|Use of nitroglycerin for uterine relaxation.
9751938|a|Data from human and experimental animal research indicate that nitric oxide (NO), a novel messenger, formed during the nitric oxide synthase-catalyzed oxidation of L-arginine to L-citrulline, is involved in maintaining normal uterine tone during gestation. There are demonstrated and potential benefits of manipulating the L-arginine-NO system during pregnancy. Several recent case reports and case series have described the effective use of nitroglycerin (GTN), a NO donor compound, antenatally, intrapartum, and postpartum for acute uterine relaxation. Therapeutic indications for GTN range from facilitating external cephalic version, difficult vaginal or cesarean section delivery, and manual exploration of the uterus, to its use as a tocolytic. The intravenous regimen of GTN required to obtain the desired degree of uterine relaxation is extremely variable; intravenous bolus doses of 50 micrograms to 500 micrograms GTN with up to three repeated injections of 50 micrograms to 250 micrograms have been reported. Other methods of GTN administration include transdermal patches and sublingual spray. GTN, when used in low doses, may provide safe and effective uterine relaxation with no clinically apparent fetal or maternal adverse effects. However, clinical trials with use of objective methods of evaluating uterine tone and comparing GTN to other tocolytic agents are required before widespread use in advocated.

12182479|t|Heat resistance of juice spoilage microorganisms.
12182479|a|The heat resistance of various yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, Torulaspora delbrueckii, and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii), molds (Penicillium citrinum, Penicillium roquefortii, and Aspergillus niger), and lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus plantarum) obtained from spoiled acid or acidified food products was determined in 0.1 M citrate buffer at pH values of 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0. S. cerevisiae was the most heat resistant of the microorganisms in citrate buffer, and its heat resistance was further evaluated in apple, grapefruit, calcium-fortified apple, and tomato juices as well as in a juice base with high fructose corn syrup. Decimal reduction times (D-values) and changes in temperature required to change the D-value (z-values) for S. cerevisiae were higher in the juices than in citrate buffer at all pH values tested. The D57 degrees C(135 degrees F)-values varied from 9.4 min in the juice product with pH 2.8 to 32 min in a calcium-added apple juice with pH 3.9. The S. cerevisiae strain used in this study can be used in thermal-death-time experiments in acidic products to calculate process conditions and in challenge tests to validate the calculated temperatures and hold times during processing.

28848044|t|Regulation of mitochondrial protein import by the nucleotide exchange factors GrpEL1 and GrpEL2 in human cells.
28848044|a|Mitochondria are organelles indispensable for maintenance of cellular energy homeostasis. Most mitochondrial proteins are nuclearly encoded and are imported into the matrix compartment where they are properly folded. This process is facilitated by the mitochondrial heat shock protein 70 (mtHsp70), a chaperone contributing to mitochondrial protein quality control. The affinity of mtHsp70 for its protein clients and its chaperone function are regulated by binding of ATP/ADP to mtHsp70's nucleotide-binding domain. Nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) play a crucial role in exchanging ADP for ATP at mtHsp70's nucleotide-binding domain, thereby modulating mtHsp70's chaperone activity. A single NEF, Mge1, regulates mtHsp70's chaperone activity in lower eukaryotes, but the mammalian orthologs are unknown. Here, we report that two putative NEF orthologs, GrpE-like 1 (GrpEL1) and GrpEL2, modulate mtHsp70's function in human cells. We found that both GrpEL1 and GrpEL2 associate with mtHsp70 as a hetero-oligomeric subcomplex and regulate mtHsp70 function. The formation of this subcomplex was critical for conferring stability to the NEFs, helped fine-tune mitochondrial protein quality control, and regulated crucial mtHsp70 functions, such as import of preproteins and biogenesis of Fe-S clusters. Our results also suggested that GrpEL2 has evolved as a possible stress resistance protein in higher vertebrates to maintain chaperone activity under stress conditions. In conclusion, our findings support the idea that GrpEL1 has a role as a stress modulator in mammalian cells and highlight that multiple NEFs are involved in controlling protein quality in mammalian mitochondria.

9065433|t|Dimerization and activation of the herpes simplex virus type 1 protease.
9065433|a|The quaternary state of the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) protease has been analyzed in relation to its catalytic activity. The dependence of specific activity upon enzyme concentration indicated that association of the 27-kDa subunits strongly increased activity. Size-exclusion chromatography identified the association as a monomer-dimer equilibrium. Isolation of monomeric and dimeric species from a size-exclusion column followed by immediate assay identified the dimer as the active form of the enzyme. Activation of the protease by antichaotropic cosolvents correlated with changes in the monomer-dimer equilibrium. Thus, dimerization of the enzyme was enhanced in solvents containing glycerol or the anions citrate or phosphate. These are substances previously identified as activators of HSV-1 protease (Hall, D. L., and Darke, P. L. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 22697-22700). The relative potencies of these cosolvents as enzyme activators correlated with their efficiency in promoting dimerization. Under all solvent conditions examined, the dependence of specific activity upon enzyme concentration was consistent with a kinetic model in which only the dimer is active. Dissociation constants for the HSV-1 protease dimer determined with this model at 15 degrees C, pH 7.5, were 964 and 225 nM in 20% glycerol with 0.2 and 0.5 M citrate present, respectively. The activation of the HSV-1 protease by antichaotropic cosolvents was hereby shown to be similar in nature to the activation of the other well characterized herpesvirus protease, that from human cytomegalovirus.

24854273|t|The human response to acute enteral and parenteral phosphate loads.
24854273|a|The human response to acute phosphate (PO4) loading is poorly characterized, and it is unknown whether an intestinal phosphate sensor mechanism exists. Here, we characterized the human mineral and endocrine response to parenteral and duodenal acute phosphate loads. Healthy human participants underwent 36 hours of intravenous (IV; 1.15 [low dose] and 2.30 [high dose] mmol of PO4/kg per 24 hours) or duodenal (1.53 mmol of PO4/kg per 24 hours) neutral sodium PO4 loading. Control experiments used equimolar NaCl loads. Maximum PO4 urinary excretory responses occurred between 12 and 24 hours and were similar for low-dose IV and duodenal infusion. Hyperphosphatemic responses were also temporally and quantitatively similar for low-dose IV and duodenal PO4 infusion. Fractional renal PO4 clearance increased approximately 6-fold (high-dose IV group) and 4-fold (low-dose IV and duodenal groups), and significant reductions in plasma PO4 concentrations relative to peak values occurred by 36 hours, despite persistent PO4 loading. After cessation of loading, frank hypophosphatemia occurred. The earliest phosphaturic response occurred after plasma PO4 and parathyroid hormone concentrations increased. Plasma fibroblast growth factor-23 concentration increased after the onset of phosphaturia, followed by a decrease in plasma 1,25(OH)2D levels; α-Klotho levels did not change. Contrary to results in rodents, we found no evidence for intestinal-specific phosphaturic control mechanisms in humans. Complete urinary phosphate recovery in the IV loading groups provides evidence against any important extrarenal response to acute PO4 loads.

7201507|t|Weakening of the blood-brain barrier by alcohol-related stresses in the rat.
7201507|a|The product of the permeability x vascular surface area (PA) of the blood-brain barrier to [14C]sucrose has been measured in rats maintained for 3 weeks in a chamber, the air supply to which carried a controlled concentration of ethanol vapour. No statistically significant difference was found between the permeability measurements in rats inhaling ethanol vapour for 3 weeks and non-alcohol exposed rats. The PA value was found to be significantly increased (115%) in rats given the same ethanol exposure when additionally subject to starvation during the last 3 days of this treatment. If the ethanol supply was also withdrawn at the same time as the food, a similar significant increase (116%) in PA value was found. In the absence of any ethanol exposure, 3 days' starvation did not significantly alter the measured PA value. Finally, when rats are given 200 mg/kg disulfiram every second day during a 2-week period of ethanol inhalation, the PA value was not significantly altered, although the concentration of acetaldehyde in the blood was up to 129 microM. The results indicate that while ethanol or acetaldehyde alone do not cause a weakening in the blood-brain barrier, the additional stress of food withdrawal after alcohol exposure does reduce barrier function, and this could be significant in human binge drinking.

3333401|t|Spandra: a sustained release battlefield wound dressing.
3333401|a|In 1981, our laboratories developed a family of elastomers which could be cured by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Curing by UV radiation was a significant advance in chemistry, since it allowed ultra-fast curing of elastomers in a matter of seconds, as compared to several hours at 110 degrees C for conventional heat curing. We applied for a patent based on this technology, and the patent was allowed in mid-1984 [29]. Based on this technology, Thermedics submitted a proposal to the US Army for the development of a sustained-release battlefield wound dressing containing antibiotics and coagulants. The drugs were evenly distributed in the oligomer matrix, and subsequently cured in seconds under UV illumination, without the use of heat, organic solvents or water. Because delicate drugs are not subjected to heat, organic solvents or water, the pharmacological activity of the drugs is insured. Therefore, theoretically any drug may be incorporated into our dressing. Sustained release dressings were first developed at Thermedics in 1983, spurred by a contract from the US Army Medical Research and Development Command. Under this contract, the Company developed a new type of wound dressing capable of accelerating the healing process, retarding infection, and minimizing pain. Based on our TECOFLEX materials technology, the dressing performs like temporary artificial skin. Its transmission properties for oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor are similar to those of intact skin. Thus, while excluding bacteria from the wound site, the dressing maintains an optimal moist environment for the promotion of rapid healing. The new drawing shown in Figure 10 minimizes pain during healing by preventing dehydration and shrinkage in the wound. Patient comfort is also enhanced by the incorporation of a special fabric which imparts flex properties to the bandage that are almost identical to those of human skin, with greater stretch in one direction than in another. This also facilitates application to complex body contours by only one attendant, an important feature in both hospital and emergency situations. Materials currently in use in hospitals are difficult to handle, requiring two or three nurses to apply large dressings. Thermedics' military wound dressing not only has the significant advantage of ease of application, but this dressing can also be used for delivery of drugs to a specific site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

1331090|t|Purification and characterization of Rac 2. A cytosolic GTP-binding protein that regulates human neutrophil NADPH oxidase.
1331090|a|Human neutrophils and other phagocytes generate superoxide anion (O2-) as a means of destroying ingested microorganisms. O2- is produced by an NADPH-consuming oxidase composed of membrane and cytosolic components. Activation of the NADPH oxidase is absolutely dependent upon GTP, indicating the requirement for a GTP-binding protein in this process. We have utilized a five-step chromatographic procedure to isolate a GTP-binding protein from human neutrophil cytosol which can stimulate NADPH oxidase activity in a cell-free assay. Oxidase enhancing activity was shown to coisolate with this GTP-binding component, which was purified to apparent homogeneity. The GTP-binding protein was identified as Rac 2 by immunological reactivity and amino acid sequencing. Thus, Rac 2 appears to be a third cytosolic component required for human neutrophil NADPH oxidase activation. Recombinant Rac 2 was shown to bind guanine nucleotides in a Mg(2+)-dependent fashion. GDP dissociation rates were determined and shown to be regulated by the free Mg2+ concentration. Rac 2 was found to possess the highest rate of intrinsic GTP hydrolysis of any of the characterized members of the Ras superfamily. The biochemical properties of Rac 2 indicate it is likely to be subject to regulatory cofactors in vivo.

7346384|t|[Hemoglobins, XLIII: The primary structure of mole hemoglobin (Talpa europaea) (author's transl)].
7346384|a|The hemoglobin of the european mole (Talpa europaea) has only one component. The alpha- and beta-chains were separated by chromatography on CM 52 cellulose. The primary structures of both chains were mainly established on the tryptic peptides by automatic Edman degradation. The N-terminal regions were sequenced on the chains. Large C-terminal peptides could be isolated and sequenced after acidic hydrolysis of the Asp-Pro bond (alpha: 94/95, beta: 99/100). The peptides were aligned by their homology with human alpha- and beta-chains. A comparison with human hemoglobin shows an exchange of 18 amino acid residues in the alpha-chains and of 30 in the beta-chains. The substitutions in the surroundings of the heme and the contacts between the subunits are discussed. All amino acid residues responsible for the binding of 2,3-dihosphoglycerate are present. Nevertheless a high oxygen affinity and a reduced interaction with diphosphoglycerate are found in mole hemoglobin (Jelkmann, W., Oberthür, W., Kleinschmidt, T. & Braunitzer, G. (1981) Respir. Physiol., in press). According to the sequence a relaxed structure of the central cavity between the beta-chains can be the reason for the low interaction between phosphate and protein. The oxygen affinity is not only affected by the presence of diphosphoglycerate-binding sites in hemoglobin but also by the structure in this region of the molecule.

2132749|t|A plasma factor inhibiting erythrocyte magnesium efflux.
2132749|a|When incubated at 37 degrees C for 5 h in a magnesium- and calcium-free phosphate buffer solution (PBS), rat and mouse erythrocytes lose 30-40% of their Mg content. However, no Mg loss is observed if these erythrocytes are incubated in their own plasma. In order to investigate this phenomenon, murine erythrocytes were incubated in PBS, in human and murine blood plasmas, and fetal calf serum diluted in PBS (1/4), and in PBS supplemented with MgCl2, CaCl2, and crystallized plasma proteins at concentrations equal to those obtained in plasma/PBS solutions. Erythrocyte Mg efflux was significantly inhibited (P = 10(-8] by diluted human and rat plasmas but the time course of this inhibition was different with these two kinds of plasmas (P = 10(-4]. Mouse plasma and fetal calf serum also entailed a significant inhibition of Mg efflux, while the addition of Mg, Ca, and purified plasma proteins in the incubation medium had little effect. Blood plasma thus contains a factor inhibiting Mg efflux from murine erythrocytes and this effect is not explained by its content of magnesium, calcium, and proteins.

19125910|t|Use of Tris-hydroxymethyl aminomethane in severe lactic acidosis due to highly active antiretroviral therapy: a case report.
19125910|a|BACKGROUND: Lactic acidosis is a rare, yet life-threatening adverse drug effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), specifically stavudine and lamivudine. These nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are commonly used to treat patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). CASE: We report the use of Tris-hydroxymethyl aminomethane (THAM) to treat severe lactic acidosis due to HAART in a 50-year-old African-American woman. NRTIs can cause hyperlactinaemia by interfering with mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation function, which normally removes H(+) generated by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate. This side-effect is associated with a high mortality in patients infected with HIV. One explanation for this high mortality is that lactic acidosis is typically refractory to treatment with commonly used buffering agents. CONCLUSION: THAM generates serum bicarbonate, and reduces the level of carbon dioxide in arterial blood. Both of these qualities appear to make THAM an ideal agent for treating lactic acidosis caused by HAART.

9502797|t|dSLo interacting protein 1, a novel protein that interacts with large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels.
9502797|a|Large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (BK channels) are activated by depolarized membrane potential and elevated levels of intracellular calcium. BK channel activity underlies the fast afterhyperpolarization that follows an action potential and attenuates neurotransmitter and hormone secretion. Using a modified two-hybrid approach, the interaction trap, we have identified a novel protein from Drosophila, dSLIP1 (dSLo interacting protein), which specifically interacts with Drosophila and human BK channels and has partial homology to the PDZ domain of alpha1 syntrophin. The dSLIP1 and dSlo mRNAs are expressed coincidently throughout the Drosophila nervous system, the two proteins interact in vitro, and they may be coimmunoprecipitated from transfected cells. Coexpression of dSLIP1 with dSlo or hSlo BK channels in Xenopus oocytes results in reduced currents as compared with expression of BK channels alone; current amplitudes may be rescued by coexpression with the channel domain that interacts with dSLIP1. Single-channel recordings and immunostaining of transfected tissue culture cells suggest that dSLIP1 selectively reduces Slo BK currents by reducing the number of BK channels in the plasma membrane.

19383551|t|Mechanisms of primary cancer prevention by butyrate and other products formed during gut flora-mediated fermentation of dietary fibre.
19383551|a|Dietary fibres are indigestible food ingredients that reach the colon and are then fermented by colonic bacteria, resulting mainly in the formation of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate. Those SCFA, especially butyrate, are recognised for their potential to act on secondary chemoprevention by slowing growth and activating apoptosis in colon cancer cells. Additionally, SCFA can also act on primary prevention by activation of different drug metabolising enzymes. This can reduce the burden of carcinogens and, therefore, decrease the number of mutations, reducing cancer risk. Activation of GSTs by butyrate has been studied on mRNA, protein, and enzyme activity level by real-time RT-PCR, cDNA microarrays, Western blotting, or photometrical approaches, respectively. Butyrate had differential effects in colon cells of different stages of cancer development. In HT29 tumour cells, e.g., mRNA GSTA4, GSTP1, GSTM2, and GSTT2 were induced. In LT97 adenoma cells, GSTM3, GSTT2, and MGST3 were induced, whereas GSTA2, GSTT2, and catalase (CAT) were elevated in primary colon cells. Colon cells of different stages of carcinogenesis differed in post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms because butyrate increased protein levels of different GST isoforms and total GST enzyme activity in HT29 cells, whereas in LT97 cells, GST protein levels and activity were slightly reduced. Because butyrate increased histone acetylation and phosphorylation of ERK in HT29 cells, inhibition of histone deacetylases and the influence on MAPK signalling are possible mechanisms of GST activation by butyrate. Functional consequences of this activation include a reduction of DNA damage caused by carcinogens like hydrogen peroxide or 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) in butyrate-treated colon cells. Treatment of colon cells with the supernatant from an in vitro fermentation of inulin increased GST activity and decreased HNE-induced DNA damage in HT29 cells. Additional animal and human studies are needed to define the exact role of dietary fibre and butyrate in inducing GST activity and reducing the risk of colon cancer.

19531570|t|Ceramide regulates gemcitabine-induced senescence and apoptosis in human pancreatic cancer cell lines.
19531570|a|Bioactive sphingolipids are potent intracellular signaling molecules having profound effects on cell death, growth, and differentiation. Pharmacologic manipulation of sphingolipid levels could have a significant effect on the induction of apoptosis by anticancer agents, and thus, improve treatment efficacy. We observed that gemcitabine cannot completely kill AsPc1 and Panc1 human pancreatic cancer cells in culture; even at high concentrations of gemcitabine, 30% to 40% of the cells remain viable. By adding sphingomyelin to the culture medium, gemcitabine-induced cell death increased synergistically to >90%. Panc1 cells that survived high concentrations of gemcitabine had an increase in beta-galactosidase activity, a marker of senescence. The inclusion of sphingomyelin with gemcitabine reduced beta-galactosidase activity, as compared with cells treated with gemcitabine alone. Expression of p21(waf1/cip1) in both cell lines exposed to sphingomyelin, gemcitabine, and gemcitabine + sphingomyelin varied relative to the untreated group. C(8)-ceramide induced both cell death and senescence in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that gemcitabine induces senescence in pancreatic cancer cells and that sphingomyelin-enhanced chemosensitivity is achieved through reducing the induction of senescence by redirecting the cell to enter the apoptotic pathway. Ceramide levels seem to be critical to this decision, with cell cycle progression being uninhibited at low ceramide levels, senescence induced at moderate levels, and apoptosis initiated at high levels. Our results provide further evidence that targeting the sphingolipid metabolism is a means of enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents.

10483900|t|Physiological and anti-inflammatory roles of dietary fiber and butyrate in intestinal functions.
10483900|a|BACKGROUND: We investigated the effects of pectin, a soluble dietary fiber, on the morphological parameters of the small intestine. In addition, we tested the effects of butyrate enemas on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced experimental colitis. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were fed an elemental diet containing 2.5% pectin for 14 days, and several parameters were then determined. DSS-induced colitis was evoked by the oral administration of water containing 3% DSS for 10 days. The butyrate enema (3 mL of 100 mmol/L butyrate per day) was begun 7 days before the DSS treatment. Interleukin (IL)-8 secretion in the human intestinal epithelial cell line HT-29 was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Pectin feeding induced a significant increase in the villus height and crypt depth in the small intestine. These effects correlated with a significant increase in plasma enteroglucagon levels. Pretreatment with a butyrate enema significantly blocked the development of DSS-induced experimental colitis. In the in vitro experiment, sodium butyrate dose-dependently inhibited tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced IL-8 secretion in HT-29 cells. CONCLUSIONS: A trophic effect due to dietary fiber was directly observed. The generation of short-chain fatty acids and the induction of enteroglucagon release might play an important role in this process. Butyrate, one of the major metabolites of dietary fiber, exerted a potent anti-inflammatory effect both in vivo and in vitro. Dietary fiber may therefore play important roles in the regulation of normal and pathological conditions in the intestine.

12642358|t|Electron spin resonance characterization of vascular xanthine and NAD(P)H oxidase activity in patients with coronary artery disease: relation to endothelium-dependent vasodilation.
12642358|a|BACKGROUND: Increased inactivation of nitric oxide by superoxide (O2*-) contributes to endothelial dysfunction in patients with coronary disease (CAD). We therefore characterized the vascular activities of xanthine oxidase and NAD(P)H oxidase, 2 major O2*--producing enzyme systems, and their relationship with flow-dependent, endothelium-mediated vasodilation (FDD) in patients with CAD. METHODS AND RESULTS: Xanthine- and NAD(P)H-mediated O*.- formation was determined in coronary arteries from 10 patients with CAD and 10 controls by using electron spin resonance spectroscopy. Furthermore, activity of endothelium-bound xanthine oxidase in vivo and FDD of the radial artery were determined in 21 patients with CAD and 10 controls. FDD was measured before and after infusion of the antioxidant vitamin C (25 mg/min i.a.) to determine the portion of FDD inhibited by radicals. In coronary arteries from patients with CAD, xanthine- and NAD(P)H-mediated O2*- formation was increased compared with controls (xanthine: 12+/-2 versus 7+/-1 nmol O2*-/ microg protein; NADH: 11+/-1 versus 7+/-1 nmol O2*-/ microg protein; and NADPH: 12+/-2 versus 9+/-1 nmol O2*-/ microg protein; each P<0.05). Endothelium-bound xanthine oxidase activity was increased by >200% in patients with CAD (25+/-4 versus 9+/-1 nmol O2*-/ microL plasma per min; P<0.05) and correlated inversely with FDD (r=-0.55; P<0.05) and positively with the effect of vitamin C on FDD (r=0.54; P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The present study represents the first electron spin resonance measurements of xanthine and NAD(P)H oxidase activity in human coronary arteries and supports the concept that increased activities of both enzymes contribute to increased vascular oxidant stress in patients with CAD. Furthermore, the present study suggests that increased xanthine oxidase activity contributes to endothelial dysfunction in patients with CAD and may thereby promote the atherosclerotic process.

28579439|t|Serum Biomarkers of Erectile Dysfunction in Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review of Current Literature.
28579439|a|INTRODUCTION: Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common complication in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). However, the utility of serum biomarkers as clinical surrogates for the development and/or progression of ED is unknown. AIM: To summarize the current literature for serum biomarkers for ED in DM and emphasize areas for future research. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Human subject data demonstrating the utility of serum markers for the development and progression of ED in patients with DM. METHODS: We performed a systematic PubMed-Medline search in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) for articles published from January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2016 of serum biomarkers for development or progression of ED in patients with DM using erectile dysfunction [MeSH] AND (biomarkers [MeSH] or inflammation mediators [MeSH] or intercellular signaling peptides and proteins [MeSH] or cell adhesion molecules [MeSH]). A thorough review of these studies was completed. RESULTS: Of the 327 abstracts screened, 12 full-text studies were assessed and 1 study was excluded. Eleven studies assessing serum biomarkers for ED in patients with DM were included in this review. The most studied serum biomarkers for ED in men with DM included endothelial dysfunction markers such as serum E-selectin, endothelial progenitor cells, and endothelial microparticles and specific markers of inflammation such as interleukin-10, ratio of tumor necrosis factor-α to interleukin-10, and reactive oxygen species such as nitric oxide and malondialdehyde. Reliable serum biomarkers will enable earlier diagnosis and objective monitoring of disease progression and responses to treatment in patients with ED. CONCLUSION: Serum biomarkers for ED in men with DM are very limited. Future longitudinal studies with uniform patient characteristics are needed to evaluate the potential clinical use of serum biomarkers in men with DM for the development and progression of ED.

23224878|t|Regulation of sodium-calcium exchanger activity by creatine kinase.
23224878|a|It has been shown that in rat heart NCX1 exists in a macromolecular -complex including PKA, PKA-anchoring protein, PKC, and phosphatases PP1 and PP2A. In addition, several lines of evidence suggest that the interactions of the exchanger with other molecules are closely associated with its function in regulation of [Ca(2+)](i). NCX contains a large intracellular loop (NCXIL) that is responsible for regulating NCX activity. We used the yeast two-hybrid method to screen a human heart cDNA library and found that the C-terminal region of sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase (sMiCK) interacted with NCX1IL. Among the four creatine kinase (CK) isozymes, both sMiCK and the muscle-type cytosolic creatine kinase (CKM) co-immunoprecipitated with NCX1. Both sMiCK and CKM were able to produce a recovery in the decreased NCX1 activity that was lost under energy-compromised conditions. This regulation is mediated through a putative PKC phosphorylation site of sMiCK and CKM. The catalytic activity of sMiCK and CKM is not required for their regulation of NCX1 activity. Our results suggest a novel mechanism for the regulation of NCX1 activity and a novel role for CK.

21726526|t|Calmodulin and calcium differentially regulate the neuronal Nav1.1 voltage-dependent sodium channel.
21726526|a|Mutations in the neuronal Nav1.1 voltage-gated sodium channel are responsible for mild to severe epileptic syndromes. The ubiquitous calcium sensor calmodulin (CaM) bound to rat brain Nav1.1 and to the human Nav1.1 channel expressed by a stably transfected HEK-293 cell line. The C-terminal region of the channel, as a fusion protein or in the yeast two-hybrid system, interacted with CaM via a consensus C-terminal motif, the IQ domain. Patch clamp experiments on HEK1.1 cells showed that CaM overexpression increased peak current in a calcium-dependent way. CaM had no effect on the voltage-dependence of fast inactivation, and accelerated the inactivation kinetics. Elevating Ca(++) depolarized the voltage-dependence of fast inactivation and slowed down the fast inactivation kinetics, and for high concentrations this effect competed with the acceleration induced by CaM alone. Similarly, the depolarizing action of calcium antagonized the hyperpolarizing shift of the voltage-dependence of activation due to CaM overexpression. Fluorescence spectroscopy measurements suggested that Ca(++) could bind the Nav1.1 C-terminal region with micromolar affinity.

26686105|t|Biocompatible cellulose-based superabsorbent hydrogels with antimicrobial activity.
26686105|a|Current superabsorbent hydrogels commercially applied in the disposable diapers have disadvantages such as weak mechanical strength, poor biocompatibility, and lack of antimicrobial activity, which may induce skin allergy of body. To overcome these hassles, we have developed novel cellulose based hydrogels via simple chemical cross-linking of quaternized cellulose (QC) and native cellulose in NaOH/urea aqueous solution. The prepared hydrogel showed superabsorbent property, high mechanical strength, good biocompatibility, and excellent antimicrobial efficacy against Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The presence of QC in the hydrogel networks not only improved their swelling ratio via electrostatic repulsion of quaternary ammonium groups, but also endowed their antimicrobial activity by attraction of sections of anionic microbial membrane into internal pores of poly cationic hydrogel leading to the disruption of microbial membrane. Moreover, the swelling properties, mechanical strength, and antibacterial activity of hydrogels strongly depended on the contents of quaternary ammonium groups in hydrogel networks. The obtained data encouraged the use of these hydrogels for hygienic application such as disposable diapers.

9430404|t|Alpha-tocopherol as a modulator of smooth muscle cell proliferation.
9430404|a|The effects of alpha-tocopherol and beta-tocopherol have been studied in rat and human aortic smooth muscle cells. Alpha-tocopherol, but not beta-tocopherol, inhibited smooth muscle cell proliferation and protein kinase C in a dose-dependent manner, at concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 microM. Beta-tocopherol added simultaneously with alpha-tocopherol prevented both proliferation and protein kinase C inhibition. Protein kinase C inhibition was cell cycle-dependent and it was prevented by okadaic acid, a protein phosphatase inhibitor. Protein kinase C activity measured from aortas of cholesterol-fed rabbits was also inhibited by alpha-tocopherol. By using protein kinase C (PKC) isoform-specific inhibitors and immunoprecipitation reactions it was found that PKC-alpha was selectively inhibited by alpha-tocopherol. Further, an activation of protein phosphatase 2A by alpha-tocopherol was found, which caused PKC-alpha dephosphorylation and inhibition. Ultimately, this cascade of events at the level of cell signal transduction leads to the inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation.

8227019|t|Purification and sequence of rat extracellular superoxide dismutase B secreted by C6 glioma.
8227019|a|An enzyme which converts radical oxygen, produced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate activated neutrophils, into nonluminescent products is secreted by rat C6 glioma. The enzyme was purified from chemically defined conditioned media and identified as an extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD). The purified enzyme is distinct from human EC-SOD C (Hjalmarsson, K., Marklund, S. L., Engström, A., and Edlund, T. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 6340-6344) by its elution from heparin-Sepharose at 300-400 mM NaCl, its pI of 6.1-7.2, and its native M(r) of 85,000 +/- 20,000. The rat EC-SOD is a dimer with a subunit M(r) of 34,000-36,000 and is extensively modified by post-translational processing. Although rat EC-SOD has a high sequence homology with the catalytic center and the polybasic heparin-binding site near the COOH terminus of human EC-SOD C, its NH2-terminal sequence and the sequences flanking the heparin-binding site differ substantially. The sequence of the isolated rat EC-SOD cDNA fully confirms the data obtained from amino acid sequence analysis. The amino acid sequence of the enzyme and its biochemical properties support its identification as the rat EC-SOD B.

11756431|t|Differential regulation of renal Na,K-ATPase by splice variants of the gamma subunit.
11756431|a|Sodium and potassium-exchanging adenosine triphosphatase (Na,K-ATPase) in the kidney is associated with the gamma subunit (gamma, FXYD2), a single-span membrane protein that modulates ATPase properties. Rat and human gamma occur in two splice variants, gamma(a) and gamma(b), with different N termini. Here we investigated their structural heterogeneity and functional effects on Na,K-ATPase properties. Both forms were post-translationally modified during in vitro translation with microsomes, indicating that there are four possible forms of gamma. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed Thr(2) and Ser(5) as potential sites for post-translational modification. Similar modification can occur in cells, with consequences for Na,K-ATPase properties. We showed previously that stable transfection of gamma(a) into NRK-52E cells resulted in reduction of apparent affinities for Na(+) and K(+). Individual clones differed in gamma post-translational modification, however, and the effect on Na(+) affinity was absent in clones with full modification. Here, transfection of gamma(b) also resulted in clones with or without post-translational modification. Both groups showed a reduction in Na(+) affinity, but modification was required for the effect on K(+) affinity. There were minor increases in ATP affinity. The physiological importance of the reduction in Na(+) affinity was shown by the slower growth of gamma(a), gamma(b), and gamma(b') transfectants in culture. The differential influence of the four structural variants of gamma on affinities of the Na,K-ATPase for Na(+) and K(+), together with our previous finding of different distributions of gamma(a) and gamma(b) along the rat nephron, suggests a highly specific mode of regulation of sodium pump properties in kidney.

9528652|t|In situ visualization of messenger RNA for basic fibroblast growth factor in living cells.
9528652|a|We examined whether messenger RNA for basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) could be visualized specifically by a fluorescent probe in living cells. A 15-nucleotide-long antisense or sense sequence for human bFGF was sandwiched between two complementary 5-nucleotide-long arm sequences. A fluorophore, 5-(2'-aminoethyl)aminonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (EDANS), was joined to the 5'-terminal phosphate, while 4-(4'-dimethylaminophenylazo)benzoic acid, quencher for EDANS, was joined to the 3'-terminal hydroxyl group. The probe emitted blue fluorescence only upon hybridization with the complementary 18-nucleotide-long sequence under ultraviolet light. The antisense or sense probe carried with liposome was delivered to human cells, trabecular cells of the eye, in a glass-bottom culture dish placed on the stage of an inverted microscope. Cells with the antisense probe did, but not with the sense probe, show blue fluorescence under ultraviolet light. The present study opens a way to measure the changing levels of a specific messenger RNA in living cells.

23347295|t|Elevated levels of thrombin-generating microparticles in stored red blood cells.
23347295|a|BACKGROUND: During storage, red blood cells (RBCs) lose their membrane stability, leading to haemolysis and microparticle (MP) formation. The use of RBCs stored for more than 28 days has been associated with an increased incidence of deep vein thrombosis. However, the exact mechanism by which coagulation activation is enhanced in stored RBCs is still unknown. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relevant potential procoagulant activities of MPs and study the relative procoagulant factors for initiating the coagulation on MPs in stored RBCs. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: MPs were isolated from the plasma of RBC units stored in citrate-phosphate-dextrose-adenine. At seven storage time-points (d0, d7, d14, d21, d28, d35 and d42), MPs were morphologically observed, quantified and analysed for tissue factor, factor XI (FXI) and their thrombin-generating potential. RESULTS: MPs were observed using electron microscopy. The size of the MPs ranged from 0·272 μm to 0·973 μm in diameter. During the storage of RBCs in plastic bags, the MP concentration increased from 3389 ± 218/μl at day 0 to 61 586 ± 2237/μl at d42. Thrombin generation was dependent on the total number of MPs (r = 0·987). Anti-human FXI antibody inhibited thrombin concentrations by 50·3% compared with control plasma, whereas antitissue factor and antitissue factor pathway inhibitor failed to reduce thrombin concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence that MP formation due to RBC storage might propagate coagulation not only by exposing phosphatidylserine, but also by initiating thrombin generation independently of tissue factor in a FXI -dependent manner.

3915752|t|Inhibition of the proteolytic contaminant in commercial xanthine oxidase preparations by serum protein fractions.
3915752|a|Commercial xanthine oxidase, widely used for generation of oxygen radicals in vitro, is usually contaminated by proteolytic activity, which limits its utility in studies of oxygen radical damage to protease sensitive substrates. An easily prepared fraction of fetal calf serum was found to inhibit virtually all of the proteolytic contaminant without affecting superoxide generation. The effects attainable with the "purified" enzyme were demonstrated with two protease sensitive targets: proteoglycan subunit from cartilage and fibronectin from human plasma.

10550050|t|An adenosine deaminase that generates inosine at the wobble position of tRNAs.
10550050|a|Several transfer RNAs (tRNAs) contain inosine (I) at the first position of their anticodon (position 34); this modification is thought to enlarge the codon recognition capacity during protein synthesis. The tRNA-specific adenosine deaminase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that forms I(34) in tRNAs is described. The heterodimeric enzyme consists of two sequence-related subunits (Tad2p/ADAT2 and Tad3p/ADAT3), both of which contain cytidine deaminase (CDA) motifs. Each subunit is encoded by an essential gene (TAD2 and TAD3), indicating that I(34) is an indispensable base modification in elongating tRNAs. These results provide an evolutionary link between the CDA superfamily and RNA-dependent adenosine deaminases (ADARs/ADATs).

25065941|t|A new Rhodamine B-based 'on-off' chemical sensor with high selectivity and sensitivity toward Fe(3+) and its imaging in living cells.
25065941|a|A new fluorescent chemosensor based on a Rhodamine B and pyrrole conjugate (RBPY) has been designed and synthesized. UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic studies show that RBPY exhibits a high selectivity and sensitivity toward Fe(3+) among many other metal cations in a MeOH/H2O solution (3:2, v/v, pH 7.10, HEPES buffer, 0.1mM) by forming a 1:1 complex with Fe(3+). Furthermore, results reveal that the formation of the RBPY-Fe(3+) complex is fully reversible in the presence of sulfide anions and could also be used as an efficient sensor for S(2-). Importantly, fluorescence microscopy experiments further demonstrated that RBPY can be utilized as a fluorescent probe for the detection of Fe(3+) in human liver (L-02) cells.

20683361|t|Sodium butyrate enhances the expression of baculovirus-mediated sodium/iodide symporter gene in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells.
20683361|a|OBJECTIVE: Increased expression of sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) is required for reporter gene imaging and effective radioiodine treatment of tumor. We investigated whether increased accumulation of iodine can be induced by sodium butyrate through a newly developed baculoviral transfer of the human NIS (hNIS) gene in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma. METHODS: A recombinant baculovirus [Bac-cytomegalovirus (CMV)-hNIS] encoding hNIS gene under the control of the CMV promoter was constructed. After A549 cells were transfected with Bac-CMV-hNIS in the presence of sodium butyrate, the expression of hNIS protein was detected by immunofluorescence and western blot analysis. The uptake and efflux of iodine were determined after the incubation of the transfected cells with I-iodide in the presence or absence of sodium butyrate. RESULTS: Immunocytochemical staining and western blot analysis showed increased hNIS protein expression in A549 cells transfected with Bac-CMV-hNIS after sodium butyrate treatment. Bac-CMV-hNIS transfected A549 cells accumulated up to about nine times more I than nontransfected cells; the amount of I uptake increased in a sodium butyrate in dose-dependent manner (P<0.001). However, rapid efflux of radioactivity was observed, with 50% lost during the first 2 min after I-containing medium had been replaced by a nonradioactive medium. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that an improved efficiency of baculovirus-mediated hNIS reporter gene imaging in lung adenocarcinoma is possible with treatment with sodium butyrate. However, additional conditions need to be defined to reduce the rapid efflux of radioiodine for the purpose of radionuclide therapy.

25343515|t|Diet is a major factor governing the fecal butyrate-producing community structure across Mammalia, Aves and Reptilia.
25343515|a|Butyrate-producing bacteria have an important role in maintaining host health. They are well studied in human and medically associated animal models; however, much less is known for other Vertebrata. We investigated the butyrate-producing community in hindgut-fermenting Mammalia (n = 38), Aves (n = 8) and Reptilia (n = 8) using a gene-targeted pyrosequencing approach of the terminal genes of the main butyrate-synthesis pathways, namely butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase (but) and butyrate kinase (buk). Most animals exhibit high gene abundances, and clear diet-specific signatures were detected with but genes significantly enriched in omnivores and herbivores compared with carnivores. But dominated the butyrate-producing community in these two groups, whereas buk was more abundant in many carnivorous animals. Clustering of protein sequences (5% cutoff) of the combined communities (but and buk) placed carnivores apart from other diet groups, except for noncarnivorous Carnivora, which clustered together with carnivores. The majority of clusters (but: 5141 and buk: 2924) did not show close relation to any reference sequences from public databases (identity <90%) demonstrating a large 'unknown diversity'. Each diet group had abundant signature taxa, where buk genes linked to Clostridium perfringens dominated in carnivores and but genes associated with Ruminococcaceae bacterium D16 were specific for herbivores and omnivores. Whereas 16S rRNA gene analysis showed similar overall patterns, it was unable to reveal communities at the same depth and resolution as the functional gene-targeted approach. This study demonstrates that butyrate producers are abundant across vertebrates exhibiting great functional redundancy and that diet is the primary determinant governing the composition of the butyrate-producing guild.

3004324|t|Uptake, intracellular activity, and influence of rifampin on normal function of polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
3004324|a|Quinone and hydroquinone forms of rifampin accumulated in normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) (maximal cellular to extracellular concentration ratio [C/Emax] +/- standard error of the mean, 9.36 +/- 0.54 and 8.82 +/- 0.65, respectively, after 5 to 10 min) and chronic granulomatous disease PMN (C/Emax, 13.76 +/- 0.77 and 14.29, respectively). Uptake of rifampin was influenced by incubation temperature and extracellular pH but not by phorbol myristate acetate stimulation or metabolic inhibitors. At extracellular concentrations between 0.06 and 5.0 mg/liter, rifampin significantly reduced the number of staphylococci surviving inside chronic granulomatous disease PMN, thus compensating for the bactericidal defect inherent with this disease. Spontaneous migration and chemotaxis of normal PMN were unaffected by rifampin. However, phagocytosis of yeast particles and oxygen consumption of stimulated PMN were moderately depressed, and O2- production and chemiluminescence were significantly depressed in a dose-dependent manner. The bactericidal activity of normal PMN was not impaired. Inhibition of chemiluminescence and O2- release were also observed in a cell-free system. We conclude that rifampin possesses favorable characteristics for the effective elimination of intracellular microorganisms. Further studies are needed to evaluate the in vivo significance of ion scavenging by rifampin, which could be hazardous to immunocompromised patients.

2167076|t|Adenine nucleotide catabolism in human erythrocytes: pathways and regulation.
2167076|a|Studies are reviewed which show that in human erythrocytes the catabolism of AMP, leading to hypoxanthine, proceeds by way of AMP deaminase under physiological conditions as well as upon alkalinization and addition of deoxyadenosine. In contrast, the catabolism induced by glucose deprivation, proceeds for 75% via dephosphorylation of AMP. These findings can be explained by the kinetic properties of erythrocytic AMP deaminase, which were investigated at concentrations of substrate and effectors in the physiological range.

9381409|t|Effect of a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor on DNA breakage and cytotoxicity induced by hydrogen peroxide and gamma-radiation.
9381409|a|The activity of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is activated upon recognition of DNA strand breaks by its DNA-binding domain and the stimulation of this nuclear enzyme seems to be an early response of cells exposed to a variety of different DNA-damaging agents. In the present work we evaluate the effect of hydrogen peroxide and gamma-radiation on DNA strand breaks in human leukocytes in the presence and in the absence of 3-aminobenzamide (3AB), a potent inhibitor of PARP. Our results have shown differences in the role poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in the rejoining of DNA strand breaks induced by hydrogen peroxide and gamma-radiation. We observed a PARP-dependent recovery of DNA strand breaks at the incubation time of 20-30 min in leukocytes treated with hydrogen peroxide. The repair of DNA strand breaks induced by gamma-radiation seems to be dependent on oxygen radical scavenging and the stimulation of PARP could be related to the protection of DNA strand breaks from hydroxyl radicals.

21607583|t|Estrogen receptor-α and sex steroid hormones regulate Toll-like receptor-9 expression and invasive function in human breast cancer cells.
21607583|a|Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) is a cellular DNA-receptor, which is widely expressed in cancer. Synthetic TLR9-ligands induce cancer cell invasion in vitro, but the role of TLR9 in cancer pathophysiology remains unclear. Increased TLR9 expression has been, however, detected in estrogen receptor negative (ER-) breast cancers. In this study, we investigated the effects of ERα expression and sex steroid hormones on TLR9 expression in human ER+ (MCF-7, T47-D) and ER- (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cell lines in vitro. We also studied TLR9 mRNA expression in archival breast cancer specimens (n = 12) with qRT-PCR, using primer sets that detect only the TLR9A isoform or the isoforms A and B (TLR9A/B). The TLR9 mRNA expression was detected in 10/12 specimens with both primer sets, and in 1/12 with only the TLR9A or the TLR9A/B primer sets. The basal TLR9 mRNA expression levels were significantly lower in the ER+ cell lines as compared with the ER- MDA-MB-231 cells. The transfection of ERα cDNA into MDA-MB-231 cells also resulted in down-regulation of TLR9 expression. While sex steroids had no effect on TLR9 expression in MCF-7 cells, testosterone (10(-8) M) induced TLR9 expression in MDA-MB-231 and T47-D cells. Although bicalutamide blocked this testosterone effect in MDA-MB-231 cells, in T47-D cells bicalutamide increased TLR9 expression and only partially blocked the testosterone effects. Estradiol (10(-8) M) induced TLR9 expression in T47-D cells. The invasive effects of synthetic TLR9-ligands were augmented by testosterone in vitro. This effect was lost in TLR9 siRNA MDA-MB-231 cells and also decreased by over-expression of ERα, which also inhibited NF-κB activation by TLR9-ligands. In conclusion, expression of TLR9 isoforms A and B can be detected in clinical breast cancer specimens. The ERα and sex steroid hormones regulate TLR9 expression and invasive effects in the breast cancer cells. Also, the commonly used hormonal cancer therapy bicalutamide affects TLR9 expression.

20026164|t|Nitric oxide mitigates apoptosis in human endothelial cells induced by 9,10-phenanthrenequinone: role of proteasomal function.
20026164|a|It has been widely recognized that nitric oxide (NO) suppresses oxidative damage of endothelial cell, but little is known about its pathophysiological role in apoptotic induction by 9,10-phenanthrenequinone (9,10-PQ), a major quinone component in diesel exhaust particles. Here, we have investigated the change in NO level in human aortic endothelial cells and the effect of NO in each step of apoptotic signaling initiated by 9,10-PQ. Treatment with 9,10-PQ evoked a bell-shaped production of NO, which was presumably due to increase in an active form of endothelial NO synthase. Pretreatment with exogenous NO decreased the susceptibility of the cells to 9,10-PQ, and retrieved from apoptotic signaling (reactive oxygen species generation, glutathione depletion and caspase activation) induced during exposure to high concentrations of 9,10-PQ. In addition, inhibition of endogenous NO production augmented the toxicity of 9,10-PQ. Interestingly, the 9,10-PQ treatment resulted in marked decreases in the proteasomal activities, which were partially abrogated by NO and a cell-permeable cGMP analog. These results indicate that proteasomal dysfunction by oxidative stress participates in the 9,10-PQ-induced apoptotic signaling and is ameliorated by NO via a cGMP-dependent pathway, thereby suggesting the protective role of NO in vascular damage caused by 9,10-PQ.

12423250|t|Brief, repeated exposure to substrates down-regulates dopamine transporter function in Xenopus oocytes in vitro and rat dorsal striatum in vivo.
12423250|a|In heterologous expression systems, dopamine transporter (DAT) cell-surface localization is reduced after relatively prolonged exposure to d-amphetamine (AMPH) or dopamine (DA), suggesting a role for substrate-mediated regulation of transporter function. Here, we investigated whether brief, repeated periods of substrate exposure modulated transporter function, first, in an in vitro model system and, second, in intact rat brain. In human DAT-expressing Xenopus laevis oocytes, repeated exposure to low micromolar concentrations of DA, AMPH or tyramine markedly reduced transport-mediated currents. This functional down-regulation was attenuated by inclusion of a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor and probably reflects DAT redistribution, as cell-surface [3H]WIN 35 428 binding was significantly lower following DA exposure. High-speed chronoamperometry was used to measure clearance of exogenously applied DA in dorsal striatum (STR) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) of anesthetized rats. In STR, frequent (every 2 min) applications of DA altered DA clearance parameters in a manner consistent with profound down-regulation of DAT function. Similar changes were not observed in NAc or after repeated vehicle (ascorbic acid) application. Together, our results suggest that brief, repeated periods of substrate exposure lead to rapid down-regulation of DAT activity and that this type of regulation can occur in vivo in STR, but not NAc.

18056282|t|Design and profiling of GS-9148, a novel nucleotide analog active against nucleoside-resistant variants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1, and its orally bioavailable phosphonoamidate prodrug, GS-9131.
18056282|a|GS-9148 [(5-(6-amino-purin-9-yl)-4-fluoro-2,5-dihydro-furan-2-yloxymethyl)phosphonic acid] is a novel ribose-modified human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) nucleotide reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor (NRTI) selected from a series of nucleoside phosphonate analogs for its favorable in vitro biological properties including (i) a low potential for mitochondrial toxicity, (ii) a minimal cytotoxicity in renal proximal tubule cells and other cell types, (iii) synergy in combination with other antiretrovirals, and (iv) a unique resistance profile against multiple NRTI-resistant HIV-1 strains. Notably, antiviral resistance analysis indicated that neither the K65R, L74V, or M184V RT mutation nor their combinations had any effect on the antiretroviral activity of GS-9148. Viruses carrying four or more thymidine analog mutations showed a substantially smaller change in GS-9148 activity relative to that observed with most marketed NRTIs. GS-9131, an ethylalaninyl phosphonoamidate prodrug designed to maximize the intracellular delivery of GS-9148, is a potent inhibitor of multiple subtypes of HIV-1 clinical isolates, with a mean 50% effective concentration of 37 nM. Inside cells, GS-9131 is readily hydrolyzed to GS-9148, which is further phosphorylated to its active diphosphate metabolite (A. S. Ray, J. E. Vela, C. G. Boojamra, L. Zhang, H. Hui, C. Callebaut, K. Stray, K.-Y. Lin, Y. Gao, R. L. Mackman, and T. Cihlar, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 52:648-654, 2008). GS-9148 diphosphate acts as a competitive inhibitor of RT with respect to dATP (K(i) = 0.8 muM) and exhibits low inhibitory potency against host polymerases including DNA polymerase gamma. Oral administration of GS-9131 to beagle dogs at a dose of 3 mg/kg of body weight resulted in high and persistent levels of GS-9148 diphosphate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (with a maximum intracellular concentration of >9 microM and a half-life of >24 h). This favorable preclinical profile makes GS-9131 an attractive clinical development candidate for the treatment of patients infected with NRTI-resistant HIV.

16219713|t|Acute regulation of circulating parathyroid hormone (PTH) molecular forms by calcium: utility of PTH fragments/PTH(1-84) ratios derived from three generations of PTH assays.
16219713|a|CONTEXT: The quantitative evaluation of circulating PTH peaks revealed by PTH assays after HPLC separation constitutes the best way to study the behavior of PTH molecular forms, but it is also impractical. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate the regulation of circulating PTH molecular forms by calcium through the use of PTH fragments/PTH (1-84) ratios derived from PTH assays with different specificities before and after HPLC separation of circulating PTH. DESIGN: CaCl2 and Na citrate were infused in eight volunteers. PTH was measured in serum and HPLC fractions at different calcium concentrations in PTH assays reacting with regions 1-2 (CA), 12-18 (T), and 65-69 (C) of the PTH structure. RESULTS: From hypo- to hypercalcemia, the C/CA ratio had the highest range (1.92 to 9.75; P < 0.001), and the C/T ratio had a higher range (1.69 to 6.11; P < 0.01) than the T/CA ratio (1.15 to 1.86). Human (h) PTH (1-84) represented 32.7 and 4.3% of circulating PTH in hypo- and hypercalcemic HPLC profiles, respectively. These numbers were 5 and 0.9% for amino-terminal (N)-PTH, an amino-terminal form of PTH distinct from hPTH (1-84), 7.3 and 6.8% for non-(1-84) PTH or large C-PTH fragments with a partially preserved N structure, and 54.9 and 88.1% for C-PTH fragments missing a N structure. The HPLC C-PTH fragments to hPTH (1-84) ratio had the most extensive range (1.67 to 20.58). Despite their quantitative differences, all ratios identified identical behavior of PTH fragments relative to PTH (1-84). CONCLUSIONS: PTH assay ratios are an adequate tool to investigate the modulation of PTH molecular forms, even if all PTH assays show some undesirable cross-reactivity with certain circulating forms of PTH.

16347743|t|Escherichia coli Spheroplast-Mediated Transfer of pBR322 Carrying the Cloned Ruminococcus albus Cellulase Gene into Anaerobic Mutant Strain FEM29 by Protoplast Fusion.
16347743|a|Intergeneric protoplast fusion between Escherichia coli HB101 with pBR322 carrying the cloned o-(carboxymethyl)cellulase (CMCase) gene of Ruminococcus albus (Pro Leu Ap Km) and an anaerobic mutant strain, FEM29 (Trp His Ap Km), with dehydrodivanillin-degrading activity was performed in the presence of 40% polyvinyl alcohol 300 under aerobic and anaerobic conditions to transfer the cloned cellulase gene into the mutant. The mutant FEM29 had a unique property. When it was incubated in liquid medium with 1% glucose and sucrose, protoplasts could be produced autogenously and regenerated on the agar slant. E. coli spheroplasts formed from a plasmid-amplified overnight culture after 10 min of treatment with lysozyme (20 mug/ml) in a hypertonic solution (0.01 M Tris hydrochloride [pH 7.5], 0.4 M mannitol). Protoplast regeneration rates of FEM29 and HB101 were 30 and 83%, respectively, on the agar-yeast extract medium. Ap Km fusants were obtained at high frequency: 1.7 x 10 anaerobically and 8.2 x 10 aerobically. These fusants showed 23 to 57% of CMCase and dehydrodivanillin-degrading activities, respectively, as compared with parental strains. All the fusants isolated were gram-negative rods with main phenotypes such as urease and catalase activities as in HB101 and esterase and chymotrypsin activities as in FEM29. Southern hybridization experiments suggested that pBR322 with the cloned CMCase gene existed autonomously in the fusant cells. This is the first report describing transfer of pBR322 with a cloned cellulase gene into an anaerobic mutant by polyvinyl alcohol-mediated fusion with an E. coli spheroplast.

14984179|t|Nitric oxide production by human peritoneal mesothelial cells.
14984179|a|Nitric oxide (NO) has multiple actions, ranging from immunomodulation to regulation of vascular tone and capillary flow. Thus NO generation within the peritoneum could potentially affect peritoneal transport by increasing capillary vasodilatation, and regulate the response to bacterial invasion. Peritoneal mesothelial cells have a common embryological derivation with endothelial cells. As mesothelial cells are the predominant cell type lining the peritoneal cavity, they could potentially be a major source of locally produced nitric oxide. Nitric oxide was measured using the Griess reaction, as total nitrite and nitrate, in fresh unused and spent dialysate effluent (SPDE) from both healthy peritoneal dialysis patients, and during episodes of bacterial peritonitis. Whereas fresh CAPD dialysate was nitrite free (5 +/- 0.1 microM), SPDE from a standard 4 h day time exchange contained 10.2 +/- 0.6 microM/L/h, and that from the overnight dwell 9.1 +/- 0.7 microM/L/h. During an episode of peritonitis, dialysate nitrite and nitrate increased significantly from 9.0 +/- 1.0 microM/L/h, when not infected to 17.5 +/- 2.4, from the first CAPD bag drained at presentation, and 15.2 +/- 1.8 for the second and 16.0 +/- 2.5 for the third exchange (p<0.01). By the following day nitrite levels had returned to baseline, 7.0 +/- 1.0 microM/L/h. Human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMC) were cultured and found to produce nitric oxide (261 nmol/mg cell protein), which increased in a dose dependent manner with the addition of spent uninfected CAPD dialysate. The addition of L-arginine, a NO substrate resulted in a 10% increase in nitric oxide production, whereas the addition of the blocker L-NMMA produced a 10% reduction. RNA for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was sought using northern blotting technique following combination stimulation with lipopolysaccharide and cytokines (IL-1beta, TNFalpha and gamma-INF, and/or spent dialysate from patients with bacterial peritonitis). However, we could not demonstrate RNA production for iNOS. Peritoneal mesothelial cells may be an important source of locally generated nitric oxide within the peritoneal cavity under basal conditions, but as they do not contain iNOS, the markedly increased NO production observed with episodes of acute bacterial peritonitis is more likely due to a combination of increased NO production by peritoneal macrophages and endothelial cells.

20024083|t|The influence of EDTA and citrate anticoagulant addition to human plasma on information recovery from NMR-based metabolic profiling studies.
20024083|a|The widely-used blood anticoagulants citrate and EDTA give rise to prominent peaks in (1)H NMR spectra of plasma samples collected in epidemiological and clinical studies, and these cause varying levels of interference in recovering biochemical information on endogenous metabolites. To investigate both the potential metabolic information loss caused by these substances and any possible inter-molecular interactions between the anticoagulants and endogenous components, the (1)H NMR spectra of 40 split human plasma samples collected from 20 individuals into either citrate or EDTA have been analysed. Endogenous metabolite peaks were selectively obscured by large citrate peaks or those from free EDTA and its calcium and magnesium complexes. It is shown that the endogenous metabolites that give rise to peaks obscured by those from EDTA or citrate almost invariably also have other resonances that allow their identification and potential quantitation. Also, metabolic information recovery could be maximised by use of spectral editing techniques such as spin-echo, diffusion-editing and J-resolved experiments. The NMR spectral effects of any interactions between the added citrate or EDTA and endogenous components were found to be negligible. Finally, identification of split samples was feasible using simple multivariate statistical approaches such as principal components analysis. Thus even when legacy epidemiological plasma samples have been collected using the NMR-inappropriate citrate or EDTA anticoagulants, useful biochemical information can still be recovered effectively.

625502|a|The partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide have been measured in hypertrophic scars in burned patients, using mass spectroscopy. The pO2 in scar tissue was significantly depressed in comparison to the pO2 in normal dermis (a decrease of 13.1 +/- 2.9 mm Hg). The pCO2 was noted to be increased in the scar tissue (2.6 +/- 1.6 mm Hg). The possible significance of these findings is discussed.

1679547|t|Mu-opioid-receptor-mediated inhibition of the N-type calcium-channel current.
1679547|a|The predominant consequences of mu-opioid-receptor activation are depression of both neuronal activity and transmitter release. Mu-Opioid agonists have previously been observed to increase a potassium conductance and to inhibit adenylate cyclase. We now report that activation of mu-opioid receptors directly decreases the N-type calcium-channel current in a differentiated, human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y). The coupling between the mu-opioid receptor and the calcium channel involves a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein and is independent of changes in adenylate cyclase activity. The inhibition of the calcium-channel current is voltage dependent because it is largely overcome by strong membrane depolarization. It is not associated with changes in the kinetics of current inactivation. Therefore, the mu-receptor belongs to the superfamily of G-protein-coupled, inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors which modulate the activity of calcium and potassium channels and adenylate cyclase.

14676945|t|Synergistic action of advanced glycation end products and endogenous nitric oxide leads to neuronal apoptosis in vitro: a new insight into selective nitrergic neuropathy in diabetes.
14676945|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We have previously shown that in diabetes nitrergic neurones innervating the urogenital and gastrointestinal organs undergo a selective degenerative process. This comprises an initial insulin-reversible decrease in neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in the axons, followed by apoptosis of the nitrergic neurones, a process that is not reversible by insulin. Since apoptosis was independent of serum glucose concentrations, and advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications, we have now measured AGEs in the serum and penis, pyloric sphincter and pelvic ganglia of diabetic animals at different times after streptozotocin treatment. Furthermore, we have studied their effect in vitro on human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells in the presence or absence of nNOS expression. METHODS: Serum AGEs were measured using fluorometry and ELISA. Accumulation of AGEs in the tissues was evaluated with immunohistochemistry. The viability, apoptosis and oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y cells were measured upon exposure to AGEs or high concentrations of glucose. RESULTS: AGEs increased gradually in the serum and tissues of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats; this process was not affected by delayed insulin treatment. In SH-SY5Y cells, AGEs, but not high glucose concentrations, increased the reactive oxygen species and caspase-3-dependent apoptosis in a synergistic fashion with endogenous nitric oxide (NO). Apoptosis was prevented by treatment with a NOS inhibitor, a pan-caspase inhibitor, a soluble receptor of AGEs or an anti-oxidant, but not an inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The synergistic actions of NO and AGEs account for the irreversible nitrergic degeneration in diabetes.

7485139|t|Effects of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor 1 on renal handling of phosphorus, calcium, and sodium in normal humans.
7485139|a|The effects of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) on renal handling of phosphorus, calcium, and sodium were evaluated in eight healthy men while they lived in a clinical research center for slightly more than 5 days. Subjects received a continuous intravenous infusion throughout the study of 0.45% saline and 2.5% d-glucose at 50 mL/hr (group 1, four subjects) or 150 mL/hr (group 2, four subjects). Recombinant human IGF-1 (rhIGF-1), 60 micrograms/kg body weight, was injected subcutaneously three times daily for 10 doses from day 2 until the beginning of day 5. After commencing the rhIGF-1 injections, there was a marked decrease in the fractional excretion of phosphorus in both groups that was sustained throughout the study. Urine phosphorus excretion also decreased significantly on days 2 to 5 in group 1 and on day 2 in group 2. In group 1, the fractional excretion of calcium decreased on day 2; urine calcium did not change. The fractional excretion of sodium decreased on days 2 and 4; urine sodium decreased significantly only on day 2. In group 2, the fractional and absolute urine excretion of calcium did not change. Fractional sodium excretion was not altered, and urine sodium increased only on day 5. The average serum phosphorus, calcium, and sodium did not change from baseline in groups 1 or 2. The pattern of the circadian rhythms for serum concentrations, urine excretion, and fractional excretion of phosphorus and calcium did not appear to be affected by the rhIGF-1 injections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

10393220|t|Lipolysis-induced iron release from diferric transferrin: Possible role of lipoprotein lipase in LDL oxidation.
10393220|a|Conditions leading to oxidation of LDL in vivo are still unknown. While the occurrence of oxidized lipoproteins and catalytic free iron in advanced atherosclerotic lesions has been demonstrated, the origin of both is unclear. In vivo, iron metabolism is tightly regulated by iron-binding proteins that ensure that virtually no free iron exists. We examined whether physiological events such as lipolysis might reduce pH, facilitate iron release from transferrin (Tf), and promote low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation. Lipolysis is brought about by lipoprotein lipase (LpL), a triglyceride hydrolase present on endothelial cell surfaces and in atherosclerotic lesions. LpL hydrolysis of Intralipid lowered pH from 7.40 to 7.00 in 10% human serum and from 7.40 to 6.88 in phosphate-buffered saline. Similar decreases in pH were also observed when very low density lipoproteins were hydrolyzed by LpL. Lipolysis was accompanied by a 2-fold increase in the release of 59Fe from Tf. Tf binding to subendothelial matrix (SEM), a site of key events in atherosclerosis, increased 2-fold as the pH decreased from 7.40 to 6.00. More free iron also bound to SEM as the pH decreased below 7.40. We next tested whether a reduction in pH promotes LDL oxidation. More oxidation products were found in LDL incubated at low pH for 24 h in 10% human serum. Malonaldehyde contents (nmol/mg protein), measured as TBARS, were 7.11 +/- 0.34 at pH 7.40, 7.65 +/- 0.49 at pH 7.00, 9.00 +/- 1.18 at pH 6.50, and 11. 54 +/- 0.63 at pH 6.00. Based on these results, we hypothesize that lipolysis-induced acidic conditions enhance iron release from Tf and increase formation of oxidized LDL.

1660229|t|Pentoxifylline reduces injury to isolated lungs perfused with human neutrophils.
1660229|a|Neutrophils and neutrophil-derived oxidants have been implicated in the development of acute lung injury such as that seen in the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and in animal models of lung injury, including the isolated perfused lung. Both neutrophil-derived oxidant production and retention of neutrophils in the lung are required for injury in this model. Pentoxifylline can reduce lung injury from sepsis in the guinea pig and endotoxin-induced neutrophil sequestration and lung injury in the dog. It is also known to increase neutrophil deformability, which may affect retention in the pulmonary microvasculature. We evaluated neutrophil oxidant production, retention in isolated lungs, and neutrophil-mediated acute lung injury after phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) in the presence of pentoxifylline. Pentoxifylline (2 mM) significantly reduced superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide production in vitro from PMA-stimulated neutrophils when pentoxifylline was directly added to the incubation mixtures, but not when neutrophils were preincubated with the agent. Pentoxifylline did not reduce retention of neutrophils in isolated lungs as determined by infusion of 111In-labeled neutrophils and gamma counting. Pentoxifylline prevented increases in total lung weight, lung-to-body-weight ratio, and perfusate thromboxane concentrations when it was present in perfusate buffer, whether or not neutrophils were preincubated in pentoxifylline prior to infusion into the lung. Pentoxifylline did not reduce injury to lungs perfused with glucose and glucose oxidase. We conclude that pentoxifylline reduces neutrophil oxidant production and neutrophil-dependent lung injury.

9633613|t|Osmolyte strategy in human monocytes and macrophages: involvement of p38MAPK in hyperosmotic induction of betaine and myoinositol transporters.
9633613|a|Betaine and myoinositol are compatible organic osmolytes which are specifically accumulated by cells exposed to hyperosmotic medium. A role for compatible organic osmolytes in the regulation of immune function for rat liver macrophages has been described recently. This report describes an osmolyte strategy in human peripheral blood monocytes and human peripheral blood-derived macrophages. Hyperosmotic (405 mOsm) exposure of monocytes and macrophages led to an upregulation of betaine/gamma-amino-n-butyric acid (GABA) transporter BGT-1 and sodium-dependent myoinositol transporter SMIT in mRNA levels within 6 to 12 h. Induction of BGT-1 and SMIT mRNA occurred regardless of whether hyperosmolarity was induced by addition of NaCl (50 mM) or raffinose (100 mM). Betaine (5 mM) inhibited upregulation of BGT-1 as well as SMIT mRNA. After hyperosmotic (405 mOsm) exposure uptake of betaine and myoinositol was increased up to 10-fold compared to normoosmotic conditions. Hypoosmotic exposure led to a rapid efflux of betaine and myoinositol. Treatment of cells with the pyridinyl imidazole SB 203580 (10 microM), a specific inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, inhibited the hyperosmolarity-induced increase in BGT-1 and SMIT mRNA as well as betaine and myoinositol uptake by 45-70%. The data show that human peripheral blood monocytes and human peripheral blood-derived macrophages use betaine and myoinositol are compatible organic osmolytes when exposed to osmotic stress and that p38MAPK is involved in hyperosmolarity-induced upregulation of osmolyte transporters BGT-1 and SMIT.

20563653|t|Protective roles and Pap1-dependent regulation of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe spy1 gene under nitrosative and nutritional stresses.
20563653|a|This work aimed to assess novel protective roles and regulation of Spy1, a histidine-containing phosphotransfer (HPt) protein, in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The structural gene encoding Spy1 was cloned into the shuttle vector pRS316 to generate the recombinant plasmid pYFSpy1. The spy1(+) mRNA level was notably increased in S. pombe cells harboring the plasmid pYFSpy1. The S. pombe cells harboring pYFSpy1 exhibited higher survival than the vector control cells on the minimal media plates with nitric oxide (NO)-generating sodium nitroprusside (SNP) or without nitrogen source. In the liquid minimal media, they also showed higher viability under nitrosative stress or nitrogen-starved condition. The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level appeared to be lower in the fission yeast cells harboring pYFSpy1 than in the control yeast cells. Overexpression of the spy1(+) gene showed scavenging effect on NO generated from SNP. Synthesis of β-galactosidase from the spy1(+)-lacZ fusion gene was significantly enhanced by SNP and nitrogen starvation in the Pap1-positive but not in the Pap1-negative cells. The spy1(+) mRNA level in S. pombe was also elevated by SNP and nitrogen starvation in the Pap1-positive but not in the Pap1-negative cells. In summary, Spy1 plays protective roles against nitrosative and nutritional stress in the fission yeast and is transcriptionally up-regulated by nitrosative and nutritional stresses in a Pap1-dependent manner.

The contraction elicited consisted of two phases, one rapid and one slowly developing stable phase; both were affected by the two calcium entry blockers flunarizine and nimodipine but at significantly different concentrations. In calcium-free medium 124 mM potassium resulted in a weak contraction. Addition of calcium caused a concentration-dependent contraction that was attenuated by the calcium entry blockers at concentrations comparable to those inhibiting the second phase. The results suggested that in human temporal arteries flunarizine and nimodipine act as calcium entry blockers; there was good correlation with the therapeutic plasma concentration for nimodipine but not for flunarizine.

8981022|t|Tyrosinase may protect human melanocytes from the cytotoxic effects of the superoxide anion.
8981022|a|Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are potentially cytotoxic and several mechanisms have evolved to protect against their damaging effects. In melanocytes, tyrosinase may have such a rôle by utilising the superoxide anion (O2-) in the production of melanin. In the present study, we have examined the cytotoxic effects of O2- and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in human melanocytes both before and following the activation of tyrosinase. Xanthine oxidase (XO, 5-150 mU.ml-1) and glucose oxidase (GO, 0.1-20 mU.ml-1) were used to generate the O2- and H2O2 respectively, and the cytotoxic effects assessed by measuring cell survival using the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) assay. 3 h later, dose-related decreases in melanocyte survival were seen. Similar experiments with keratinocytes and fibroblasts showed that these cells were more resistant to the cytotoxic effects of O2- than were the melanocytes. The effect of increasing tyrosinase activity was examined by growing the melanocytes in the presence of an analogue of melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) Nle4DPhe7 alpha-MSH (10(-8) M), for 48 h. This increased tyrosinase activity, melanin content, the ability to trap O2- and the resistance of the melanocytes to the cytotoxic effects of this ROS, but failed to alter their susceptibility to the damaging effects of H2O2.Nle4DPhe7 alpha-MSH had no effect on the resistance of keratinocytes and fibroblasts to either O2- or H2O2. After 3 h, XO, as opposed to GO, also increased the melanin content of human melanocytes; this effect was not accompanied by an increase in tyrosinase activity. The present results suggest that tyrosinase may utilise O2- to produce melanin and that this process may protect melanocytes from the potentially damaging effects of this ROS.

9792787|t|The role of histone acetylation in the allelic expression of the imprinted human insulin-like growth factor II gene.
9792787|a|Reversible histone acetylation plays a central role in X chromosome inactivation. Histones are hypoacetylated on the heavily methylated inactive X chromosome and are hyperacetylated in the unmethylated "CpG islands" in animal genomes. We have investigated whether histone acetylation is involved in the regulation of the allelic expression of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF2), a maternally imprinted gene. HSK09, a human fibroblast cell line, retained normal monoallelic expression of IGF2 in culture. When these cells were treated with histone deacetylase inhibitors, sodium butyrate or trichostatin A, biallelic expression of IGF2 was observed from all of the promoters that are expressed. These results suggest that, in addition to DNA methylation, differential histone acetylation of two parental alleles may be another potential mechanism by which the imprinting of IGF2 is regulated, probably through changes in the local chromatin structure of the imprinted locus on chromosome 11p15.

25584429|t|Triggering apoptotic death of human epidermal keratinocytes by malic Acid: involvement of endoplasmic reticulum stress- and mitochondria-dependent signaling pathways.
25584429|a|Malic acid (MA) has been commonly used in cosmetic products, but the safety reports in skin are sparse. To investigate the biological effects of MA in human skin keratinocytes, we investigated the potential cytotoxicity and apoptotic effects of MA in human keratinocyte cell lines (HaCaT). The data showed that MA induced apoptosis based on the observations of DAPI staining, DNA fragmentation, and sub-G1 phase in HaCaT cells and normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs). Flow cytometric assays also showed that MA increased the production of mitochondrial superoxide (mito-SOX) but decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential. Analysis of bioenergetics function with the XF 24 analyzer Seahorse extracellular flux analyzer demonstrated that oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was significantly decreased whereas extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) was increased in MA-treated keratinocytes. The occurrence of apoptosis was proved by the increased expressions of FasL, Fas, Bax, Bid, caspases-3, -8, -9, cytochrome c, and the declined expressions of Bcl-2, PARP. MA also induced endoplasmic reticulum stress associated protein expression such as GRP78, GADD153, and ATF6α. We demonstrated that MA had anti-proliferative effect in HaCaT cell through the inhibition of cell cycle progression at G0/G1, and the induction of programmed cell death through endoplasmic reticulum stress- and mitochondria-dependent pathways.

11562285|t|Vitamin D analogs: mechanism of action and therapeutic applications.
11562285|a|The physiological VDR ligand, 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, acts upon a wide variety of tissues and cells, both related to and unrelated to calcium and phosphate homeostasis. The noncalcemic actions of natural and synthetic VDR ligands are exemplified by their potent anti-proliferative, prodifferentiative and immunomodulatory activities. As a result, a VDR ligand is an approved drug for the topical treatment of psoriasis. A plethora of actions of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in various systems have suggested wide clinical applications of VDR ligands in such diverse disease states as inflammation (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis), dermatological indications (psoriasis, photoaging and skin rejuvenation), osteoporosis, cancers (breast, prostate, colon, leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome) and autoimmune diseases (multiple sclerosis, type I diabetes and systemic lupus erythematosus). VDR ligands have shown therapeutic potential in limited human clinical trials as well as in animal models of these diseases. Some of the VDR ligands have shown not only potent preventive but also therapeutic anabolic activities in animal models of osteoporosis. However, the use of VDR in above mentioned indications as well as in oral therapy for psoriasis and even topical therapy for severe psoriasis is hampered by its associated toxicity, namely hypercalcemia. New VDR ligands have been synthesized which exhibit greater specificity by retaining desirable properties, but with reduced calcemic potential. The discovery of novel vitamin D3 analogs along with an increased understanding of the biological functions and mechanisms of action of VDR are likely to result in improved treatments for responsive indications.

2543633|t|Oxidant stress in Neisseria gonorrhoeae: adaptation and effects on L-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase activity.
2543633|a|Neisseria gonorrhoeae, an obligate human pathogen, is subjected to oxidant stress when attacked by O2 reduction products formed by neutrophils. In this study, exposure of gonococci to sublethal concentrations of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (and related O-centered radicals) resulted in phenotypic resistance to oxidant stress. Adaptation required new protein formation but was not related to increases in superoxide dismutase or catalase. We have previously demonstrated that gonococci use phagocyte-derived L-(+)-lactate. Oxidant stress of greater magnitude than that required for adaptation led to a generalized increase in bacterial metabolism, particularly in L-(+)- and D-(-)-lactate utilization and lactate dehydrogenase activity. Increased lactate utilization required new protein synthesis. These results suggest the possibility that lactate metabolism is of importance to N. gonorrhoeae subjected to oxidant stress. Use of lct mutant organisms unable to use L-(+)-lactate should allow examination of this hypothesis.

21496279|t|Piper sarmentosum inhibits ICAM-1 and Nox4 gene expression in oxidative stress-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells.
21496279|a|BACKGROUND: Aqueous extract of Piper sarmentosum (AEPS) is known to possess antioxidant and anti-atherosclerotic activities but the mechanism responsible for it remains unclear. In early part of atherosclerosis, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) induces the expression of cellular adhesion molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and E-selectin. NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) is the predominant source of superoxide in the endothelial cells whereas superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) are the antioxidant enzymes responsible for inactivating reactive oxygen species. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of AEPS on the gene expression of NF-κB, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, E-selectin, Nox4, SOD1, CAT and GPx in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). METHODS: HUVECs were divided into four groups:- control; treatment with 180 μM hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂); treatment with 150 μg/mL AEPS and concomitant treatment with AEPS and H₂O₂ for 24 hours. Total RNA was extracted from all the groups of HUVEC using TRI reagent. Subsequently, qPCR was carried out to determine the mRNA expression of NF-κB, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, E-selectin, Nox4, SOD1, CAT and GPx. The specificity of the reactions was verified using melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: When stimulated with H₂O₂, HUVECs expressed higher level of ICAM-1 (1.3-fold) and Nox4 (1.2-fold) mRNA expression. However, AEPS treatment led to a reduction in the mRNA expression of ICAM-1 (p < 0.01) and Nox4 (p < 0.05) in the H₂O₂-induced HUVECs. AEPS also upregulated the mRNA expression of SOD1 (p < 0.05), CAT (p < 0.01) and GPx (p < 0.05) in oxidative stress-induced HUVECs. There was no significant change in the mRNA expression of VCAM-1 and E-selectin. CONCLUSION: The expressional suppression of ICAM-1 and Nox4 and induction of antioxidant enzymes might be an important component of the vascular protective effect of AEPS.

26045665|t|Nanoalumina induces apoptosis by impairing antioxidant enzyme systems in human hepatocarcinoma cells.
26045665|a|Alumina nanoparticles (Al2O3NPs) are gradually used in various areas, including nanomedicine, biosensors, and electronics. The current study aimed to explore the DNA damage and cytotoxicity due to Al2O3NPs on human hepatocarcinoma cells (HepG2). The MTT and neutral red uptake assays showed that Al2O3NPs induce significant cell death in a dose- and time-dependent manner. However, Al2O3NPs induced significant intracellular reactive oxygen species production and elevated lipid peroxidation and superoxide dismutase levels in the HepG2 cells. Al2O3NPs also induced significant decrease in reduced glutathione levels and increase caspase-3 activity in HepG2 cells. DNA fragmentation analysis using the alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis showed that Al2O3NPs cause genotoxicity in dose- and time-dependent manner. However, they induce reactive oxygen species production and oxidative stress, leading to oxidative DNA damage, a probable mechanism of genotoxicity. This study warrants more careful assessment of Al2O3NPs before their industrial application.

673098|t|Evidence of increased proximal sodium and water reabsorption in experimental glomerulonephritis. Role of a natriuretic factor of renal origin.
673098|a|In previous work, we have demonstrated that rats with experimental glomerulonephritis (GN) were unable to increase fractional and absolute sodium excretion after saline loading. This inability appears to be related to the disappearance of a natriuretic material that we have shown to be of renal origin. Similar results were obtained in human GN. In order to identify the nephronic site of the enhanced tubular sodium reabsorption, two techniques were used: (1) study of TmG in normal and glomerulonephritic rats during a progressive saline loading, and (2) micropuncture studies of sodium and water reabsorption. The results clearly demonstrate that: (1) in GN rats, TmG is increased in proportion with Na reabsorption; (2) TmG decreases, of the same magnitude, in GN and normal rats during progressive saline loading; (3) one site of the increased sodium and water reabsorption is proximal as evidenced by glucose titration curve and micropuncture studies, and (4) there is a disruption of glomerulotubular balance in GN rats. Moreover, the parallel behavior of TmG and proximal sodium reabsorption strongly suggests that the part of sodium transport presumbably linked to glucose transport is selectively involved. These results also suggest that the observed disorders are due to the disappearance of a renal natriuretic factor, the site of action of which being presumably proximal.

25759595|t|Effect of pulsed electromagnetic field treatment on programmed resolution of inflammation pathway markers in human cells in culture.
25759595|a|Inflammation is a complex process involving distinct but overlapping biochemical and molecular events that are highly regulated. Pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) therapy is increasingly used to treat pain and edema associated with inflammation following surgery involving soft tissue. However, the molecular and cellular effects of PEMF therapy on pathways involved in the resolution of inflammation are poorly understood. Using cell culture lines relevant to trauma-induced inflammation of the skin (human dermal fibroblasts, human epidermal keratinocytes, and human mononuclear cells), we investigated the effect of PEMF on gene expression involved in the acute and resolution phases of inflammation. We found that PEMF treatment was followed by changes in the relative amount of messenger (m)RNAs encoding enzymes involved in heme catabolism and removal of reactive oxygen species, including an increase in heme oxygenase 1 and superoxide dismutase 3 mRNAs, in all cell types examined 2 hours after PEMF treatment. A relative increase in mRNAs encoding enzymes involved in lipid mediator biosynthesis was also observed, including an increase in arachidonate 12- and 15-lipoxygenase mRNAs in dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes, respectively. The relative amount of both of these lipoxygenase mRNAs was elevated in mononuclear cells following PEMF treatment relative to nontreated cells. PEMF treatment was also followed by changes in the mRNA levels of several cytokines. A decrease in the relative amount of interleukin 1 beta mRNA was observed in mononuclear cells, similar to that previously reported for epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts. Based on our results, we propose a model in which PEMF therapy may promote chronic inflammation resolution by mediating gene expression changes important for inhibiting and resolving inflammation.

28832634|t|Expression and potential roles of sodium-potassium ATPase and E-cadherin in human gastric adenocarcinoma.
28832634|a|BACKGROUND: Gastric adenocarcinoma originates from an abnormal epithelium. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of sodium-potassium ATPase (NKA), a transmembrane protein located in the epithelium for Na+ and K+ transportation, and E-cadherin, which are both crucial for the epithelium and adherens junction, as potential gastric cancer biomarkers. METHODS: 45 patients diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma were recruited. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were conducted to for localization of NKA α1-, β1-isoform, and E-cadherin. NKA enzyme activity was determined by NADH-linked methods and immunoblotting of NKA α1-, β1-isoform, and E-cadherin were performed to evaluate protein expression. RESULTS: Immunostaining revealed that NKA was co-localized with E-cadherin in the glands of the gastric epithelium. Both NKA activity and α1-isoform protein expression were reduced in the study group (P < 0.05), indicating impaired NKA functions. In the adherens junctions, the NKA β1-isoform and E-cadherin were significantly reduced in the study groups (P < 0.05), indicating the adhesion force between cells may have been weakened. CONCLUSIONS: A significant decrease in NKA function (protein and activity) and E-cadherin in tumor lesions appear promising biomarker for gastric adenocarcinoma. Therefore, developing screening methods for detecting NKA function may be beneficial for the early diagnosis of gastric cancer. In our knowledge, this study was the first to investigate the NKA and E-cadherin expression in the relation of gastric adenocarcinoma in human patients.

18553478|t|Control strategies of continuous bioprocesses based on biological activities.
18553478|a|Based on the material balance principle applied to microbial reactions in continuous bioprocesses, the concept of reaction rate control has been developed theoretically. This concept provides a more direct way of controlling biological activities than the control of physical or chemical parameters in practice today. From an analysis of dynamic and steady-state experiments, two control systems for carbon dioxide production rate control during the continuous culture of baker's yeast have been designed and evaluated experimentally. In these control methods, intracellular NADH concentration is used as an immediate indication of the onset of glucose repression. A more sophisticated master controller based on the respiratory quotient can be combined with these control methods. The resulting control system provides a means to indirectly optimize biomass production while preventing ethanol formation in the continuous culture of baker's yeast.

28275387|t| Gene Mutation and Characterized by Postprandial Heavy Glycosuria Without Salt Wasting.
28275387|a| mutation via gene sequencing, and compared the postprandial urinary glucose and sodium excretion. A 26-year-old man sometimes experienced glycosuria on routine screening; however, other laboratory findings were normal. His fasting and postprandial urinary glucose excretion levels were 295mg/dL and 2,170mg/dL, respectively. The fasting and postprandial urinary sodium excretion levels were 200mEq/L and 89mEq/L, respectively. In patients with FRG, excessive diuresis might be prevented by a compensatory mechanism that reduces postprandial sodium excretion.

16155939|t|Enhancement of apoptosis by nitric oxide released from alpha-phenyl-tert-butyl nitrone under hyperthermic conditions.
16155939|a|The aim of this study was to examine whether a neuroprotector, PBN (alpha-phenyl-tert-butyl nitrone), enhances apoptosis induced by hyperthermia, which generates superoxide (O2-) intracellularly, since the release of nitric oxide (NO) from PBN under oxidative stress has been reported. When human myelomonocytic lymphoma U937 cells were treated with hyperthermia (44 degrees C, 10 min) and PBN, an increase in the concentration of nitrite in the culture medium, and a decrease in the hyperthermia-induced production of O2- was observed. Imaging using a fluorescence dye for intracellular NO, diaminofluorescein-2 diacetate (DAF-2 DA), revealed the formation of NO in the apoptotic cells treated with hyperthermia and PBN combined. Apoptotic endpoints were significantly enhanced by the combined treatment: a decrease in mitochondrial trans-membrane potential, cleavage of Bid, release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspase-8 and -3. An increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), externalization of Fas, and decrease in Hsp70 and phosphorylated HSF1 were observed following the combined treatment. Furthermore, scavengers of NO an d ONOO- significantly inhibited the enhancement of apoptosis, the externalization of Fas and the increase in [Ca2+]i. These results suggest that, (1) NO is released from PBN by hyperthermia, and subsequently reacts with O2- to form ONOO-, (2) NO and ONOO- are involved in the enhancement of apoptosis through Fas-mitochondria-caspase and [Ca2+]i-dependent pathways, and (3) a decrease in Hsp70 and phosphorylated HSF1 also contributed to the enhancement of apoptosis.

24190136|t|Relationships between trehalose metabolism and maltose utilization in Saccharomyces cerevisiae : II. Effect of Constitutive MAL Genes.
24190136|a|A pattern of active accumulation of trehalose during growth on glucose medium, TAC(+) phenotype, is controlled by a polymeric series of maltose fermentation (MAL) genes. An essential requirement for expression of the TAC(+) phenotype is that the MAL gene be in the constitutive state, MAL (c). Mutation of a constitutive MAL allele to a maltose- inducible or nonfermenting (mal) state, alters the pattern of trehalose metabolism so that little or no trehalose accumulation occurs during growth on glucose medium. The TAC(+) phenotype is obtained in MAL (c) strains whether or not α-glucosidase formation is sensitive or resistant to carbon catabolite repression. However, trehalose accumulation is sensitive to glucose levels even in MAL (c) strains in which α-glucosidase formation is insensitive to catabolite repression. The effects of constitutive MAL genes on trehalose accumulation cannot be accounted for by an increase in trehalose-6 phosphate synthase or a decrease in trehalase as determined in vitro. A mechanism is proposed in which the gene-product of a MAL gene serves as a common positive regulator for expression of four genes coding respectively for maltose permease, maltase, α-methylglucosidase and a component of the trehalose accumulation system.

23826370|t|Water Quality Conditions Associated with Cattle Grazing and Recreation on National Forest Lands.
23826370|a|There is substantial concern that microbial and nutrient pollution by cattle on public lands degrades water quality, threatening human and ecological health. Given the importance of clean water on multiple-use landscapes, additional research is required to document and examine potential water quality issues across common resource use activities. During the 2011 grazing-recreation season, we conducted a cross sectional survey of water quality conditions associated with cattle grazing and/or recreation on 12 public lands grazing allotments in California. Our specific study objectives were to 1) quantify fecal indicator bacteria (FIB; fecal coliform and E. coli), total nitrogen, nitrate, ammonium, total phosphorus, and soluble-reactive phosphorus concentrations in surface waters; 2) compare results to a) water quality regulatory benchmarks, b) recommended maximum nutrient concentrations, and c) estimates of nutrient background concentrations; and 3) examine relationships between water quality, environmental conditions, cattle grazing, and recreation. Nutrient concentrations observed throughout the grazing-recreation season were at least one order of magnitude below levels of ecological concern, and were similar to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) estimates for background water quality conditions in the region. The relative percentage of FIB regulatory benchmark exceedances widely varied under individual regional and national water quality standards. Relative to USEPA's national E. coli FIB benchmarks-the most contemporary and relevant standards for this study-over 90% of the 743 samples collected were below recommended criteria values. FIB concentrations were significantly greater when stream flow was low or stagnant, water was turbid, and when cattle were actively observed at sampling. Recreation sites had the lowest mean FIB, total nitrogen, and soluble-reactive phosphorus concentrations, and there were no significant differences in FIB and nutrient concentrations between key grazing areas and non-concentrated use areas. Our results suggest cattle grazing, recreation, and provisioning of clean water can be compatible goals across these national forest lands.

22573773|t|Respiratory properties of blood in the harbor porpoise, Phocoena phocoena.
22573773|a|Harbor porpoises are active divers that exchange O(2) and CO(2) with the environment during a fast single breath upon surfacing. We investigated blood O(2)-transporting properties, buffer characteristics, Cl(-) transport via the erythrocyte anion exchanger (AE1), circulating nitric oxide metabolites and hemoglobin nitrite reduction in harbor porpoises with the aim to evaluate traits that are adaptive for diving behavior. Blood O(2) affinity was higher in harbor porpoises than in similar sized terrestrial mammals, as supported by our parallel recordings of O(2) equilibria in sheep and pig blood. Further, O(2) affinity tended to increase with increasing body mass. A high O(2) affinity favors O(2) extraction from the lungs, but a normal Bohr effect (ΔlogP(50)/ΔpH=-0.46) gradually lowers O(2) affinity during dives (where CO(2) accumulates) to assist O(2) off-loading to perfused tissues. The true plasma non-bicarbonate buffer value was moderately higher than in terrestrial mammals and increased upon deoxygenation. Plasma bicarbonate was also relatively high, contributing to increase the overall buffer capacity. The apparent Cl(-) permeability of harbor porpoise erythrocytes was similar to the human value at 37°C, showing absence of a comparative increase in the velocity of erythrocyte HCO(-)(3)/Cl(-) exchange to aid CO(2) excretion. The Q(10) for AE1-mediated Cl(-) transport in harbor porpoises was lower than in humans and seemed to match the Q(10) for metabolism (Q(10)≈2). Plasma nitrite, plasma nitrate and hemoglobin-mediated nitrite reduction were elevated compared with mammalian standards, suggesting that increased nitric oxide bioavailability and nitrite-derived nitric oxide could play important roles in diving physiology.

20876213|t|The coordinated increased expression of biliverdin reductase and heme oxygenase-2 promotes cardiomyocyte survival: a reductase-based peptide counters β-adrenergic receptor ligand-mediated cardiac dysfunction.
20876213|a|HO-2 oxidizes heme to CO and biliverdin; the latter is reduced to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase (BVR). In addition, HO-2 is a redox-sensitive K/Ca(2)-associated protein, and BVR is an S/T/Y kinase. The two enzymes are components of cellular defense mechanisms. This is the first reporting of regulation of HO-2 by BVR and that their coordinated increase in isolated myocytes and intact heart protects against cardiotoxicity of β-adrenergic receptor activation by isoproterenol (ISO). The induction of BVR mRNA, protein, and activity and HO-2 protein was maintained for ≥ 96 h; increase in HO-1 was modest and transient. In isolated cardiomyocytes, experiments with cycloheximide, proteasome inhibitor MG-132, and siBVR suggested BVR-mediated stabilization of HO-2. In both models, activation of BVR offered protection against the ligand's stimulation of apoptosis. Two human BVR-based peptides known to inhibit and activate the reductase, KKRILHC(281) and KYCCSRK(296), respectively, were tested in the intact heart. Perfusion of the heart with the inhibitory peptide blocked ISO-mediated BVR activation and augmented apoptosis; conversely, perfusion with the activating peptide inhibited apoptosis. At the functional level, peptide-mediated inhibition of BVR was accompanied by dysfunction of the left ventricle and decrease in HO-2 protein levels. Perfusion of the organ with the activating peptide preserved the left ventricular contractile function and was accompanied by increased levels of HO-2 protein. Finding that BVR and HO-2 levels, myocyte apoptosis, and contractile function of the heart can be modulated by small human BVR-based peptides offers a promising therapeutic approach for treatment of cardiac dysfunctions.

18204136|a|Cigarette smoking is linked to various human disorders. Active and passive smokers suffer from inflammatory diseases of lungs and airways. Smoking-dependent airway inflammation is related to the cytotoxic effects of cigarette smoke (CS) and chronic recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages. NF-kappaB is a key inflammatory, redox-sensitive transcription factor. Its role in CS-induced airway inflammation is unclear. This study investigated CS-induced NF-kappaB activation in human lymphocytes and the possible involvement of oxidative insult in this activation. A method for accurate and reproducible exposure of lymphocytes to CS was developed. The intensity of CS exposure was linearly correlated with nitrite concentration originating from reactive oxygen species in CS. Mild, but not high exposure to CS, induced NF-kappaB in lymphocytes through the increase in oxidative stress and the reduction in the intracellular glutathione levels. These findings may have implications to active as well as to passive smokers, suffering from inflammatory diseases of lungs and airways.

12200438|t|Cessation of growth to prevent cell death due to inhibition of phosphatidylcholine synthesis is impaired at 37 degrees C in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
12200438|a|Phosphatidylcholine is the most abundant phospholipid in eukaryotic cells, comprising 50% of total cellular phospholipid, and thus plays a major role in cellular and organellar biogenesis. In this study, we have used both nutritional deprivation as well as a conditional temperature sensitive allele of PCT1 (CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase) coupled with an inactivated phosphatidylethanolamine methylation pathway to determine how cells respond to inactivation of phosphatidylcholine synthesis. Metabolic studies determined that phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis decreased to negligible levels within 1 h upon shift to the nonpermissive temperature for the temperature-sensitive PCT1 allele. Phosphatidylcholine mass decreased to negligible levels upon removal of choline from the medium or growth at the nonpermissive temperature, with the levels of the other major phospholipids increasing slightly. Cell growth rate visibly slowed upon cessation of phosphatidylcholine synthesis. Cells remained viable for 7-8 h after phosphatidylcholine synthesis was prevented; however, at time points beyond 8 h, viability was significantly reduced but only if the cells had been previously grown at 37 degrees C and not 25 degrees C. The inhibition of phosphatidylcholine synthesis at 37 degrees C did not alter Golgi-derived vesicle transport to the vacuole as monitored by carboxypeptidase Y processing or to the plasma membrane as determined by invertase secretion. Immunofluorescence microscopy localized Pct1p to the nucleus and nuclear membrane. Pct1p activity is regulated by Sec14p, a cytoplasm/Golgi localized phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylinositol binding protein that regulates Golgi-derived vesicle transport partially through its ligand-dependent regulation of PCT1 derived enzyme activity. Our nuclear localization of Pct1p indicates that the regulation of Pct1p by Sec14p is indirect.

26073127|t|Targeting mitochondrial reactive oxygen species to modulate hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension.
26073127|a|Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is characterized by increased pulmonary vascular remodeling, resistance, and pressures. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to PH-associated vascular dysfunction. NADPH oxidases (Nox) and mitochondria are major sources of superoxide (O(2)(•-)) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) in pulmonary vascular cells. Hypoxia, a common stimulus of PH, increases Nox expression and mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) production. The interactions between these two sources of ROS generation continue to be defined. We hypothesized that mitochondria-derived O(2)(•-) (mtO(2)(•-)) and H(2)O(2) (mtH(2)O(2)) increase Nox expression to promote PH pathogenesis and that mitochondria-targeted antioxidants can reduce mtROS, Nox expression, and hypoxia-induced PH. Exposure of human pulmonary artery endothelial cells to hypoxia for 72 h increased mtO(2)(•-) and mtH(2)O(2). To assess the contribution of mtO(2)(•-) and mtH(2)O(2) to hypoxia-induced PH, mice that overexpress superoxide dismutase 2 (Tg(hSOD2)) or mitochondria-targeted catalase (MCAT) were exposed to normoxia (21% O(2)) or hypoxia (10% O(2)) for three weeks. Compared with hypoxic control mice, MCAT mice developed smaller hypoxia-induced increases in RVSP, α-SMA staining, extracellular H(2)O(2) (Amplex Red), Nox2 and Nox4 (qRT-PCR and Western blot), or cyclinD1 and PCNA (Western blot). In contrast, Tg(hSOD2) mice experienced exacerbated responses to hypoxia. These studies demonstrate that hypoxia increases mtO(2)(•-) and mtH(2)O(2). Targeting mtH(2)O(2) attenuates PH pathogenesis, whereas targeting mtO(2)(•-) exacerbates PH. These differences in PH pathogenesis were mirrored by RVSP, vessel muscularization, levels of Nox2 and Nox4, proliferation, and H(2)O(2) release. These studies suggest that targeted reductions in mtH(2)O(2) generation may be particularly effective in preventing hypoxia-induced PH.

12486123|t|Activation of heterotrimeric G proteins by a high energy phosphate transfer via nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) B and Gbeta subunits. Complex formation of NDPK B with Gbeta gamma dimers and phosphorylation of His-266 IN Gbeta.
12486123|a|G protein betagamma dimers can be phosphorylated in membranes from various tissues by GTP at a histidine residue in the beta subunit. The phosphate is high energetic and can be transferred onto GDP leading to formation of GTP. Purified Gbetagamma dimers do not display autophosphorylation, indicating the involvement of a separate protein kinase. We therefore enriched the Gbeta-phosphorylating activity present in preparations of the retinal G protein transducin and in partially purified G(i/o) proteins from bovine brain. Immunoblots, autophosphorylation, and enzymatic activity measurements demonstrated enriched nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) B in both preparations, together with residual Gbetagamma dimers. In the retinal NDPK B-enriched fractions, a Gbeta-specific antiserum co-precipitated phosphorylated NDPK B, and an antiserum against the human NDPK co-precipitated phosphorylated Gbetagamma. In addition, the NDPK-containing fractions from bovine brain reconstituted the phosphorylation of purified Gbetagamma. For identification of the phosphorylated histidine residue, bovine brain Gbetagamma and G(t)betagamma were thiophosphorylated with guanosine 5'-O-(3-[(35)S]thio)triphosphate, followed by digestion with endoproteinase Glu-C and trypsin, separation of the resulting peptides by gel electrophoresis and high pressure liquid chromatography, respectively, and sequencing of the radioactive peptides. The sequence information produced by both methods identified specific labeled fragments of bovine Gbeta(1) that overlapped in the heptapeptide, Leu-Met-Thr-Tyr-Ser-His-Asp (amino acids 261-267). We conclude that NDPK B forms complexes with Gbetagamma dimers and contributes to G protein activation by increasing the high energetic phosphate transfer onto GDP via intermediately phosphorylated His-266 in Gbeta(1) subunits.

25929585|t|A review and discussion of platelet nitric oxide and nitric oxide synthase: do blood platelets produce nitric oxide from L-arginine or nitrite?
25929585|a|The NO/sGC/cGMP/PKG system is one of the most powerful mechanisms responsible for platelet inhibition. In numerous publications, expression of functional NO synthase (NOS) in human and mouse platelets has been reported. Constitutive and inducible NOS isoforms convert L-arginine to NO and L-citrulline. The importance of this pathway in platelets and in endothelial cells for the regulation of platelet function is discussed since decades. However, there are serious doubts in the literature concerning both expression and functionality of NOS in platelets. In this review, we aim to present and critically evaluate recent data concerning NOS expression and function in platelets, and to especially emphasise potential pitfalls of detection of NOS proteins and measurement of NOS activity. Prevailing analytical problems are probably the main sources of contradictory data on occurrence, activity and function of NOS in platelets. In this review we also address issues of how these problems can be resolved. NO donors including organic nitrites (RONO) and organic nitrate (RONO2) are inhibitors of platelet activation. Endogenous inorganic nitrite (NO2 (-)), the product of NO autoxidation, and exogenous inorganic nitrite are increasingly investigated as NO donors in the circulation. The role of platelets in the generation of NO from nitrite is also discussed.

17987632|t|Optimizing separation efficiency of 2-DE procedures for visualization of different superoxide dismutase forms in a cellular model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
17987632|a|Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD) have been associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species. In AD and PD patients, superoxide dismutase (SOD1) was also indicated as a major target of oxidative damage. In particular, in brain tissue of these patients, different SOD1 isoforms have been identified, although their functional role still remains to be elucidated. In the light of the possibility that different SOD1 entities could be expressed also in other neurodegenerative disorders, as a sort of unifying event with AD and PD, we have investigated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells with mutated SOD1 gene H46R as cellular model. 2-DE using a narrow-range IPG 4-7 strips in the first dimension and linear 15% SDS-PAGE in the second allowed to separate different SOD1 spots. MALDI-TOF MS and CapLC-MS/MS have been used for their complete identification. This is the first report in which the presence of SOD1 (iso) forms in a cellular model of ALS has been evidenced.

7833264|t|Plasma nitrate concentrations in neutropenic and non-neutropenic patients with suspected septicaemia.
7833264|a|Nitric oxide (NO) is an important physiological mediator of vascular tone and is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of septic shock. Plasma nitrate is the stable end product of NO oxidation and in part reflects endogenous NO production. We measured plasma nitrate levels in 47 episodes of suspected septicaemia in 43 in-patients (16 male and 27 female, age 15-63 years). Nitrate concentrations were significantly higher (P < 0.01) compared to healthy controls. Further analysis revealed that significantly elevated levels occurred only in the septic patients who had normal or elevated numbers of neutrophils in the peripheral blood and were hypotensive on presentation. Failure of plasma nitrate concentrations to rise significantly in patients with neutropenia suggests that this cell type may be important in the activation of the arginine-NO system in severe sepsis in man.

15665314|t|Association of fetal hormone levels with stem cell potential: evidence for early life roots of human cancer.
15665314|a|Intrauterine and perinatal factors have been linked to risk of childhood leukemia, testicular cancer, and breast cancer in the offspring. The pool of stem cells in target tissue has been suggested as a critical factor linking early life exposures to cancer. We examined the relation between intrauterine hormone levels and measurements of stem cell potential in umbilical cord blood. Cord blood donors were 40 women, ages >/=18 years, who delivered, from August 2002 to June 2003, a singleton birth after a gestation of at least 37 weeks. We assayed plasma concentrations of estradiol, unconjugated estriol, testosterone, progesterone, prolactin, sex hormone binding globulin, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), and IGF binding protein-3. For stem cell potential, we measured concentrations of CD34(+) and CD34(+)CD38(-) cells and granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (CFU-GM). We applied linear regression analysis and controlled for maternal and neonatal characteristics. We found strong positive associations between IGF-I and stem cell measures, 1 SD increase in IGF-I being associated with a 41% increase in CD34(+) (P = 0.008), a 109% increase in CD34(+)CD38(-) (P = 0.005), and a 94% increase in CFU-GM (P = 0.01). Similar associations were observed for IGF binding protein-3. Among steroid hormones, estriol and testosterone were significantly positively associated with CD34(+) and CFU-GM. These findings indicate that levels of growth factors and hormones are strongly associated with stem cell potential in human umbilical cord blood and point to a potential mechanism that may mediate the relationship between in utero exposure to hormones and cancer risk in the offspring.

9635374|t|Acetaldehyde inhibits chymotrypsin and serum anti-chymotrypsin activity.
9635374|a|BACKGROUND: Chymotrypsin (CT) and CT-like enzymes contribute to the dynamics of metabolism by their participation in digestion, peptide hormone generation and catabolism, fertilization of ova and inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, among other processes. The frequency of pancreatitis is observably higher in alcoholics, and pancreatic enzymes have been associated with localized vascular damage, thrombosis and pancreatic necrosis. METHODS: Since CT is a major pancreatic enzyme and may serve as a link between pancreatitis, coagulopathy, and alcoholism, the affect of acetaldehyde (AcH) the primary metabolite of ethanol, upon the enzyme and upon the influence of human serum thereon was studied. RESULTS: It was observed that CT activity upon glutaryl-L-phenylalanine-b-naphthylamide was inhibited to the extent of 23.7%, 52.5%, and 96.7% by 44.7, 89.4, and 447 mmol/L AcH in a fluorometric assay whereby the enzyme was dialyzed to remove excess AcH prior to assay. The p values were < 0.04. Aliquots of human serum (10 microL, 20 microL, 30 microL, 40 microL, 50 microL, and 100 microL) inhibited 40 micrograms of CT by 13%, 37.7%, 65.3%, 89.8%, and 92.8%, respectively (n = 6; p = < 0.05). The serum did not hydrolyze the fluorogenic substrate. On the other hand, AcH added to serum at 447, 224, 112, or 56 mmol/L resulted in 42.6%, 42.6%, 52.9%, and 60.3% inhibition of CT relative to a 69.1% inhibition of the enzyme by serum alone (n = 6; = p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These data show that AcH clearly decreases the antichymotryptic activity of serum (consisting of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, and alpha 2-macroglobulin). The incomplete inactivation of chymotrypsin by serum and partial inactivation of CT inhibitor(s) by AcH suggest the possibility that CT leaked into the circulation, (in alcoholic pancreatitis) may be available in blood to lower the clotting potential induced by thrombin-activated platelets, and that a greater amount of CT might be available in the blood of alcoholics, thereby contributing, in part, to the prolongation of clotting times.

2086319|t|Evaluation of the toxicity of indomethacin in a 4-week study, by oral route, in the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).
2086319|a|A subacute toxicity study of Indomethacin administered by oral route, was carried out in the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Groups of three males and three females received Indomethacin directly into the stomach by means of a catheter for a period of 4 weeks at the dose levels of 0, 2, 6, and 12 mg/kg body wt/day and then were euthanized for pathological evaluation. All marmosets given 12 mg/kg/day and one marmoset given 6 mg/kg/day died during the dosing period (within 20 days). At 12 mg/kg/day, Indomethacin induced severe gastrointestinal toxicity (hemorrhage, ulcers, and necrosis with peritonitis), while at the dosages of 6 and 2 mg/kg/day some moderate to slight dose-related functional and morphological renal alterations (increase of serum urea, reduction of serum albumin, increase of serum potassium and/or chloride, and subacute inflammation) were observed. The fact that in many respects these alterations are similar to those observed in man is a further demonstration of the validity of the marmoset as an experimental model.

12684814|t|Immunohistochemical localization of sodium-potassium ATPase in human normal stomach and gastric adenocarcinomas.
12684814|a|We studied the expression pattern of Na, K-ATPase beta 1 subunit in human normal stomachs and in gastric adenocarcinomas by using anti-Na, K-ATPase beta 1 subunit-specific monoclonal antibody. Tissue samples were processed in formalin solution or in a cold acetic acid-ethanol solution, routinely processed, embedded in paraffin, and an immunoperoxidase method for Na, K-ATPase beta 1 subunit was performed. After antigen retrieval using a steamer in citrate buffer (pH 6.0), tissue sections initially fixed in cold acetic acid-ethanol showed intense immunoreactivity with the antibody at the lateral or basolateral cytoplasmic membrane of normal gastric epithelial cells, at the cytoplasmic membrane of gastric carcinoma cells according to the level of differentiation, and at the cytoplasmic membrane and in the cytoplasm of Schwann cells and neurons in the mesenteric plexus of the gastric wall. Acetic acid-ethanol and paraffin embedding is a useful method for the investigation of the immunohistochemical localization of Na, K-ATPase in normal and diseased tissues.

1104659|t|Is aromatization of testosterone to estradiol required for inhibition of luteinizing hormone secretion in men?
1104659|a|A variety of studies in man and animals demonstrate that testosterone (T) is aromatized to estradiol (E) in the hypothalamus and limbic system. These observations suggested the possibility that conversion to E is an absolute requirement for the biologic activity of T on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Since this hypothesis implies a common mechanism of action of these two steroids, the demonstration of divergent effects of T and E on luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion would exclude this possibility. To test this hypothesis, the actions of T and E on three separate aspects of LH release (mean LH, pulsatile LH secretion, and responsiveness to LH-releasing hormone [LH-RH]) were contrasted. T and E, infused at two times their respective production rates into normal men, reduced mean LH levels similarly during 6 h of steroid infusion and for 6 h thereafter. However, these steroids exerted different effects on pulsatile secretion. E reduced the amplitude of spontaneous LH pulse from pre- and postinfusion control levels of 75+/-14 and 68+/-5.6% (SEM) to 39+/-5.7%. In contrast, T increased pulse amplited to 96+/-14% and decreased pulse frequency from basal levels of 3.4+/-0.31 to 1.8+/-0.31 pulses/6h. The site of suppressive action was determined by administering 25 microgms of LH-RH to the same men during T and E infusions and during three additional control periods without steroid administration. LH-RH produced similar 170-190% increments in serum LH during the three control periods and during T infusion. In contrast, E markedly blunted (76+/-31%, p less than 0.005) the LH response to LH-RH. Under the conditions of acute steroid infusion at doses (utilized in these experiments) producing similar inhibition of mean LH, E but not T acted directly on the pituitary to diminish LH-RH responsiveness. As further support that androgens can act without conversion to estrogens, the effects of a nonaromatizable androgen, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), on mean LH levels were studied. DHT, infused at the same rate as T, suppressed mean LH to a similar but somewhat greater extent than T. Since T and E produced divergent effects on LH secretion and a nonaromatizable androgen, DHT, suppressed mean LH, aromatization is not a necessary prerequisite for the action of androgens on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.

9294772|t|Chemical stability of polyether urethanes versus polycarbonate urethanes.
9294772|a|The relative chemical stability of two commercially available polyurethanes-Pellethane, currently used in biomedical devices, and Corethane, considered as a potential biomaterial-was investigated following aging protocols in hydrolytic and oxidative conditions (HOC, water, hydrogen peroxide, and nitric acid) and in physiological media (PHM, phosphate buffer, lipid dispersion, and bile from human donors). The chemical modifications induced on these polymers were characterized using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). With the exception of nitric acid, all of the aging media promoted a mild hydrolytic reaction leading to a slight molecular weight loss in both polymers. When aged in water and hydrogen peroxide, Pellethane experienced structural modifications through microdomain phase separation along with an increase of the order within the soft-hard segment domains. The incubation of Pellethane in nitric acid also resulted in an important decrease of the melting temperature of its hard segments with chain scission mechanisms. Moreover, incubation in PHM led to an increase of the order within shorter hard-segment domains. FTIR data revealed the presence of aliphatic amide molecules used as additives on the Pellethane's surface. The incubation of Corethane under the same conditions promoted an almost uniform molecular reorganization through a phase separation between the hard and soft segments as well as an increase of the short-range order within the hard-segment domains. Incubation of this polymer in nitric acid also resulted in a chain scission process that was less pronounced than that measured for the Pellethane samples. Finally, lipid adsorption occurred on the Corethane sample incubated in bile for 120 days. Overall data indicate that polycarbonate urethane presents a greater chemical stability than does polyetherurethane.

3941391|t|Clearance of furosemide by the gastrointestinal tract.
3941391|a|Approximately 45% of i.v. administered furosemide is eliminated by nonrenal clearance mechanisms. Indirect evidence suggests this might represent intestinal secretion. Therefore, we examined whether the intestinal tract serves as a drug-eliminating organ in man. Intestinal perfusion studies were performed in six healthy volunteers during i.v. furosemide administration (mean serum concentration, 3.74 +/- 0.64 microgram/ml). Subjects were intubated with a multilumen tube which allowed examination of transmucosal water, solute and furosemide movement at separate levels of the gastrointestinal tract. A poorly absorbable electrolyte-mannitol solution was infused in the jejunum (15 ml/min), with polyethylene glycol as a nonabsorbable marker. Furosemide elimination occurred at an equally low rate in all areas of the intestinal tract. Furosemide clearance for the total gastrointestinal tract was 2.1 +/- 0.4 ml/min (mean +/- S.E.M.) compared to a renal clearance of 93.1 +/- 4.6 ml/min. Thus, gastrointestinal elimination amounted to only 2% of renal elimination. The luminal concentration of furosemide in the intestinal tract did not exceed a mean of 0.5 microgram/ml. When the experiments were repeated after administration of probenecid, gut clearance was unchanged but renal clearance was reduced by 70%. In the ileum, furosemide enhanced bicarbonate secretion and induced chloride absorption. We conclude that the intestinal tract contributes only minimally to furosemide elimination in man. From concentration gradients between lumen and plasma and from the fact that probenecid had no effect on elimination rate, it appears likely that active secretion into the intestinal lumen does not occur and that all furosemide appearance in the gut results from passive diffusion.

9610788|t|Human prostate cells synthesize 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 from 25-hydroxyvitamin D3.
9610788|a|Epidemiological and laboratory data support a role for vitamin D in the growth and differentiation of human prostatic cells. These findings prompted us to ask whether prostatic cells could convert 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25-OH-D3), the major circulating metabolite of vitamin D3, to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], the hormonally active metabolite, in a manner similar to cultured human keratinocytes. Therefore, we investigated three well-characterized human prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP, DU 145, and PC-3; two primary cultures of cells derived from noncancerous human prostates (one normal and one benign prostatic hyperplasia); and primary cultures of normal human keratinocytes for their ability to synthesize 1,25(OH)2D3. Assays were performed in the presence of 25-OH-D3 as the enzyme substrate and 1,2-dianilinoethane, an antioxidant and free radical scavenger, and in the presence and absence of clotrimazole, a cytochrome P450 inhibitor. DU 145 and PC-3 cells produced 0.31 +/- 0.06 and 0.07 +/- 0.01 pmol of 1,25(OH)2D3/mg protein/h, respectively. No measurable 1,25(OH)2D3 was detected in LNCaP cells. The normal and benign prostatic hyperplasia primary cultures and keratinocyte cultures produced 3.08 +/- 1.56, 1.05 +/- 0.31, and 2.1 +/- 0.1 pmol of 1,25(OH)2D3/mg protein/h, respectively, using a calf thymus receptor binding assay to measure 1,25(OH)2D3 in the presence of 1,2-dianilinoethane. The identity of the analyte as 1,25(OH)2D3 was supported by high performance liquid chromatography using [3H]25-OH-D3 as the enzyme substrate and a solvent system that is specific for 1,25(OH)2D3. The production of 1,25(OH)2D3 in the prostate cancer cell lines and in the primary cultures was completely inhibited in the presence of clotrimazole. This report demonstrates that two of three human prostate cancer cell lines, as well as primary cultures of noncancerous prostatic cells, possess 1alpha-hydroxylase activity and can synthesize 1,25(OH)2D3 from 25-OH-D3. Together with recent data indicating that 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibits the invasiveness of human prostate cancer cells (G. G. Schwartz et al., Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark. Prev., 6: 727-732, 1997), these data suggest a potential role for 25-OH-D3 in the chemoprevention of invasive prostate cancer.

7894051|t|Low energy charge and high adenosine content in smooth muscle of human bladder in comparison with striated muscle.
7894051|a|This study determined the energy charge, adenosine and inosine content of human bladder smooth muscle in comparison with striated muscle of the same individual. Biopsies were obtained from 21 women who were subjected to urethrocystopexy because of urinary stress incontinence. We found that the ATP content of bladder smooth muscle was only about one-eighth of that of striated muscle. The energy charge of bladder smooth muscle was 0.78 +/- 0.13, which is low compared with striated muscle (0.92 +/- 0.02). The adenosine content of bladder smooth muscle was 6.7 times higher than striated muscle and the adenosine/ATP ratio was 1:9 compared with 1:450 for striated muscle. These findings were in accordance with our previous studies on uterine smooth muscle.

16257351|t|Malondialdehyde-acetaldehyde adducts decrease bronchial epithelial wound repair.
16257351|a|Most people who abuse alcohol are cigarette smokers. Previously, we have shown that malondialdehyde, an inflammation product of lipid peroxidation, and acetaldehyde, a component of both ethanol metabolism and cigarette smoke, form protein adducts that stimulate protein kinase C (PKC) activation in bronchial epithelial cells. We have also shown that PKC can regulate bronchial epithelial cell wound repair. We hypothesize that bovine serum albumin adducted with malondialdehyde and acetaldehyde (BSA-MAA) decreases bronchial epithelial cell wound repair via binding to scavenger receptors on bronchial epithelial cells. To test this, confluent monolayers of bovine bronchial epithelial cells were grown in serum-free media prior to wounding the cells. Bronchial epithelial cell wound closure was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (up to 60%) in the presence of BSA-MAA than in media treated cells (Laboratory of Human Carcinogenesis [LHC]-9-Roswell Park Memorial Institute [RPMI]). The specific scavenger receptor ligand, fucoidan, also stimulated PKC activation and decreased wound repair. Pretreatment with fucoidan blocked malondialdehyde-acetaldehyde binding to bronchial epithelial cells. When bronchial epithelial cells were preincubated with a PKC alpha inhibitor, Gö 6976, the inhibition of wound closure by fucoidan and BSA-MAA was blocked. Western blot demonstrated the presence of several scavenger receptors on bronchial epithelial cell membranes, including SRA, SRBI, SRBII, and CD36. Scavenger receptor-mediated activation of PKC alpha may function to reduce wound healing under conditions of alcohol and cigarette smoke exposure where malondialdehyde-acetaldehyde adducts may be present.

17981329|t|Regulation of hydrogen peroxide release in circulating hemocytes of the planorbid snail Biomphalaria glabrata.
17981329|a|Biomphalaria spp. serve as obligate intermediate hosts for the human blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni. Following S. mansoni penetration of Biomphalaria glabrata, hemocytes of resistant snails migrate towards the parasite, encasing the larva in a multicellular capsule resulting in its destruction via a cytotoxic reaction. Recent studies have revealed the importance of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and nitric oxide (NO) in parasite killing [Hahn UK, Bender RC, Bayne CJ. Killing of Schistosoma mansoni sporocysts by hemocytes from resistant Biomphalaria glabrata: role of reactive oxygen species. J Parasitol 2001;87:292-9; Hahn UK, Bender RC, Bayne CJ. Involvement of nitric oxide in killing of Schistosoma mansoni sporocysts by hemocytes from resistant Biomphalaria glabrata. J Parasitol 2001;87:778-85]. It is assumed that H(2)O(2) and NO production is tightly regulated although the specific molecules involved remain largely unknown. Consequently, the potential role of cell signaling pathways in B. glabrata hemocyte H(2)O(2) production was investigated by evaluating the effects of specific inhibitors of selected signaling proteins. Results suggest that both ERK and p38 MAPKs are involved in the regulation of B. glabrata H(2)O(2) release in response to stimulation by PMA and galactose-conjugated BSA. However, the involvement of the signaling proteins PKC, PI(3) kinase and PLA(2) differs between PMA- and BSA-gal-induced H(2)O(2) production.

17145555|t|Premature cellular senescence induced by pyocyanin, a redox-active Pseudomonas aeruginosa toxin.
17145555|a|Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important nosocomial pathogen that can cause acute and chronic infection, particularly of the respiratory system. Pyocyanin is a major P. aeruginosa virulence factor that displays redox activity and induces oxidative stress in cellular systems. The effect of pyocyanin on replicating human pulmonary epithelial (A549) cells was investigated. Cells were exposed to pyocyanin for 24 h and their subsequent growth and development were followed for 7 days. Pyocyanin (5-10 microM) arrested cell growth and resulted in the development of a morphological phenotype consistent with cellular senescence, that is, an enlarged and flattened appearance. The senescent nature of these cells was supported by positive staining for increased lysosomal content and senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity. All cells treated with pyocyanin (10 microM) converted to the senescent phenotype, which remained stable for up to 7 days. Exposure to pyocyanin at 25 microM or greater resulted in cell death due to apoptosis. A549 cells exposed to pyocyanin generated hydrogen peroxide in a dose-dependent manner and the senescence-inducing effect of pyocyanin was inhibited by the antioxidant, glutathione, suggesting the involvement of reactive oxygen species. The induction of premature cellular senescence by redox-active bacterial toxins may be a hitherto unrecognized aspect of infection pathology and a limiting factor in the tissue repair response to infection.

9115980|t|Conjugation of highly reactive aflatoxin B1 exo-8,9-epoxide catalyzed by rat and human glutathione transferases: estimation of kinetic parameters.
9115980|a|Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) exo-8,9-epoxide, the reactive product of the hepatocarcinogen AFB1, is stable in aprotic solvents but hydrolyzes rapidly in H2O at 25 degrees C and pH 7 (t1/2 = 1 s). However, it is also known that some glutathione (GSH) transferases can conjugate the epoxide with GSH to give the adduct in high yield. We developed an approach to estimating kinetic parameters for reactions involving this epoxide or other substrates that are unstable to H2O. Varying concentrations of the (anhydrous) epoxide and GSH transferase were mixed and the GSH conjugates were measured. The final concentrations of product were known for each set of the starting epoxide and enzyme concentrations in a modeling approach, where the competition with the hydrolysis reaction is considered with two variables, a K for binding of the enzyme and epoxide and a rate k2, which includes microscopic steps following complex formation and resulting in conjugate formation. The ratio k2/K, a measure of enzyme efficiency, varied among individual recombinant GSH transferases in the the order (rat) 10-10 >> 3-3 > (human) M1-1 > T1-1 > A1-1 > P1-1 > A2-2, from 3 x 10(6) to 10 M(-1) s(-1). The high ratio of M1-1 among the human GSH transferase enzymes tested is consistent with other work in which GSH-AFB1 conjugates were not detected in hepatocytes with an M1 null polymorphism. This general kinetic approach should be applicable to estimation of kinetic parameters involved in the interaction of other unstable substrates with enzymes.

12181081|t|Sex steroids do not affect shigatoxin cytotoxicity on human renal tubular or glomerular cells.
12181081|a|BACKGROUND: The greater susceptibility of children to renal injury in post-diarrheal hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) may be related, at least in part, to heightened renal cell sensitivity to the cytotoxic effect of Shiga toxin (Stx), the putative mediator of kidney damage in HUS. We hypothesized that sexual maturation, which coincides with a falling incidence of HUS, may induce a relatively Stx-resistant state in the renal cells. METHODS: Cultured human glomerular endothelial (HGEN), human glomerular visceral epithelial (HGEC) and human proximal tubule (HPT) cells were exposed to Stx-1 after pre-incubation with progesterone, beta-estradiol or testosterone followed by determination of cytotoxicity. RESULTS: Under basal conditions, Stx-1 potently and dose-dependently killed HPT and HGEC, but had relatively little effect on HGEN. Pre-incubation for 1, 2 or 7 days with physiologic or pharmacologic concentrations of progesterone, beta-estradiol or testosterone had no effect on Stx-1 cytotoxicity dose-response on any cell type. In addition, no steroid altered Gb3 expression (Stx receptor) by any cell type at any time point. CONCLUSION: These data do not support the notion that hormonal changes associated with puberty induce an Stx-resistant state within kidney cells.

23572278|t|Common polymorphisms in nitric oxide synthase (NOS) genes influence quality of aging and longevity in humans.
23572278|a|Nitric oxide (NO) triggers multiple signal transduction pathways and contributes to the control of numerous cellular functions. Previous studies have shown in model organisms that the alteration of NO production has important effects on aging and lifespan. We studied in a large sample (763 subjects, age range 19-107 years) the variability of the three human genes (NOS1, -2, -3) coding for the three isoforms of the NADPH-dependent enzymes named NO synthases (NOS) which are responsible of NO synthesis. We have then verified if the variability of these genes is associated with longevity, and with a number of geriatric parameters. We found that gene variation of NOS1 and NOS2 was associated with longevity. In addition NOS1 rs1879417 was also found to be associated with a lower cognitive performance, while NOS2 rs2297518 polymorphism showed to be associated with physical performance. Moreover, SNPs in the NOS1 and NOS3 genes were respectively associated with the presence of depression symptoms and disability, two of the main factors affecting quality of life in older individuals. On the whole, our study shows that genetic variability of NOS genes has an effect on common age related phenotypes and longevity in humans as well as previously reported for model organisms.

7276090|t|Effects of steroids and different culture media on cell cycle of the androgen-sensitive human cell line NHIK3025.
7276090|a|The median cell cycle of synchronized NHIK3025 cells grown in Eagle's MEM with 10% foetal calf serum was 23.6 h, compared to 18 h observed earlier in Puck's E2a medium with 30% serum (20% human and 10% horse). This difference is due to prolongation of both G1 and G2 in the MEM type medium. Testosterone and 4-androstene-3 beta, 17 beta-diol reduced the cell cycle of synchronized populations of NHIK3025 cultured in MEM type medium. Dexamethasone gave cell cycle prolongation while estradiol had no effect. These results are in accordance with steroid-induced changes in growth of asynchronous cell populations observed earlier. The androgen growth stimulation was partly due to a shortening of G2 but was not exclusively located in one particular phase of the cell cycle.

25800560|t|Mitochondria defects are involved in lead-acetate-induced adult hematopoietic stem cell decline.
25800560|a|Occupational high-grade lead exposure has been reduced in recent decades as a result of increased regulation. However, environmental lead exposure remains widespread, and is associated with severe toxicity implicated in human diseases. We performed oral intragastric administration of various dose lead acetate to adult Sprague Dawley rats to define the role of lead exposure in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) function, and to clarify its underlying mechanism. Lead acetate-exposed rats exhibited developmental abnormalities in myeloid and lymphoid lineages, and a significant decline in immune functions. It also showed HSCs functional decline associated with senescent phenotype with low grade lead acetate exposure or apoptotic phenotype with relative higher grade dose exposure. Mechanistic exploration showed a significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the lead acetate-exposed CD90(+)CD45(-) compartment, which correlated with functional defects in cellular mitochondria. Furthermore, in vivo treatment with the antioxidant vitamin C led to reversion of the CD90(+)CD45(-) compartment functional decline. These results indicate that lead acetate perturbs the hematopoietic balance of adult HSCs, associated with cellular mitochondria defects, increased intracellular ROS generation.

7727625|t|Choline ingestion increases the resonance of choline-containing compounds in human brain: an in vivo proton magnetic resonance study.
7727625|a|Choline is a crucial intermediate in several clinically relevant neurochemical processes. In this study, choline-containing compounds in human brain (principally phosphocholine, glycero-phosphocholine, and choline) were measured by 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, before and after the ingestion of 50 mg/kg choline in four normal control subjects. Substantial and remarkably similar increases in the brain choline resonance occurred in each subject, with a nearly two-fold rise in the choline resonance observed 3 hr following choline ingestion (p = 0.008 versus baseline). One subject also received a dose of 200 mg/kg choline, and exhibited a proportionally larger increase in the brain choline resonance. The results are consistent with animal data reporting a rise in choline-containing compounds following choline administration. This is the first study to our knowledge where an oral nutrient has been shown to produce a detectable change in human brain composition in vivo. Studying choline transport and biotransformation in human brain may have relevance to several neuropsychiatric disorders, including affective disorders and dementia.

7520998|t|DNA damage and stress protein synthesis induced by oxidative stress proceed independently in the human premonocytic line U937.
7520998|a|Heat shock proteins (HSPs) function as stress-inducible molecular chaperones and exert protective effects against cellular injury. The induction of the HSPs is considered to be mediated by the presence of abnormal proteins within the cell and/or by classical second messengers. Several lines of evidence have however suggested a relationship between DNA damage, HSP induction and thermotolerance. We investigated whether DNA alterations could represent a common signal for the induction of stress protein synthesis during heat shock or exposure to reactive oxygen species in the human premonocytic line U937. We measured, in parallel, DNA damage (both strand breaks and fragmentation) and HSP synthesis (by biometabolic labeling and Western blotting) after exposure to heat shock, hydrogen peroxide, bleomycin, cadmium or erythrophagocytosis. Heat shock induced DNA alterations along with HSP synthesis. In contrast, exposure to hydrogen peroxide or bleomycin induced DNA damage, but no HSP synthesis, suggesting that oxidation-induced DNA damage and HSP synthesis proceed independently in U937 cells. Erythrophagocytosis and cadmium induced the classical HSPs but no detectable DNA damage. Since these latter stresses also induced the oxidation-specific stress protein heme oxygenase, we suggest a protective role for heme oxygenase against oxidative DNA damage.

27783672|t|The L-Arginine Transporter Solute Carrier Family 7 Member 2 Mediates the Immunopathogenesis of Attaching and Effacing Bacteria.
27783672|a|Solute carrier family 7 member 2 (SLC7A2) is an inducible transporter of the semi-essential amino acid L-arginine (L-Arg), which has been implicated in immune responses to pathogens. We assessed the role of SLC7A2 in murine infection with Citrobacter rodentium, an attaching and effacing enteric pathogen that causes colitis. Induction of SLC7A2 was upregulated in colitis tissues, and localized predominantly to colonic epithelial cells. Compared to wild-type mice, Slc7a2-/-mice infected with C. rodentium had improved survival and decreased weight loss, colon weight, and histologic injury; this was associated with decreased colonic macrophages, dendritic cells, granulocytes, and Th1 and Th17 cells. In infected Slc7a2-/-mice, there were decreased levels of the proinflammatory cytokines G-CSF, TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-1β, and the chemokines CXCL1, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CXCL2, and CCL5. In bone marrow chimeras, the recipient genotype drove the colitis phenotype, indicative of the importance of epithelial, rather than myeloid SLC7A2. Mice lacking Slc7a2 exhibited reduced adherence of C. rodentium to the colonic epithelium and decreased expression of Talin-1, a focal adhesion protein involved in the attachment of the bacterium. The importance of SLC7A2 and Talin-1 in the intimate attachment of C. rodentium and induction of inflammatory response was confirmed in vitro, using conditionally-immortalized young adult mouse colon (YAMC) cells with shRNA knockdown of Slc7a2 or Tln1. Inhibition of L-Arg uptake with the competitive inhibitor, L-lysine (L-Lys), also prevented attachment of C. rodentium and chemokine expression. L-Lys and siRNA knockdown confirmed the role of L-Arg and SLC7A2 in human Caco-2 cells co-cultured with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. Overexpression of SLC7A2 in human embryonic kidney cells increased bacterial adherence and chemokine expression. Taken together, our data indicate that C. rodentium enhances its own pathogenicity by inducing the expression of SLC7A2 to favor its attachment to the epithelium and thus create its ecological niche.

3581486|t|Effects of chlorothiazide, furosemide and PTH on Na+ and Ca2+ handling in isolated perfused kidneys of the spontaneously hypertensive rat.
3581486|a|The role of the kidney in a disturbed calcium metabolism in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) was investigated. The hemodynamics of isolated perfused SHR kidneys were not basically altered compared to Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) control kidneys. Renal calcium handling by isolated perfused WKY and SHR kidneys at 12 weeks of age was not significantly different. In addition, the effects of chlorothiazide and furosemide on renal calcium handling were studied in isolated perfused kidneys from both rat strains. Both diuretics increased glomerular filtration rate, diuresis and excretion of sodium and calcium. However, both diuretics stimulated diuresis and calcium excretion significantly less in SHR than in WKY kidneys. The calciuric action of chlorothiazide was completely abolished by administration of human-parathyroidhormone (hPTH), while the natriuric effect was unchanged by hPTH. This observation suggests that a hypocalciuric action of chlorothiazide 'in vivo' is possibly mediated by PTH. Our study suggests that the kidney is not responsible for the disturbance in calcium metabolism in SHR. A surprising finding is that the SHR kidney was less responsive to the diuretics furosemide and chlorothiazide than the kidney of the WKY control.

3998144|t|Carbohydrate fermentation in the human colon and its relation to acetate concentrations in venous blood.
3998144|a|There is now substantial evidence that some dietary polysaccharides, notably dietary fiber, escape absorption in the small bowel and are then broken down in the large intestine of man. The main end products of this colonic digestive process, which is anerobic, are short chain fatty acids (SCFA), and acetic, propionic, and butyric acids. Although these acids are known to be absorbed from the colon, their subsequent fate and significance is unknown. We have measured venous blood SCFA levels in healthy subjects after a 16-h fast, and then following oral doses of either 50 mmol SCFA, 5, 10, or 20 g doses of the fermentable carbohydrate lactulose, or 20 g of pectin. Fasting venous blood acetate was 53.8 +/- 4.4 mumol/liter (SEM) (n = 14). Fasting arterial blood acetate, taken simultaneously with venous blood in six subjects, was higher; 125.6 +/- 13.5 mumol/liter (arterial) vs. 61.1 +/- 6.9 mumol/liter (venous). Significant levels of propionate or butyrate were not detected in any blood samples. Following an oral dose of 50 mmol mixed SCFA, venous blood acetate reached a peak of 194.1 +/- 57.9 mumol/liter at 45 min and returned to fasting levels at 2 h. Blood acetate also rose in response to lactulose, peak levels occurring 2-4 h after the dose: 5 g, 98.6 +/- 23.1 mumol/liter; 10 g, 127.3 +/- 18.2 mumol/liter; and 20 g, 181.3 +/- 23.9 mumol/liter. Pectin fermentation was much slower, with blood acetate levels starting to rise after 6 h and remaining elevated at about twice fasting levels for the subsequent 18 h. However, areas under the blood acetate curves were closely related (r = 0.97; n = 5), whatever the source of acetate. These studies show that the large intestine makes an important contribution to blood acetate levels in man and that fermentation may influence metabolic processes well beyond the wall of this organ.

25108309|t|Repetitive magnetic stimulation induces plasticity of excitatory postsynapses on proximal dendrites of cultured mouse CA1 pyramidal neurons.
25108309|a|Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the human brain can lead to long-lasting changes in cortical excitability. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms which underlie rTMS-induced plasticity remain incompletely understood. Here, we used repetitive magnetic stimulation (rMS) of mouse entorhino-hippocampal slice cultures to study rMS-induced plasticity of excitatory postsynapses. By employing whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons, local electrical stimulations, immunostainings for the glutamate receptor subunit GluA1 and compartmental modeling, we found evidence for a preferential potentiation of excitatory synapses on proximal dendrites of CA1 neurons (2-4 h after stimulation). This rMS-induced synaptic potentiation required the activation of voltage-gated sodium channels, L-type voltage-gated calcium channels and N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptors. In view of these findings we propose a cellular model for the preferential strengthening of excitatory synapses on proximal dendrites following rMS in vitro, which is based on a cooperative effect of synaptic glutamatergic transmission and postsynaptic depolarization.

1857197|t|Characterization of the Helicobacter pylori urease and purification of its subunits.
1857197|a|Helicobacter pylori (formerly Campylobacter pylori) is the causative agent of gastritis in man. Helicobacter pylori cells contain a large amount of an extremely active urease (E.C.3.5.1.5). This enzyme is suspected to be a virulence factor since the ammonium ion produced from urea may be responsible for tissue injury and/or survival of H. pylori in the gastric environment. Helicobacter pylori urease, native relative molecular mass approximately 600,000, was purified by agarose gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. DEAE-purified urease is highly active and has a Km of 0.48 mM for urea. The enzyme has a pI of 5.93 and is active from pH 4.0 to 10.0, with an optimum at pH 8.0. The purified urease contains nickel and is composed of two protein subunits, with relative molecular masses of 66,000 and 31,000. The subunits were separated and purified and the first 30 N-terminal amino acid residues were determined. A remarkably close relationship was found between both H. pylori urease subunits and jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis) urease, the subunit of which is a single 840 amino acid polypeptide. This subunit is also largely identical to the high molecular mass subunits of the ureases of Klebsiella aerogenes and Proteus mirabilis, evidence that these four ureases are derived from a common ancestral protein.

17973460|t|Amperometric response from the glycolytic versus the pentose phosphate pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells.
17973460|a|The two main metabolic pathways involved in sugar metabolism, i.e., the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and the glycolytic pathway (GP), were amperometrically monitored using a double-mediator system composed of menadione and ferricyanide. With the use of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae deletion mutant, EBY44, lacking the gene encoding for the branch point enzyme phosphoglucose isomerize, selective amperometric monitoring of the PPP, mainly producing NADPH, and the GP, mainly producing NADH, could be achieved. It was found that the bioelectrocatalytic current was primarily originating from NADPH. This conclusion was supported by metabolite flux analysis, confirming that, in the presence of menadione, the cells increase the rate of NADPH-producing reactions although these processes might be detrimental to cell survival. The higher rate of in vivo NADPH-dependent menadione reduction can be ascribed to the fact that the intracellular NADPH/NADP(+) ratio is much higher than NADH/NAD(+) as well as that the former ratio is more tightly controlled. This tight control over the cofactor ratios is lost upon cell disintegration as observed from spectrophotometric assays using crude cell extract, and amperometric investigations of permeabilized cells indicate a higher rate of NADH- than NADPH-dependent menadione reduction. These in vitro experiments show a higher activity of NADH-dependent than NADPH-dependent menadione-reducing dehydrogenases in S. cerevisiae cells.

776942|t|Morphogenic effects of alpha-factor on Saccharomyces cerevisiae a cells.
776942|a|Saccharomyces cerevisiae mating type a cells enlarged and elongated when exposed to alpha-factor, a sex pheromone produced by mating-type alpha cells. This morphogensis required exogenous-D-glucose, nitrogen, and phosphate, and cells in exponential phase responded better than stationary-phase cells. Morphogenesis was blocked by cycloheximide and by inhibitors of cell wall biosynthesis such as 2-deoxy-D-glucose, 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose, and 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-mannose, but not by polyoxin D. One to two hours after addition of pheromone, a cells became more susceptible to lysis by glucanases, a change that was dependendent on the dose of alpha-factor and was blocked by drugs that block morphogenesis. On the other hand, treatment with alpha-factor did not increase susceptibility to attack by trypsin, subtilisin, or exo-alpha-mannanase. Radioactive label, incorporated into cell wall polysaccharides during treatment with alpha-factor, was not secreted into the medium during morphogenesis. Analysis of the labeled wall polymers showed that alpha-factor-treated cells contain more glucan and less mannan than control cells, and that the mannan of treated cells contains an increased proportion of shorter side chains and unsubstituted backbone mannose units. Thin-section electron microscopy of treated cells revealed that the cell wall possesses a diffuse outer layer in the extension and is thinner at the tip.

12672372|t|Calculation of bovine haemoglobin oxygen saturation by algorithms integrating age, haemoglobin content, blood pH, partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood, and temperature.
12672372|a|In human and veterinary medicine, arterial and venous haemoglobin oxygen saturations are often used to estimate the severity of a disease and to guide therapeutic decisions. In veterinary medicine, haemoglobin oxygen saturation (SO(2)) is usually calculated using a blood gas analyser and algorithms developed for humans. It is possible, therefore, that the values obtained in animals may be distorted, particularly in animals with a high haemoglobin oxygen affinity, like young calves. In order to verify this hypothesis, we compared the arterial (SaO(2)) and venous (SvO(2)) haemoglobin oxygen saturations calculated using three different algorithms, and the oxygen exchange fraction (OEF) at the tissue level, which is the degree of haemoglobin desaturation between arterial and venous blood (SaO(2)-SvO(2)), with the values obtained from the whole bovine oxygen equilibrium curve (OEC) determined by a reference method. The blood gas analysers underestimated SvO(2) values; consequently, the OEF was overestimated (by about 10%). Two methods of reducing these errors were assessed. As the haemoglobin oxygen affinity decreases during the first month of life in calves a relationship between PO(2) at 50% haemoglobin saturation (P50) and age was established in order to correct the calculated values of venous and arterial SO(2), taking into account the estimated position of the OEC. This method markedly reduced the error for SvO(2) and OEF. Secondly, the SO(2) was calculated using a mathematical model taking into account the age of the animal and the specific effects of pH, PCO(2), and temperature on the bovine OEC. Using this method, the mean difference between the OEF values calculated using the mathematical model and those calculated by the reference method was close to zero. The errors produced by blood gas analysers can thus be minimised in two ways: firstly, by simply introducing a P50 estimated from the age of the calf into the analyser before the measurement; and secondly, by calculating the SO(2) using a mathematical model applied to the bovine OEC.

8921182|t|Continuous assay for acid phosphatase using phenyl phosphate.
8921182|a|A continuous spectrophotometric assay for the determination of the initial rate of an acid phosphatase-catalyzed reaction in an acidic environment, using phenyl phosphate as a substrate, is presented. The method is based on the continuous determination of phenol, a product of the enzymatic hydrolysis, by the kinetic measurement of its absorbance. The method allows for the direct estimation of acid phosphatase activity in an acidic solution. This is possible without interrupting the reaction by alkalization or precipitation required for commonly used end-point colorimetric detection procedures for phosphate or phenol, and without the use of any coupled assays. The method has been developed for acid phosphatase activity determination in an aqueous solution and in sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate (AOT)-isooctane-water reverse micelles in a broad pH range (pH 3.8 to 8.8). The proposed procedure has been used for the determination of kinetic constants (K(m) and kcat) for human prostatic acid phosphatase in aqueous solutions, and in AOT-isooctane-water reverse micelles, at pH 3.8, 4.5, and 5.7.

10533294|t|Intrarenal infusion of supernatant from cytokine-activated human mesangial cells may cause glomerular damage.
10533294|a|BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of glomerular damage in glomerulonephritis (GN) is not fully understood. Several studies have suggested that reactive oxygen molecules play a role in renal disease. It is known that, during GN, mesangial cells are activated. In a previous study, we demonstrated that in vitro interleukin (IL)-1 plus IL-6 stimulated cultured human mesangial cell (HMC) activation to release free oxygen radicals. METHODS: In this study, we measured hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide anion (O2-) levels after stimulation by IL-1 plus IL-6 in cultured HMCs. We then infused H2O2 directly into the left renal arteries of Sprague-Dawley rats. We also infused the culture supernatants of HMCs after stimulation by IL-1 plus IL-6 into the left renal arteries of rats. Two hours after stopping the infusion, the kidneys were removed and fixed using Carson's modified Millonig's buffer for electron microscopy. RESULTS: Both 100 microM H2O2 and supernatants of HMCs stimulated by IL-1 10 U/ml plus IL-6 1,000 U/ml caused similar glomerular damage, including blebbing and sloughing of endothelial cells, and denuded basement membrane in glomeruli. When 100 microM H2O2 or supernatants of cytokine-activated HMCs were infused into renal arteries, they caused hematuria and proteinuria. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that activated HMCs may secrete free radicals and cause glomerular damage.

18503006|t|Saccharomyces cerevisiae Grx6 and Grx7 are monothiol glutaredoxins associated with the early secretory pathway.
18503006|a|Saccharomyces cerevisiae Grx6 and Grx7 are two monothiol glutaredoxins whose active-site sequences (CSYS and CPYS, respectively) are reminiscent of the CPYC active-site sequence of classical dithiol glutaredoxins. Both proteins contain an N-terminal transmembrane domain which is responsible for their association to membranes of the early secretory pathway vesicles, facing the luminal side. Thus, Grx6 localizes at the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi compartments, while Grx7 is mostly at the Golgi. Expression of GRX6 is modestly upregulated by several stresses (calcium, sodium, and peroxides) in a manner dependent on the Crz1-calcineurin pathway. Some of these stresses also upregulate GRX7 expression under the control of the Msn2/4 transcription factor. The N glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin induces the expression of both genes along with protein accumulation. Mutants lacking both glutaredoxins display reduced sensitivity to tunicamycin, although the drug is still able to manifest its inhibitory effect on a reporter glycoprotein. Grx6 and Grx7 have measurable oxidoreductase activity in vivo, which is increased in the presence of tunicamycin. Both glutaredoxins could be responsible for the regulation of the sulfhydryl oxidative state at the oxidant conditions of the early secretory pathway vesicles. However, the differences in location and expression responses against stresses suggest that their functions are not totally overlapping.

9590514|t|Ethanol enhances cholesterol synthesis and secretion in human hepatomal cells.
9590514|a|Excessive consumption of alcohol leads to severe alterations of lipid metabolism, including hyperlipemia and hypercholesterolemia. Following these epidemiological observations, we investigated the effects of ethanol at the cellular level by employing a human hepatomal cell line (HepG2) and by evaluating the biosyntheses of lipid classes from different labeled precursors. Incubation of cells with 2% ethanol resulted in a decreased labeling of phospholipids and in an increase in cholesterol synthesis and secretion. Triglyceride synthesis was increased by ethanol but their secretion in the medium was reduced, suggesting that these alterations may be related to their accumulation in the liver. The alcohol-induced alterations of lipid metabolism are not due to its metabolite acetaldehyde and data suggest that alcohol enhances cholesterol synthesis by affecting the initial steps without increasing HMGCoA expression. The observed modifications of lipid metabolism in HepG2 may partially explain the enhanced incidence of cardiovascular disorders that has been associated with alcoholism.

7968675|t|Coaggregation between Porphyromonas gingivalis and mutans streptococci.
7968675|a|Coaggregation occurred between Porphyromonas gingivalis and mutans streptococci. The coaggregation was completely inhibited by L-arginine, N alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), and a trypsin inhibitor, and weakly inhibited by L-lysine, N-ethylmaleimide, lysozyme, and human whole saliva. The results of heat and proteinase K treatment suggested that a heat-labile proteinaceous substance of P. gingivalis and a heat-stable substance of mutans streptococci may play a role in the coaggregation. Mutans streptococci also aggregated in the presence of the heat-labile factor in the supernatant of P. gingivalis. The aggregation was also inhibited by L-arginine, TLCK, and a trypsin inhibitor.

19883376|t|Brd2 disruption in mice causes severe obesity without Type 2 diabetes.
19883376|a|Certain human subpopulations are metabolically healthy but obese, or metabolically obese but normal weight; such mutations uncouple obesity from glucose intolerance, revealing pathways implicated in Type 2 diabetes. Current searches for relevant genes consume significant effort. We have reported previously a novel double bromodomain protein called Brd2, which is a transcriptional co-activator/co-repressor with SWI/SNF (switch mating type/sucrose non-fermenting)-like functions that regulates chromatin. In the present study, we show that wholebody disruption of Brd2, an unusual MHC gene, causes lifelong severe obesity in mice with pancreatic islet expansion, hyperinsulinaemia, hepatosteatosis and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines, but, surprisingly, enhanced glucose tolerance, elevated adiponectin, increased weight of brown adipose tissue, heat production and expression of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins in brown adipose tissue, reduced macrophage infiltration in white adipose tissue, and lowered blood glucose, leading to an improved metabolic profile and avoiding eventual Type 2 diabetes. Brd2 is highly expressed in pancreatic beta-cells, where it normally inhibits beta-cell mitosis and insulin transcription. In 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes, Brd2 normally co-represses PPAR-gamma (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-gamma) and inhibits adipogenesis. Brd2 knockdown protects 3T3-L1 adipocytes from TNF-alpha (tumour necrosis factor-alpha)-induced insulin resistance, thereby decoupling inflammation from insulin resistance. Thus hypomorphic Brd2 shifts energy balance toward storage without causing glucose intolerance and may provide a novel model for obese metabolically healthy humans.

18326758|t|Implication of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase in inhibition of TNF-alpha- and IL-1beta-induced expression of inflammatory mediators by AICAR in RPE cells.
18326758|a|PURPOSE: AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been suggested to be a novel signaling pathway in regulating inflammation. The role of AMPK in retinal pigment epithelial cell inflammatory response is addressed using AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside (AICAR). METHODS: Protein expression and activation of signaling molecules were detected by immunoblotting. Cytokines were determined by ELISA kits. AMPKalpha expression was knockdown by siRNAs. RESULTS: AICAR inhibited tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha- or interleukin (IL)-1beta-induced production of IL-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 and of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 expression in human RPE cells. The inhibitory effect on cytokine production and ICAM-1 expression persisted in the RPE cells in which AMPK was knocked down by AMPK siRNA. Moreover, an adenosine kinase inhibitor 5'-iodotubercidin, which effectively abolished AMPK activation caused by AICAR, did not reverse the anti-inflammatory effect of AICAR. In comparison, anti-inflammatory effects of AICAR were mimicked by adenosine but not inosine, the metabolites of AICAR. Finally, with the exception of TNF-alpha-induced IL-6 production, adenosine dialdehyde, an inhibitor of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, was found to block cytokine production and ICAM-1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the ability of AICAR to activate AMPK, the inhibitory effects of AICAR on cytokine production and ICAM-1 expression were not associated with AMPK. The mechanism of AICAR inhibition may be attributed to the interference of adenosylmethionine-dependent methylation.

12150722|t|Mechanism of apoptotic effects induced by 5-fluorouracil on human liver carcinoma Bel7402 cell line.
12150722|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of endogenous nitric oxide (NO) on the ability of 5-fluourouracil (5-FU) to induce apoptosis in the liver carcinoma Bel7402 cell line, and to observe the anti-tumor mechanism and effective adjuvant of 5-FU. METHODS: Cells were cultured under routine conditions with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) without L-Arginine (L-Arg). We observed the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and apoptosis of cells induced by 5-FU with L-Arg added to the medium. The production of nitric oxide was determined by the cell expression of iNOS detected by immunohistochemical staining, and by the concentrations of nitrite and nitrate in the supernatant. RESULTS: 5-fluourouracil significantly increased the iNOS expression to 0.1687 +/- 0.01968 (P < 0.05, vs control group), and the concentration of nitric oxide to 213 +/- 30.2 micromol/L (P < 0.05, vs control group). The apoptotic cell rate increased significantly to 17.85 +/- 0.78%, while the necrotic cell rate decreased to 3 2.99 +/- 0.83% (P < 0.05,compared with the 5-FU group). N(omega)-nitro-L-Arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), the antagonist of L-Arg, can block the apoptotic effects of endogenous nitric oxide. CONCLUSIONS: 5-FU had a synergistic effects with L-Arg by increasing the production of endogenous nitric oxide. Endogenous nitric oxide plays an important role in the process where 5-FU induces apoptosis in liver carcinoma cells. L-Arg may be a good adjuvant for chemotherapy with 5-FU.

7025889|t|Study of transfer ribonucleic acid unfolding by dynamic nuclear magnetic resonance.
7025889|a|Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements of proton exchange were performed on yeast tRNAPhe, and in much less detail on Escherichia coli tRNAfMet, over a range of Mg2+ concentrations and temperatures, at neutral pH and 0.1 M NaCl. The resonances studied were those of ring nitrogen protons, resonating between 10 and 15 ppm downfield from sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)-1-propanesulfonate, which partake in hydrogen bonding between bases of secondary and tertiary pairs. Methods include saturation--recovery, line width, and real-time observation after a change to deuterated solvent. The relevant theory is briefly reviewed. We believe that most of the higher temperature rates reflect major unfolding of the molecule. For E. coli tRNAfMet, the temperature dependence of the rate for the U8--A14 resonance maps well onto previous optical T-jump studies for a transition assigned to tertiary melting. For yeast tRNAPhe, exchange rates of several resolved protons could be studied from 30 to 45 degrees C in zero Mg2+ concentration and had activation energies on the order of 40 kcal/mol. Initially, the tertiary structure melts, followed shortly by the acceptor stem. At high Mg2+ concentration, relatively few exchange rates are measurable below the general cooperative melt at about 60 degrees C; these are attributed to tertiary changes. Real-time observations suggest a change in the exchange mechanism at room temperature with a lower activation energy. The results are compared with those obtained by other methods directed toward assaying ribonucleic acid dynamics.

26427606|t|SCN4A pore mutation pathogenetically contributes to autosomal dominant essential tremor and may increase susceptibility to epilepsy.
26427606|a|Essential tremor (ET) is the most prevalent movement disorder, affecting millions of people in the USA. Although a positive family history is one of the most important risk factors for ET, the genetic causes of ET remain unknown. In an attempt to identify genetic causes for ET, we performed whole-exome sequencing analyses in a large Spanish family with ET, in which two patients also developed epilepsy. To further assess pathogenicity, site-directed mutagenesis, mouse and human brain expression analyses, and patch clamp techniques were performed. A disease-segregating mutation (p.Gly1537Ser) in the SCN4A gene was identified. Posterior functional analyses demonstrated that more rapid kinetics at near-threshold potentials altered ion selectivity and facilitated the conductance of both potassium and ammonium ions, which could contribute to tremor and increase susceptibility to epilepsy, respectively. In this report, for the first time, we associated the genetic variability of SCN4A with the development of essential tremor, which adds ET to the growing list of neurological channelopathies.

19001419|t|Reconstitution of human Ero1-Lalpha/protein-disulfide isomerase oxidative folding pathway in vitro. Position-dependent differences in role between the a and a' domains of protein-disulfide isomerase.
19001419|a|Protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI), a critical enzyme responsible for oxidative protein folding in the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum, is composed of four thioredoxin domains a, b, b', a', and a linker x between b' and a'. Ero1-Lalpha, an oxidase for human PDI (hPDI), has been determined to have one molecular flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as its prosthetic group. Oxygen consumption assays with purified recombinant Ero1-Lalpha revealed that it utilizes oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor producing one disulfide bond and one molecule of hydrogen peroxide per dioxygen molecule consumed. Exogenous FAD is not required for recombinant Ero1-Lalpha activity. By monitoring the reactivation of denatured and reduced RNase A, we reconstituted the Ero1-Lalpha/hPDI oxidative folding system in vitro and determined the enzymatic activities of hPDI in this system. Mutagenesis studies suggested that the a' domain of hPDI is much more active than the a domain in Ero1-Lalpha-mediated oxidative folding. A domain swapping study revealed that one catalytic thioredoxin domain to the C-terminal of bb'x, whether a or a', is essential in Ero1-Lalpha-mediated oxidative folding. These data, combined with a pull-down assay and isothermal titration calorimetry measurements, enabled the minimal element for binding with Ero1-Lalpha to be mapped to the b'xa' fragment of hPDI.

9048974|t|The ATP-induced K(+)-transport pathway of yeast mitochondria may function as an uncoupling pathway.
9048974|a|The effect of the presence of K+ during oxidative phosphorylation measured on isolated yeast mitochondria was dependent on phosphate concentration. At 0.5 mM phosphate, K+ did promote an uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, which was prevented by decavanadate, a potent inhibitor of the ATP-induced K(+)-transport pathway. AT 5 mM phosphate, no uncoupling effect of K+ could be evidenced. These data suggest that the ATP-induced K(+)-transport pathway may, under certain conditions, function as an uncoupling pathway of oxidative phosphorylation.

15918002|t|An indium:calcium phosphate colloid that specifically targets fibrin.
15918002|a|The ability of indium to target fibrin in vitro was evaluated. The radionuclide (114m)Indium (114mIn) was prepared as a soluble and colloidal (In:In) form, as well as, a mixed indium:calcium phosphate (In:CaP) colloid. Soluble 114mIn was prepared by maintaining acid pH (50 mM HCl). Colloidal 114mIn (In:In) was prepared under slightly basic conditions (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.6). The mixed In:CaP colloid was prepared by incubation of 114mIn with calcium (10 mM) and phosphate (250 microM) under slightly basic conditions (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.6). To assess fibrin binding, the three 114mIn preparations were mixed with diluted human plasma (source of fibrinogen). Fibrin polymerization was initiated by addition of calcium (5 mM) and thrombin (0.5 U/ml). Following incubation (15 min, 37 degrees C), the fibrin matrix was condensed, removed from the reaction mixture, and washed briefly. Fibrin uptake of 114mIn (soluble, colloidal, or In:CaP) was determined by gamma counting. Results demonstrated that soluble 114mIn exclusively bound a plasma protein electrophoretically and immunologically identified as transferrin. Although both colloidal 114mIn and 114mIn:CaP bound fibrin, the mixed 114mIn:CaP colloid demonstrated substantially higher fibrin binding activity (about 2-fold). The target of indium binding was confirmed as fibrin due to the presence of characteristic cross-linked gamma-gamma dimers (100 kDa) and beta-monomers (58 kDa) by SDS-PAGE. 114mIn colloid and the mixed 114mIn:CaP colloid demonstrated no ability to bind fibrin's precursor, fibrinogen. 114mIn:CaP fibrin binding was associated with formation of CaP, as evidenced by its dependence on phosphate concentration. The biocompatibility of CaP including its ability to bind 114mIn and specifically target fibrin may be of potential value for diagnostic imaging studies to identify regions of occult vascular stenosis (i.e., atherosclerotic plaques, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus).

7829968|t|Ligation of CD23 activates soluble guanylate cyclase in human monocytes via an L-arginine-dependent mechanism.
7829968|a|Transduction through Fc epsilon R2/CD23 was analyzed in normal human monocytes using immunoglobulin E (IgE)-anti-IgE immune complexes (IgE ICs) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to CD23. Anti-CD23 mAb and IgE IC triggered a time-dependent increase in cGMP and cAMP in interleukin-4-preincubated (CD23+) but not in unstimulated (CD23-) monocytes. Maximal cGMP and cAMP accumulations were observed 10 and 20 min, respectively, after the onset of CD23 ligation. The increase in cGMP was inhibited with N omega-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), which also partially affected cAMP accumulation. Addition of an anti-CD23 mAb Fab fragment inhibited the IgE IC- and the anti-CD23 mAb-induced cGMP and cAMP accumulation, confirming the engagement of CD23. In addition, IgE IC and anti-CD23 mAb induced, at least in some donors, a production of nitrite that was inhibited in the presence of L-NMMA. Taken together, these findings suggest a possible involvement of the nitric oxide synthase pathway in IgE IC-mediated activation of CD23+ monocytes.

21390495|t|Tamoxifen metabolites as active inhibitors of aromatase in the treatment of breast cancer.
21390495|a|The mechanism of tamoxifen action in the treatment of breast cancer is believed to be via active metabolites that act as potent estrogen receptor antagonists. Attempts to identify relationships between active metabolite concentrations and clinical outcomes have produced mixed results. Since anti-estrogenic effects may be brought about not only by estrogen antagonism, but also by reduced estrogen synthesis, we tested the ability of tamoxifen and its principal metabolites to inhibit aromatase in vitro. The activity of human aromatase in both recombinant and placental microsomal preparations was measured using the rate of generation of a fluorescent metabolite in the presence and absence of multiple concentrations of tamoxifen, endoxifen, N-desmethyl-tamoxifen, and Z-4-hydroxy-tamoxifen. Aromatase inhibition was further characterized by measuring the inhibition of testosterone metabolism to estradiol. The biochemical mechanisms of inhibition were documented and their inhibitory potency was compared. Using recombinant human aromatase, endoxifen, and N-desmethyl-tamoxifen were able to inhibit aromatase activity with K                         (i) values of 4.0 and 15.9 μM, respectively. Detailed characterization of inhibition by endoxifen and N-desmethyl-tamoxifen indicated non-competitive kinetics for both inhibitors. Similarly, endoxifen-inhibited testosterone metabolism via a non-competitive mechanism. No appreciable inhibition by tamoxifen or Z-4-hydroxy-tamoxifen was observed at similar concentrations. The relative inhibitory potency was: endoxifen > N-desmethyl-tamoxifen >>> Z-4-hydroxy-tamoxifen > tamoxifen. Similar data were obtained in human placental microsomes. Endoxifen and N-desmethyl-tamoxifen were found to be potent inhibitors of aromatase. Inhibition by these tamoxifen metabolites may contribute to the variability in clinical effects of tamoxifen in patients with breast cancer. Relationships between tamoxifen metabolite concentrations and clinical outcomes may be complex, and the biologic mechanisms that underlie these relationships may include aromatase inhibition.

3467651|t|Changes in superoxide dismutase, catalase, and the glutathione cycle during induced myeloid differentiation.
3467651|a|The human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 undergoes induced myeloid differentiation, with acquisition of most polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) functions, including generation of toxic oxygen species. We examined the concurrent changes in the cellular detoxifying defenses against superoxide and H2O2: superoxide dismutase, catalase, and the glutathione cycle. During induced differentiation, total superoxide dismutase activity declined to a level slightly more than 2-fold that of PMN, largely due to a decrease in Mn-superoxide dismutase; CuZn-superoxide dismutase showed virtually no change. Catalase activity declined only slightly (but significantly) to a level 1.3 that of PMN. GSH peroxidase activity fell and then rose back to its original level, remaining throughout differentiation more than 10-fold higher than activity in PMN. GSSG reductase activity declined to a level of 73% that of uninduced cells but twice that of PMN. GSH and GSSG contents both decreased, reaching equivalence to those of PMN. Concurrently, the ability of the cells to generate H2O2 increased 11-fold, a change similar to that previously reported for superoxide production. Thus, there is a paradoxical inverse relationship between the development of active oxygen generation and scavenging systems during myeloid differentiation in HL-60 cells.

25539717|t|Quantitative detection of free 24S-hydroxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol from human serum.
25539717|a|BACKGROUND: Cholesterol metabolism is important for the maintenance of myelin and neuronal membranes in the central nervous system. Blood concentrations of the brain specific cholesterol metabolite 24S-hydroxysterol to the peripheral metabolite 27-hydroxycholesterol may be useful surrogate markers for neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders, and Multiple Sclerosis. However, current methods to isolate hydroxycholesterols are labor intensive, prone to produce variable extraction efficiencies and do not discriminate between free and esterfied forms of hydroxycholesterols. Since free hydroxycholesterols are the biologically active form of these sterols, separating free from esterfied forms may provide a sensitive measure to identify disease-associated differences in brain sterol metabolism. RESULTS: We found that average human serum concentrations were 12.3 ± 4.79 ng/ml for free 24(s)-hydroxycholesterol and 17.7 ± 8.5 ng/ml for 27-hydroxycholesterol. CONCLUSION: Serum measurements of these biologically active oxysterols may be useful surrogate measures for brain health in a variety of neurodegenerative conditions.

3548591|t|Autoconditioning factor relieves ethanol-induced growth inhibition of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
3548591|a|Viable Saccharomyces cerevisiae suspended in medium containing growth-inhibiting concentrations of ethanol produce a metabolite that relieves growth inhibition. This autoconditioning of the medium by yeasts is due to the formation of small amounts (0.01%, vol/vol) of acetaldehyde. The effect is duplicated precisely in fresh medium by the addition of acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde does not increase the yield of or accelerate ethanol production by the organism. Ethanol-induced modifications of membrane order in the plasma membranes, as measured by steady-state fluorescence anisotropy of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene, were not resolved by exogenously added acetaldehyde.

6178976|t|Oxygen intermediates are triggered early in the cytolytic pathway of human NK cells.
6178976|a|The mechanism of tumour cell destruction by natural killer (NK) cells or other lymphocytes is not understood. NK cells appear to represent a primitive anti-tumour surveillance system more analogous to macrophages than lymphocytes. Free oxygen radicals (O-2, OH) and H2O2 are thought to be involved in cell destruction by macrophages and therefore we looked for similar cytocidal intermediates of oxygen in NK cells. These highly reactive molecular species can easily be detected in the presence of luminol by the emission of light. We show here that highly enriched human NK cells respond to NK-sensitive but not NK-insensitive tumour cells with a rapid burst of oxygen metabolites as detected both by chemiluminescence and cytochrome c reduction. Agents which can prevent chemiluminescence and cytochrome c reduction, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced NK-mediated cytolysis and agents which increased chemiluminescence, such as interferon, also increased NK-mediated cytolysis. These results suggest that the production of oxygen species may be the earliest event to occur in the NK cell following tumour cell contact, and these products are involved in NK-mediated cytolysis.

17537988|t|Role of NF-kappaB in transcriptional regulation of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase by tumor necrosis factor-alpha.
17537988|a|Macrophages play an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory disease. Activation of these phagocytes induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1 and TNF-alpha and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide anion (O2*-). Recently, we found that TNF-alpha treatment of human monocytic cells (MonoMac1) and isolated human monocytes resulted in up-regulation of the NADPH oxidase gene, neutrophil cytosolic factor 2 (NCF2). These results suggested that TNF-alpha, produced by activated macrophages, could serve as an autocrine/paracrine regulator of the oxidase, resulting in increased and/or prolonged production of O2*-. To gain a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in NADPH oxidase regulation by TNF-alpha, we evaluated transcriptional regulation of oxidase genes in MonoMac1 cells and human monocytes. We show that TNF-alpha-treated cells have increased levels of mRNA and up-regulated expression of NADPH oxidase subunits p47(phox), p67(phox), and gp91(phox), as well as increased oxidase activity. Pharmacological inhibitors of NF-kappaB activation blocked TNF-alpha-induced up-regulation of NCF1, NCF2, and CYBB message, which correlated with a reduction in expression of the corresponding oxidase proteins and decreased O2*- production. These data demonstrate that the increase in and/or maintenance of O2*- production in TNF-alpha-treated MonoMac1 cells and monocytes are a result, in part, of transcriptional up-regulation of three essential NADPH oxidase genes via the NF-kappaB pathway. This novel finding supports a model, whereby TNF-alpha-dependent activation of NF-kappaB up-regulates phagocyte NADPH oxidase activity, leading to enhanced ROS production and further NF-kappaB activation, potentially contributing to sustained oxidant production in chronic inflammation.

24031672|t|"A comparison between sugar consumption and ethanol production in wort by immobilized Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, Saccharomyces Ludwigii and Saccharomyces Rouxii on Brewer'S Spent Grain".
24031672|a|The immobilization of Saccharomyces cerevisiae DSM 70424, Saccharomyces ludwigii DSM 3447 and Saccharomyces rouxii DSM 2531 on brewer's spent grain and then ethanol production and sugar consumption of these immobilized yeasts were investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the abilities of these three immobilized yeasts for producing alcohol for brewing at two temperatures (7 and 12 °C) using two different sugar levels (one at original level supplied in the brewery and one with 2.5% (w/v), added glucose to the wort). Increasing both parameters resulted in higher alcohol production by all the yeasts studied. At 7 °C and with original wort density the ethanol content at the end of fermentation was 2.7% (v/v) for S. cerevisiae, 1.7% for S. ludwigii and 2.0% for S. rouxii. After the addition of 2.5% (w/v) glucose at the same temperature (7 °C), the alcohol production was increased to 4.1, 2.8 and 4.1%, respectively. Similar improvements were observed when the fermentation was carried out at 12 °C with/without the addition of glucose to the wort. However, temperature indicated greater influence on S. ludwigii than did on S. rouxii and S. cerevisiae. The immobilization as carried out in this study impacted both S. ludwigii and S. rouxii in a way that they could consume maltose under certain conditions.

10052694|t|Direct high-performance liquid chromatography determination of propofol and its metabolite quinol with their glucuronide conjugates and preliminary pharmacokinetics in plasma and urine of man.
10052694|a|Propofol (P) is metabolized in humans by oxidation to 1,4-di-isopropylquinol (Q). P and Q are in turn conjugated with glucuronic acid to the respective glucuronides, propofol glucuronide (Pgluc), quinol-1-glucuronide (Q1G) and quinol-4-glucuronide (Q4G). Propofol and quinol with their glucuronide conjugates can be measured directly by gradient high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis without enzymic hydrolysis. The glucuronide conjugates were isolated by preparative HPLC from human urine samples. The glucuronides of P and Q were present in plasma and urine, P and Q were present in plasma, but not in urine. Quinol in plasma was present in the oxidised form, the quinone. Calibration curves of the respective glucuronides were constructed by enzymic deconjugation of isolated samples containing different concentrations of the glucuronides. The limit of quantitation of P and quinone in plasma are respectively 0.119 and 0.138 microg/ml. The limit of quantitation of the glucuronides in plasma are respectively: Pgluc 0.370 microg/ml, Q1G 1.02 microg/ml and Q4G 0.278 microg/ml. The corresponding values in urine are: Pgluc 0.264 microg/ml, Q1G 0.731 microg/ml and Q4G 0.199 microg/ml. A pharmacokinetic profile of P with its metabolites is shown, and some preliminary pharmacokinetic parameters of P and Q glucuronides are given.

7500362|t|Crystal structure of the catalytic subunit of human protein phosphatase 1 and its complex with tungstate.
7500362|a|Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is a serine/threonine protein phosphatase that is essential in regulating diverse cellular processes. Here we report the crystal structure of the catalytic subunit of human PP1 gamma 1 and its complex with tungstate at 2.5 A resolution. The anomalous scattering from tungstate was used in a multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion experiment to derive crystallographic phase information. The protein adopts a single domain with a novel fold, distinct from that of the protein tyrosine phosphatases. A di-nuclear ion centre consisting of Mn2+ and Fe2+ is situated at the catalytic site that binds the phosphate moiety of the substrate. Proton-induced X-ray emission spectroscopy was used to identify the nature of the ions bound to the enzyme. The structural data indicate that dephosphorylation is catalysed in a single step by a metal-activated water molecule. This contrasts with other phosphatases, including protein tyrosine phosphatases, acid and alkaline phosphatases which form phosphoryl-enzyme intermediates. The structure of PP1 provides insight into the molecular mechanism for substrate recognition, enzyme regulation and inhibition of this enzyme by toxins and tumour promoters and a basis for understanding the expanding family of related phosphatases which include PP2A and PP2B (calcineurin).

23106982|t|Role of the yeast multidrug transporter Qdr2 in cation homeostasis and the oxidative stress response.
23106982|a|We have identified QDR2 in a screening for genes able to confer tolerance to sodium and/or lithium stress upon overexpression. Qdr2 is a multidrug transporter of the major facilitator superfamily, originally described for its ability to transport the antimalarial drug quinidine and the herbicide barban. To identify its physiological substrate, we have screened for phenotypes dependent on QDR2 and found that Qdr2 is able to transport monovalent and divalent cations with poor selectivity, as shown by growth tests and the determination of internal cation content. Moreover, strains overexpressing or lacking QDR2 also exhibit phenotypes when reactive oxygen species- producing agents, such as hydrogen peroxide or menadione were added to the growth medium. We have also found that the presence of copper and hydrogen peroxide repress the expression of QDR2. In addition, the copper uptake of a qdr2 mutant strain is similar to a wild type, but the extrusion is clearly impaired. Based on our results, we propose that free divalent copper is the main physiological substrate of Qdr2. As copper is a substrate for several redox reactions that occur within the cytoplasm, its function in copper homeostasis explains its role in the oxidative stress response.

12653342|t|Treatment of insulin resistance in uremia.
12653342|a|Insulin resistance is a characteristic feature of uremia. As long as the hyperinsulinemia adequate to overcome the insulin resistance, glucose tolerance remains normal. In patients destined to develop type 2 diabetes, the beta cell compensatory response declines, and relative, or absolute, insulin deficiency develops. At this point glucose intolerance and eventually frank type 2 diabetes occur. Insulin resistance and concomitant hyperinsulinemia are present irrespective of the type of renal disease. Several studies have confirmed that hemodialysis (HD) treatment significantly improves insulin resistance. Both CAPD and CCPD are shown to improve insulin resistance in uremic patients. Comparing the effect of PD and HD treatment, it was found that the CCPD group has significantly higher insulin sensitivity than the HD group with the CAPD group similar to HD. Treatment of calcium and phosphate disturbances, including vitamin D therapy, significantly reduces insulin resistance in uremia. Treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) is an efficient way to increase hematocrit, to reverse cardiovascular problems and to improve insulin sensitivity. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to improve insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia and glucose intolerance in uremic patients. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), the new insulin-sensitizing drugs, provide the proof that pharmacologic treatment of insulin resistance can be of enormous clinical benefit. The great potential of insulin resistance therapy illuminated by the TZDs will continue to catalyze research in this area directed toward the discovery of new insulin-sensitizing agents that work through other mechanisms.

26324278|t|In vivo curative and protective potential of orally administered 5-aminolevulinic acid plus ferrous ion against malaria.
26324278|a|5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is a naturally occurring amino acid present in diverse organisms and a precursor of heme biosynthesis. ALA is commercially available as a component of cosmetics, dietary supplements, and pharmaceuticals for cancer diagnosis and therapy. Recent reports demonstrated that the combination of ALA and ferrous ion (Fe(2+)) inhibits the in vitro growth of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. To further explore the potential application of ALA and ferrous ion as a combined antimalarial drug for treatment of human malaria, we conducted an in vivo efficacy evaluation. Female C57BL/6J mice were infected with the lethal strain of rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium yoelii 17XL and orally administered ALA plus sodium ferrous citrate (ALA/SFC) as a once-daily treatment. Parasitemia was monitored in the infected mice, and elimination of the parasites was confirmed using diagnostic PCR. Treatment of P. yoelii 17XL-infected mice with ALA/SFC provided curative efficacy in 60% of the mice treated with ALA/SFC at 600/300 mg/kg of body weight; no mice survived when treated with vehicle alone. Interestingly, the cured mice were protected from homologous rechallenge, even when reinfection was attempted more than 230 days after the initial recovery, indicating long-lasting resistance to reinfection with the same parasite. Moreover, parasite-specific antibodies against reported vaccine candidate antigens were found and persisted in the sera of the cured mice. These findings provide clear evidence that ALA/SFC is effective in an experimental animal model of malaria and may facilitate the development of a new class of antimalarial drug.

11006093|t|Molecular cloning and genomic organization of the mouse AE2 anion exchanger gene.
11006093|a|The molecular organization of the AE2 (SLC4A2) gene, a member of the multigene family encoding sodium-independent chloride/bicarbonate anion exchangers, has previously been described in both humans and rats. In these two species, AE2 shows alternate promoter usages and tissue-specific expression of isoforms in a similar, but not identical, fashion. Here we report the molecular cloning and organization of the entire mouse AE2 gene. The gene consists of 23 exons and 22 introns and spans about 17 kb. Moreover, it drives transcription of N-terminal truncated isoforms from alternate promoter sequences in a way analogous to that described for rat and/or human orthologs. Thus, sequences within intron 2 function as overlapping alternate promoters for truncated isoforms AE2b(1) and AE2b(2), and sequences of intron 5 drive transcription of isoforms AE2c(1) and AE2c(2). Each of these variants has a specific alternative first exon, while remaining exons are common to the complete form of the message AE2a, the diversity at 5' leading to different N-termini in corresponding encoded proteins. As expected, mouse AE2 promoter sequences and the patterns of tissue expression of AE2 isoforms resemble rat counterparts more closely than human ones.

8441175|t|Anomalously slow mobility of fluorescent lipid probes in the plasma membrane of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
8441175|a|We measured the lateral mobility of two fluorescent lipid probes dioctadecylindocarbocyanine (diI) and tetramethyl rhodamine phosphatidylethanolamine (R-PE) in the plasma membranes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ino1 and opi3 spheroplasts. These are well-characterized strains with mutations in the inositol and phosphatidylcholine biosynthetic pathways. Membrane phospholipid composition was altered by growing these mutants in the presence or absence of inositol and choline. Lateral mobility was measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Microscopic fluorescence polarization employing CCD digital imaging produced an ordered orientation distribution of the lipid probe diI, confirming that at least one of the probes was largely incorporated into the bilayer membrane. Our results demonstrated anomalously slow mobility of both lipid probes for both mutants, regardless of whether the lipid composition was near normal or dramatically altered in relative composition of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine. Trypsinization of the spheroplasts to remove surface proteins resulted in markedly increased lateral mobility. However, even in trypsinized spheroplasts, mobility was still somewhat lower than the mobility observed in the membrane of mammalian cells, such as rat smooth muscle culture cells tested here for comparison.

27252708|t|GintAMT3 - a Low-Affinity Ammonium Transporter of the Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Rhizophagus irregularis.
27252708|a|Nutrient acquisition and transfer are essential steps in the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis, which is formed by the majority of land plants. Mineral nutrients are taken up by AM fungi from the soil and transferred to the plant partner. Within the cortical plant root cells the fungal hyphae form tree-like structures (arbuscules) where the nutrients are released to the plant-fungal interface, i.e., to the periarbuscular space, before being taken up by the plant. In exchange, the AM fungi receive carbohydrates from the plant host. Besides the well-studied uptake of phosphorus (P), the uptake and transfer of nitrogen (N) plays a crucial role in this mutualistic interaction. In the AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis (formerly called Glomus intraradices), two ammonium transporters (AMT) were previously described, namely GintAMT1 and GintAMT2. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a newly identified R. irregularis AMT, GintAMT3. Phylogenetic analyses revealed high sequence similarity to previously identified AM fungal AMTs and a clear separation from other fungal AMTs. Topological analysis indicated GintAMT3 to be a membrane bound pore forming protein, and GFP tagging showed it to be highly expressed in the intraradical mycelium of a fully established AM symbiosis. Expression of GintAMT3 in yeast successfully complemented the yeast AMT triple deletion mutant (MATa ura3 mep1Δ mep2Δ::LEU2 mep3Δ::KanMX2). GintAMT3 is characterized as a low affinity transport system with an apparent Km of 1.8 mM and a V max of 240 nmol(-1) min(-1) 10(8) cells(-1), which is regulated by substrate concentration and carbon supply.

8921512|t|The photomutagenicity of fluoroquinolones in tests for gene mutation, chromosomal aberration, gene conversion and DNA breakage (Comet assay).
8921512|a|The ability of fluoroquinolones to cause light-induced adverse effects has been established in experimental studies and clinical observations. The formation of active oxygen species appears to be responsible for this activity. Photomutagenicity tests with bacterial, lower eukaryotic and mammalian cells were performed with three fluoroquinolones (Fleroxacin, Ciprofloxacin and Lomefloxacin). After concomitant irradiation with simulated solar light (with a reduced UVB component), weak increases in the number of revertants were observed in Salmonella typhimurium TA104 and TA100. No photomutagenic activity was detected in Saccharomyces cerevisiae D7. In the chromosomal aberration (CA) test with Chinese hamster V79 cells the number of aberrant metaphases was markedly increased. In the Comet assay with mouse lymphoma cells, evidence of extensive DNA breakage was obtained. All three compounds showed similar potencies in the Comet and Ames assays while there was a clear gradation of potencies in the CA assay (Lomefloxacin > Fleroxacin > Ciprofloxacin), which conformed with reports on the relative potencies regarding phototoxicity. The oxygen radical scavengers catalase, superoxide dismutase and N, N'-dimethylurea modulated the photoclastogenicity and phototoxicity but had no influence on the effects in the Comet and Ames tests. It thus appears that different kinds of mechanism are responsible for toxicity and clastogenicity on the one side and DNA breakage and gene mutation on the other side. Pre-irradiation of the test articles did not lead to enhanced genotoxicity, indicating the involvement of very short lived genotoxic agents. The results endorse the advice to avoid excessive light exposure during antibiotic therapy with fluoroquinolones.

15483081|t|Resting metabolic rate and respiratory quotient in human longevity.
15483081|a|Significant changes in body composition, body fat distribution, and resting metabolic rate (RMR) occur with aging. Interestingly, studies on human longevity pointed out that long-lived subjects are less prone to the anthropometrics and metabolic derangement normally observed in the elderly. Indeed, the relationship between energy expenditure and longevity has been poorly investigated. Thus, energy expenditure parameters of 28 long-lived subjects were assessed and compared with those of 26 adults and 27 younger elderly. All subjects enrolled were female. In the whole population, RMR was negatively correlated with age (P < 0.05), waist to hip ratio (WHR) (P < 0.001), fat mass (P < 0.001), and percent body fat (P < 0.03); respiratory quotient (Rq) displayed an age-related decrease (P < 0.001) and was negatively correlated with WHR (P < 0.001) and fat-free mass (FFM) (P < 0.006). In multivariate analysis, both RMR and Rq had FFM, WHR, but not body mass index as significant and independent determinants. Splitting the whole study group into subgroups according to age, long-lived subjects had oxygen volume, carbon dioxide volume, and Rq significantly higher than aged subjects but lower than adult subjects. In addition, long-lived subjects had total volume of expired air and RMR greater than aged subjects but not different from ones found in adults. In long-lived subjects, Rq was negatively correlated with percent body fat (P < 0.02), plasma glucose (P < 0.05), free fatty acid (P < 0.05), and WHR (P < 0.05), whereas RMR was negatively correlated with WHR (P < 0.05). No significant associations of RMR and Rq with FFM were found. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that human longevity seems protected toward an age-related decline. It is likely that the lack of the anthropometrics derangement may preserve long-lived subjects from the age-related decrease in energy metabolism.

9112126|t|Addition of both platelets and thrombin in combination accelerates tumor cells to adhere to endothelial cells in vitro.
9112126|a|Platelets and coagulation are involved in the pathogenesis of blood-borne metastases. The aim of this study is to obtain more information about the mechanisms involved in the initial adhesion of tumor cells to endothelial cells. In short term experiments with tumor cells, suspended in the medium of cultured endothelial cells, we tested whether addition of both platelets and thrombin cause more tumor cell adhesion to endothelial cells, than when either platelets or thrombin are acting alone. HeLa cells or HT29 cells, prelabeled with radioactive 51Cr, human platelets, and thrombin were added to human endothelial cell cultures. Following 15 min of shaking at 37 degrees C, the percentage of tumor cell adhesion was calculated. The percentages of adhering tumor cells with the presence of both platelets and thrombin were greatly increased compared to controls. Addition of hirudin 2 min before thrombin lowered the adhesion percentage of tumor cells. Hirudin added immediately before and 2 min after thrombin gave only minor effects. When the endothelium was treated with superoxide dismutase, catalase, and mannitol, the adhesion of tumor cells was lowered with catalase and superoxide dismutase. The cause of tumor cell-endothelial cell interaction is probably complex. Our results show that activated platelets enhance the tumor cell adhesion, and that generation of active oxygen species may be important in the initial phase of the interaction.

38939|t|Effect of intravenous sodium lactate on renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate in man.
38939|a|1. The effects of sodium DL-lactate and sodium chloride (2.5 mg/kg as 865 mmol/l solutions given by intravenous infusion over 20 min) on the renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate have been compared in five normal adults. 2. Sodium lactate produced a marked but transient increase in urinary phosphate excretion due to a reduction in net renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate; the mean value of the maximum rate of renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate/unit of glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR) decreased from 1.14 to 0.82 mmol/l. 3. This effect was not due simply to expansion of the volume of the extracellular fluid, since the reduction in TmP/GFR after sodium chloride infusion was less marked, nor did it seem to be due entirely to alkalinization of the urine since the maximum increase in urinary pH occurred 20--40 min after the maximum decrease in TmP/GFR.

2351715|t|ATP and ADP in human pre-embryos.
2351715|a|Spare human oocytes and pre-embryos from an in-vitro fertilization (IVF) programme were individually analysed for ATP and ADP content using a bioluminescence method employing the firefly luciferin-luciferase reaction. The ATP content of oocytes that failed to fertilize in vitro was 1.71 +/- 0.28 pmol (n = 10), pronuclear stage ova 1.93 +/- 0.08 (n = 6), 2-cell stage 1.78 +/- 0.20 (n = 7), 4-cell stage 1.73 +/- 0.15 (n = 6), 6-8 cell stage 2.76 +/- 0.53 (n = 8), morula stage 2.36 +/- 0.68 (n = 8), early blastocyst stage 2.08 +/- 0.25 (n = 7) and expanded blastocyst stage 2.26 +/- 0.15 (n = 3) pmol. The ADP content of these pre-embryos was low in all stages with a small increment in the 2-4 cell stages and the blastocyst stage. This gave an elevated ATP/ADP ratio (range 19-92) indicating a good energy status. The sensitive luciferin-luciferase assay may be a tool for studying the energy status of spare oocytes and pre-embryos under different incubation conditions in human IVF programmes.

3262684|t|C1q induces chemotaxis and K+ conductance activation coupled to increased cytosolic Ca2+ in mouse fibroblasts.
3262684|a|Cultured mouse fibroblasts (L cells) respond to whole C with a slow hyperpolarization. Among the C components tested, C1q was found to be most effective. In contrast, the cell did not respond to C1, in which the collagen-like region of the C1q molecule is masked. The C1q-induced hyperpolarizing response was inhibited by collagen or C1q-specific antisera. Human diploid skin fibroblasts (Flow 1,000 cells) also exhibited similar membrane potential changes in response to whole C or C1q. After repeated applications of C1q, the cell membrane became unresponsive (desensitized). The treatment of L cells with pronase E inhibited the C1q-induced response, whereas the response to ATP, which is known to interact to its own receptor, was still preserved. The reversal potential of C responses was close to the K+ equilibrium potential. The hyperpolarizing response was inhibited by a blocker of Ca2+-activated K+ channels in fibroblasts (quinine), by deprivation of extracellular Ca2+ or by a Ca2+ channel blocker (nifedipine). By means of Ca2+-selective microelectrodes, the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration was found to increase from 126 to 206 nM upon stimulation of L cells with C1q. Using an agarose-well method, L cells were observed to migrate predominantly toward C1q or whole C. It is concluded that the fibroblasts have the C1q receptor sensitive to pronase E and that activation of C1q receptors gives rise to Ca2+ influx, triggering an increase in the cytosolic free Ca2+ ions, which in turn induces a hyperpolarizing response as a result of the stimulation of Ca2+-activated K+ channels and initiates chemotaxis to C1q.

26555751|t|Crystal Structure Analysis of Wild Type and Fast Hydrolyzing Mutant of EhRabX3, a Tandem Ras Superfamily GTPase from Entamoeba histolytica.
26555751|a|The enteric protozoan parasite, Entamoeba histolytica, is the causative agent of amoebic dysentery, liver abscess and colitis in human. Vesicular trafficking plays a key role in the survival and virulence of the protozoan and is regulated by various Rab GTPases. EhRabX3 is a catalytically inefficient amoebic Rab protein, which is unique among the eukaryotic Ras superfamily by virtue of its tandem domain organization. Here, we report the crystal structures of GDP-bound fast hydrolyzing mutant (V71A/K73Q) and GTP-bound wild type EhRabX3 at 3.1 and 2.8Å resolutions, respectively. Though both G-domains possess "phosphate binding loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases fold", only the N-terminal domain binds to guanine nucleotide. The relative orientation of the N-terminal domain and C-terminal domain is stabilized by numerous inter-domain interactions. Compared to other Ras superfamily members, both the GTPase domains displayed large deviation in switch II perhaps due to non-conservative substitutions in this region. As a result, entire switch II is restructured and moved away from the nucleotide binding pocket, providing a rationale for the diminished GTPase activity of EhRabX3. The N-terminal GTPase domain possesses unusually large number of cysteine residues. X-ray crystal structure of the fast hydrolyzing mutant of EhRabX3 revealed that C39 and C163 formed an intra-molecular disulfide bond. Subsequent mutational and biochemical studies suggest that C39 and C163 are critical for maintaining the structural integrity and function of EhRabX3. Structure-guided functional investigation of cysteine mutants could provide the physiological implications of the disulfide bond and could allow us to design potential inhibitors for the better treatment of intestinal amebiasis.

10348816|t|Helicobacter pylori-dependent ceramide production may mediate increased interleukin 8 expression in human gastric cancer cell lines.
10348816|a|BACKGROUND & AIMS: Helicobacter pylori adheres to gastric epithelial cells, activates nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), and stimulates interleukin (IL)-8 production, but the responsible molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Because several studies have shown that sphingolipids are involved in a number of signaling pathways, including NF-kappaB activation, we investigated the possible role of sphingolipids in the regulation of IL-8 expression in Kato III and AGS cells. METHODS: IL-8 production in the conditioned media was quantified by enzyme immunoassay. Induction of messenger RNA (mRNA) was assessed by Northern blot analysis. Activation and binding activity of transcription factors were examined by luciferase assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay, respectively. Intracellular levels of ceramide were quantified by diacylglycerol kinase assay. RESULTS: A cell-permeable ceramide analogue (C2-ceramide) increased IL-8 expression with comparable mRNA induction. This effect was mimicked by sphingomyelinase, but not by phospholipase A2 or phospholipase C. C2-ceramide induced IL-8 gene transcription mainly through activation of NF-kappaB because mutation of the NF-kappaB-binding site completely abrogated the induction of luciferase activity. Direct contact of live H. pylori with epithelial cells increased the intracellular concentration of ceramide. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest a novel role of the sphingomyelin-ceramide pathway, at least in part through NF-kappaB, in IL-8 production induced by H. pylori infection in gastric epithelial cells.

23809710|t|A carbon responsive G-protein coupled receptor modulates broad developmental and genetic networks in the entomopathogenic fungus, Beauveria bassiana.
23809710|a|In fungi, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) link ligand/nutrient sensing to growth, mating, developmental/life-stage activation and pathogenesis. A GPCR was characterized from the entomopathogenic fungus, Beauveria bassiana (BbGPCR3), which links nutrient sensing to stress response and development. ΔBbGPCR3 mutants grew slower on various carbohydrates and displayed increased sensitivity to osmotic, oxidative and cell wall stresses. Gene expression profiling revealed a set of heat-shock and antioxidant factors that failed to be induced under oxidative stress and aberrant regulation of compatible solute-forming enzymes and cell wall biosynthesis/remodelling proteins in ΔBbGPCR3 after osmotic stress. Glucose-specific developmental defects included reduced (> 90%) conidiation and reduced dimorphic transition to the production of yeast-like blastospores, effects suppressed in media containing trehalose or glycerol, but not by addition of cyclic AMP. Insect bioassays revealed reduced virulence in topical assays but no effect in intrahaemoceol injection assays, indicating that BbGPCR3 was important in sensing signals during the initial interaction with the host but dispensable for post-penetration events. Comparative gene expression profiling of ΔBbGPCR3 mutants grown in glucose media compared with wild-type/glucose and ΔBbGPCR3/trehalose grown cells revealed sets of genes misregulated and recovered, respectively. These data link BbGPCR3 to broad developmental and genetic networks that include the major MAP kinase pathways.

2844449|t|The human leucocyte sodium pump in Cushing's syndrome.
2844449|a|Because corticosteroids have important effects on sodium homeostasis, we studied leucocyte 22Na efflux in patients with Cushing's syndrome. The ouabain-sensitive 22Na+ efflux rate constant was raised in Cushing's syndrome (mean +/- SD 2.84 +/- 0.32 vs 2.35 +/- 0.53/h, P less than 0.001, n = 15). This efflux rate constant correlated with the urinary free cortisol (rs = 0.61, P less than 0.02), but less significantly with the 0900 h plasma cortisol (rs = 0.46, P less than 0.08). There was no correlation with the supine plasma aldosterone. Intracellular sodium content was significantly lower in Cushing's syndrome (21.1 +/- 4.6 vs 27.8 +/- 9.5 mmol/kg dry weight, P less than 0.01), with a raised intracellular potassium to sodium content ratio (16.1 +/- 3.3 vs 12.9 +/- 3.6, P less than 0.01). After treatment of the Cushing's syndrome by trans-sphenoidal adenomectomy or adrenalectomy, these defects in cellular sodium balance were corrected. Thus, the distribution of sodium between intra- and extracellular fluid may be affected by adrenal corticosteroids via an action on the sodium pump.

3591582|t|[Male infertility with chromosomal abnormalities. II. XX-male syndrome].
3591582|a|We report two cases of the XX-male syndrome, and review the literature. The first case was a 31-year-old married man, a welder, complaining of infertility. His height was 158 cm, weight 82 kg and distance of extended hand 155 cm. The external genitalia showed a normal male type, but bilateral small testes and gynecomastia were noticed. The second case was a 32-year-old married man, a shopkeeper, complaining of infertility. His height was 165 cm, weight 60 kg and distance of extended hand 167 cm. No gynecomastia was noted. The external genitalia showed a normal male type, but bilateral small testes were noticed. In each case, azoospermia was identified in semen analysis. Urethrography revealed the prostatic utricle in the second case. The testicular biopsy specimens revealed hyalinization of seminiferous tubules and proliferation of Leydig cells. X chromatin was positive in buccal smears, and Y chromatin negative in cultured lymphocytes. Chromosomal analysis showed 46, XX karyotype in the first case and 46, XXp+ in the second case. H-Y antigen was positive in each case. Basal serum levels of LH and FSH were moderately elevated and the serum testosterone level was low. Serum levels of PRL, TSH, estradiol, GH, T3 and T4 were normal. An impaired response by testicular Leydig cells to hCG was observed. The LH and FSH responses to LH-RH were almost normal. Clomiphene citrate administration resulted in a decrease in the serum testosterone and gonadotropins levels. These results indicate hypergonadotropic hypogonadism secondary to testicular failure in both XX-males. Twenty-six cases of the XX-male syndrome have been cited in the Japanese literature.

10739801|t|Severe ectopic calcification of the intestinal wall in a patient on long-term continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis therapy.
10739801|a|We report autopsy findings of a 69-year-old man on long-term CAPD therapy for 13 years who showed linear peritoneal calcification. Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) was started in 1982. He has been administered excessive amounts of vitamin D(3) derivatives (VitD) (2.0 to 2.5 microg daily) and calcium carbonate (4 g daily) for secondary hyperparathyroidism since initiation of CAPD. In May 1995, his intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level increased over 1,000 pg/mL. Immediately after VitD was changed from pill to liquid, the dose was increased to 5 microg daily. Although the serum calcium level remained between 4.5 and 4.9 mEq/L, and serum phosphate level was 5.0 to 7.2 mg/dL, plain abdominal radiography and computed tomography showed continuous calcification along the intestinal wall in October 1995. In spite of the continuation of CAPD therapy, he remained asymptomatic until he died of congestive heart failure in January 1997. He experienced eight episodes of peritonitis during his clinical course. Autopsy showed that numerous calcified plaques were present on the submucosal portion between the thickened serosa and the longitudinal layer of the muscularis externa. The remainder of the subserosa was fibrotic, and the small arteries had markedly thickened intima and severely narrowed lumina.

1850207|t|Tumor necrosis factor-alpha increases Mn-SOD expression: protection against oxidant injury.
1850207|a|Antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, are important for protecting the lung against O2 injury. Manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) is a superoxide anion (O2-.) scavenger located in the mitochondria, a primary site of O2-. production during hyperoxia. We studied the effects of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), a macrophage-derived cytokine, on Mn-SOD expression in human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells. TNF-alpha significantly increased Mn-SOD activity and mRNA in a dose-and time-dependent manner. Mn-SOD activity was increased 3-fold and mRNA 20-fold after a 48-h incubation with TNF-alpha (25 ng/ml). To examine the mechanism of this increase, cells were incubated for 48 h with TNF-alpha (25 ng/ml) with or without cycloheximide (10 microns) or actinomycin D (10 micrograms/ml). Actinomycin D blocked the induction of Mn-SOD mRNA by TNF-alpha, but cycloheximide did not. These findings suggest that the effect of TNF-alpha requires gene transcription but not synthesis of new protein intermediates. To test the hypothesis that increased Mn-SOD protects against oxidative injury, pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells were incubated in TNF-alpha (25 ng/ml) for 48 h and then exposed to paraquat (PQ+), an intracellular O2-. generator. Cells pretreated with TNF-alpha had significantly improved survival in PQ+ compared with controls. At the LD50 (6 microns) for control cells, 95% of TNF-alpha-treated cells survived, 85% at the LD75 (10 microns), and 77% at the LD90 (14 microns). Our results suggest that the induction of Mn-SOD by TNF-alpha in pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells is pretranslationally mediated and that increasing Mn-SOD activity with TNF-alpha confers protection against O2 radicals.

16919894|t|Effect of advanced glycation end-products on cell proliferation and cell death.
16919894|a|The effect of advanced glycation end products (AGE-s) was studied on the proliferation and cell death of human skin fibroblasts in culture. Several AGE-products were prepared from proteins, a peptide and amino acids, using Glucose or Fructose, with or without Fe2+. The AGE preparations increased cell death at the 7th day, after only 72 hours of incubation. Some of these glycation products modified also proliferation. This effect of AGE-s was even maintained without these products in fresh medium for a second period of incubation up to 10 days from the start of the experiment. In order to explore the role of AGE-receptors, especially of AGE-receptor and of growth factor receptors (fibroblast and epidermal growth factors receptors), antibodies to these receptors were added to cell cultures and their effect on both cell death and proliferation were determined as for the AGE-s. These anti-receptor antibodies imitated to some extent the results obtained with AGE-s, producing increase of cell death and proliferation, followed above a certain concentration of antibodies by a decrease and a new increase or plateau. This might correspond to the internalization of the receptors followed by a re-expression on the cell membrane. The role of receptor-mediated Reactive Oxygen Species-production was also explored using scavengers: N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), L-Carnosine, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Catalase. Several of these scavengers decreased cell death, suggesting that Reactive Oxygen Species-production is partially involved in the observed phenomena.

12744683|t|The effect of SO2 on the production of ethanol, acetaldehyde, organic acids, and flavor volatiles during industrial cider fermentation.
12744683|a|SO(2) is widely used in cider fermentation but also in other alcoholic beverages such as wine. Although the authorized limit is 200 ppm total SO(2), the International Organizations recommend its total elimination or at least reduction due to health concerns. Addition of SO(2) to apple juice at levels frequently used in industrial cidermaking (100 mg/L) induced significantly higher acetaldehyde production by yeast than that obtained without SO(2). Although the practical implications of acetaldehyde evolution under cidermaking conditions has been overcome by research and few data are available, this compound reached levels in two 2000 L bioreactors that may have prevented the occurrence of simultaneous alcoholic and malolactic fermentation. It was observed that malolactic fermentation had a positive effect promoting reduction of acetaldehyde levels in cider fermented with juice, SO(2)-treated or not. The addition of SO(2) clearly delayed malolactic fermentation comparing to the control, affecting not the onset of the malolactic fermentation but the rate of malic acid degradation. This compound, however, had a stimulatory effect on alcoholic fermentation.

236510|t|Pyruvate kinase from human skeletal muscle.
236510|a|A simple method is described for the isolation of crystalline pyruvate kinase from human skeletal muscle. The enzyme was purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation, heat treatment and crystallization. Two crystal forms of pyruvate kinase differing in solubility but not in specific activity were found. The homogenous enzyme preparations in triethanolamine buffer, pH 7.6 reveal at 25 degrees a specific activity of 245 U per mg protein, and of 340 U/mg in potassium phosphate buffer (50 mM). The enzyme is activated by inorganic phosphate and fructosediphosphate to the same extent, and inhibited non competetively by ammonium ion. The molecular weight as measured by gel filtration is 220,000 daltons and the enzyme molecule is composed of 4 subunits.

10650940|t|Iodide excess induces apoptosis in thyroid cells through a p53-independent mechanism involving oxidative stress.
10650940|a|Thyroid toxicity of iodide excess has been demonstrated in animals fed with an iodide-rich diet; in vitro iodide is cytotoxic, inhibits cell growth, and induces morphological changes in thyroid cells of some species. In this study, we investigated the effect of iodide excess in an immortalized thyroid cell line (TAD-2) in primary cultures of human thyroid cells and in cells of nonthyroid origin. Iodide displayed a dose-dependent cytotoxicity in both TAD-2 and primary thyroid cells, although at different concentrations, whereas it had no effect on cells of nonthyroid origin. Thyroid cells treated with iodide excess underwent apoptosis, as evidenced by morphological changes, plasma membrane phosphatidylserine exposure, and DNA fragmentation. Apoptosis was unaffected by protein synthesis inhibition, whereas inhibition of peroxidase enzymatic activity by propylthiouracil completely blocked iodide cytotoxicity. During KI treatment, reactive oxygen species were produced, and lipid peroxide levels increased markedly. Inhibition of endogenous p53 activity did not affect the sensitivity of TAD-2 cells to iodide, and Western blot analysis demonstrated that p53, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bax protein expression did not change when cells were treated with iodide. These data indicate that excess molecular iodide, generated by oxidation of ionic iodine by endogenous peroxidases, induces apoptosis in thyroid cells through a mechanism involving generation of free radicals. This type of apoptosis is p53 independent, does not require protein synthesis, and is not induced by modulation of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, or Bax protein expression.

12851118|t|Benzo[a]pyrene diones are produced by photochemical and enzymatic oxidation and induce concentration-dependent decreases in the proliferative state of human pulmonary epithelial cells.
12851118|a|Organic components within mixtures of combustion-derived materials may play an important role in the correlation between air pollution and adverse cardio/respiratory health. One class of these organic components, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), has been shown to produce a wide variety of adverse health effects. An air toxic and a model PAH, benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), is a component of combustion-derived particulate matter (PM). Although most biological effects associated with BaP have been attributed to the cytochrome P-450 derived BaP 7,8-diol 9,10-epoxide, many other BaP oxidation products are formed in atmospheric and biological reactions and may contribute to PAH-induced adverse health effects. In an ambient environment, BaP and other PAHs undergo oxidation in the presence of ultraviolet light, O(2), O(3), NO(2), or OH(*). Biological peroxidase- and P-450 mediated conversion of BaP produces an extensive metabolic profile of BaP oxidation products that significantly outnumber the 7,8-diol/diol epoxide. The data herein show that in addition to near-ultraviolet light and P-450 isozymes, lactoperoxidase (airway peroxidase) converted BaP into a mixture of three diones, the 1,6-, 3,6-, and 6,12-BaP dione (BPD). In addition, it was found that low concentrations of BPDs induced a concentration-dependent decrease in the proliferation state of human pulmonary epithelial cells in vitro. Nanomolar concentrations of BPDs mediated cell growth inhibition, which was partially reversed by co-incubation with N-acetyl-L-cysteine and ascorbate. BPDs induced the formation of reactive oxygen species as measured by the fluorophore 2,7-dichloro-fluorescein. Together, these results may indicate a role for PAH oxidation products (PAH diones) in the adverse health effects associated with combustion-derived PM and semivolatile organic compounds.

28677777|t|Suppression of SIRT6 by miR-33a facilitates tumor growth of glioma through apoptosis and oxidative stress resistance.
28677777|a|microRNA-33a (miR-33a) belongs to the miR-33 family that is implicated in the progression of various types of cancers. Aberrant expression of miR-33a has been detected in several human cancers, and has been shown to regulate the migration and invasion as well as proliferation and apoptosis of tumor cells. However, the clinical significance and precise mechanisms underlying the dysfunction of miR-33a in glioma have not been well investigated in previous studies. In this study, overexpression of miR-33a was observed in clinical glioma specimens and cell lines. Clinicopathological detection revealed that miR-33a highly expressing patients showed large tumor sized and advanced World Health Organization (WHO) grade as well as reduced overall survival. Furthermore, the results of in vitro experiments confirmed that loss of miR-33a resulted in reduced proliferation and enhanced apoptosis in U251 cells, while miR-33a restoration showed opposite effects in U87 cells. Further studies indicated that miR-33a knockdown restrained tumor growth of glioma in vivo. miR-33a negatively regulated the expression of sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) at both mRNA and protein levels via targeting the 3'UTR of SIRT6 mRNA. SIRT6 was underexpressed and inversely correlated with miR-33a expression in the glioma tissues. Mechanistically, SIRT6 overexpression increased the levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) while it reduced cell survival under H2O2 treatment. In addition, SIRT6 restoration led to apoptosis with alterative expression of Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-8, and inhibition of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway in glioma. Thus, our studies demonstrated that the deregulation of miR-33a may promote tumor development in human glioma by regulating the expression of its target gene, SIRT6.

17726074|t|Growth hormone treatment improves markers of systemic nitric oxide bioavailability via insulin-like growth factor-I.
17726074|a|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Impaired nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and low levels of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) are correlated to an increased risk for development of cardiovascular diseases. We investigated whether improved systemic NO bioavailability and increased levels of EPC after GH treatment are related and mediated by the IGF-I. DESIGN, PATIENTS, AND RESULTS: Healthy middle-aged volunteers (n = 16) were treated for 10 d with recombinant human GH. Before and after GH treatment, we analyzed markers of NO bioavailability and EPC levels. GH treatment was responded by significant increases in plasma IGF-I levels. Urinary cGMP levels were increased and diastolic blood pressure reduced after GH treatment (P < 0.05). Likewise, plasma nitrate and nitrite levels were increased, whereas the NO synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine was reduced. Correspondingly, IGF-I treatment increased expression of the asymmetric dimethylarginine-metabolizing enzyme dimethylarginie dimethylaminohydrolase-1 and dimethylarginie dimethylaminohydrolase-2 in cultured human endothelial cells. IGF-I levels correlated with cGMP concentrations (r = 0.51; P < 0.05). EPC numbers were increased after GH treatment and correlated with markers for NO bioavailability. These findings were also observed in mice treated with GH for 7 d. GH treatment additionally increased aortic endothelial NO synthase expression of mice. Importantly, blocking of the IGF-I receptor in vivo abolished the GH-mediated effects on markers of increased NO bioavailability. CONCLUSIONS: GH treatment induced markers of increased NO bioavailability and enhanced circulating EPC numbers in healthy volunteers. Animal data demonstrate increased NO availability to be mediated via an increase in IGF-I plasma levels. Thus, GH treatment enhances systemic NO bioavailability via IGF-I and may be beneficial in certain cardiovascular diseases.

25721615|t|Osteomalacia and Fanconi's syndrome caused by long-term low-dose adefovir dipivoxil.
25721615|a|WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) is recommended for patients infected with lamivudine-refractory hepatitis B virus (HBV). We report a case of low-dose ADV-induced hypophosphatemic osteomalacia that initially presented as diffuse musculoskeletal pain. CASE SUMMARY: A 59-year-old Chinese man reported an 18-month history of severe chest wall pain and multiple bone pain during the previous 4 months with no antecedent trauma. There was no clinical evidence of an infectious, inflammatory or malignant process. Medical history showed that the patient had a history of chronic hepatitis B infection, and receiving lamivudine at a daily dose of 100 mg for 70 months. Lamivudine was changed to adefovir (10 mg/day) for the past 42 months. His serum inorganic phosphorus concentration was significantly low (0·4 mmol/l; 0·81-1·5 mmol/L), and the result of a urine routine test was abnormal. Combined with unbearable bone pain, spontaneous fractures, changes in laboratory markers and the result of ECT and other radiographic findings, the diagnosis of Fanconi's syndrome with osteomalacia was established. Dramatic clinical, laboratory and imaging improvement was observed after ADV discontinuation. WHATS IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: This case indicates that Fanconi's syndrome with osteomalacia can be acquired by a chronic hepatitis B patient taking ADV at a conventional dosage of 10 mg/day. Therefore, patients with HBV treated with long-term ADV should be regularly monitored for renal function, serum calcium and serum phosphate. Urine testing for ion concentration should also be undertaken.

17032007|t|Production and characterization of human extracellular superoxide dismutase in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris.
17032007|a|Reactive oxygen species are associated with various diseases including cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, and pulmonary diseases. Extracellular superoxide dismutase (ECSOD) is an antioxidant enzyme secreted by cells to prevent overproduction of reactive oxygen species. We expressed an ECSOD gene isolated from a human aortic smooth muscle cDNA library in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. A synthetic secretion cassette was constructed with the inducible promoter of the alcohol oxidase 1 gene (AOX1) and the yeast alpha-mating factor signal peptide. As much as 25% of the total protein was ECSOD in some transformants grown under inducing conditions. After 36 h of methanol induction, ECSOD was exported into the culture medium at a concentration of approximately 440 mg/L with an antioxidative activity of 760 +/- 20 U/mg ECSOD. Transformed yeast cells were more resistant to heat shock and H(2)O(2) oxidative stress, indicating that the human ECSOD expressed by P. pastoris had multiple biological functions. Our data suggest that the methylotrophic yeast inducible system is suitable for large-scale production of enzymatically active human ECSOD.

6337128|t|Yeast mutant defective in phosphatidylcholine synthesis.
6337128|a|The Saccharomyces cerevisiae opi3-3 mutant was shown to be defective in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine via methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine. The opi3-3 mutant was isolated on the basis of an inositol excretion phenotype and was not auxotrophic for choline. Inositol, but not choline, stimulated growth of the mutant. The opi3-3 mutation was recessive and was genetically linked to the ino4 locus. When grown in the absence of exogenous choline, the opi3-3 mutant had a phospholipid composition consisting of 2 to 3% phosphatidylcholine compared with 40 to 50% in wild-type strains. In addition, the mutant accumulated elevated amounts of two intermediates, phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine and phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine. The incorporation of label from [methyl-14C]methionine into phosphatidylcholine was reduced 80 to 90% in the mutant compared with wild-type strains. However, label was recovered in the intermediates phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine and phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine. The mutant is believed to be defective in the third and possibly the second methylation reaction in the formation of phosphatidylcholine from phosphatidylethanolamine. The first methylation reaction appeared to be occurring at normal or even elevated levels. Based upon incorporation of choline into phosphatidylcholine, it is concluded that the opi3-3 mutant has no defect in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine from exogenous choline. Furthermore, phosphatidylcholine represents over 25% of the phospholipid composition of the mutant when it is grown in the presence of exogenous choline.

12606647|t|Acute mechanism of medium chain fatty acid-induced enhancement of airway epithelial permeability.
12606647|a|The localization of viral receptors to the basolateral surface of airway epithelia is an obstacle to the effectiveness of luminal viral-mediated gene transfer to the lung. The tight junction (TJ) serves as a rate-limiting barrier to the penetration of viral vectors. We have previously identified the sodium salt of the medium chain fatty acid (MCFA) capric acid (C10) as an agent that can enhance the ability of adenoviral vectors to transduce well differentiated (WD) primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cells. Previous studies have suggested that intracellular calcium (Ca(i)2+) levels may play a central role in the long-term C10-mediated increases in junctional permeability. In this study, we investigated the effects of C10 and lauric acid (C12) on Ca(i)2+ in WD primary HAE cells and determined whether these effects were necessary for the acute MCFA-induced reduction in transepithelial resistance (R(T)) and increased permeability. In addition, we characterized the effects of C10 and C12 on components localized to the TJ, including ZO-1, junctional adhesion molecule (JAM), and the claudin family of transmembrane proteins. In addition to rapidly decreasing R(T), C10 and C12 increased cellular and paracellular permeability. C10 induced a rapid, sustained increase in Ca(i)2+. However, buffering Ca(i)2+ did not block the effects of C10 on R(T). Both C10 and C12 caused reorganization of claudins-1, -4, JAM, and beta-catenin, but not ZO-1. These data suggest that C10 and C12 exert their acute effects on airway TJs via a Ca(2+)-independent mechanism of action and may alter junctional permeability via direct effects on the claudin family of TJ proteins.

17270717|t|Extension of Einstein's viscosity equation to that for concentrated dispersions of solutes and particles.
17270717|a|A viscosity equation for concentrated solutions or suspensions is derived as an extension of Einstein's hydrodynamic viscosity theory for dilute dispersions of spherical particles. The derivation of the equation is based on the calculation of dissipation of mechanical energy into heat in the dispersion, subtracting the energy dissipation in the portion of solutes or particles. The viscosity equation derived thus was well fitted to the viscosity-concentration relationship of the concentrated aqueous solutions of glucose and sucrose. For the suspensions of bakers' yeast, the concentration dependency of viscosity was expressed well with some modification for the flow pattern around suspended particles. It is suggested that these viscosity equations can be widely applied to both diluted and concentrated dispersions of various solutes and particles.

27065887|t|Insulin Is a Key Modulator of Fetoplacental Endothelium Metabolic Disturbances in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.
27065887|a|Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a disease of the mother that associates with altered fetoplacental vascular function. GDM-associated maternal hyperglycaemia result in fetal hyperglycaemia, a condition that leads to fetal hyperinsulinemia and altered L-arginine transport and synthesis of nitric oxide, i.e., endothelial dysfunction. These alterations in the fetoplacental endothelial function are present in women with GDM that were under diet or insulin therapy. Since these women and their newborn show normal glycaemia at term, other factors or conditions could be altered and/or not resolved by restoring normal level of circulating D-glucose. GDM associates with metabolic disturbances, such as abnormal handling of the locally released vasodilator adenosine, and biosynthesis and metabolism of cholesterol lipoproteins, or metabolic diseases resulting in endoplasmic reticulum stress and altered angiogenesis. Insulin acts as a potent modulator of all these phenomena under normal conditions as reported in primary cultures of cells obtained from the human placenta; however, GDM and the role of insulin regarding these alterations in this disease are poorly understood. This review focuses on the potential link between insulin and endoplasmic reticulum stress, hypercholesterolemia, and angiogenesis in GDM in the human fetoplacental vasculature. Based in reports in primary culture placental endothelium we propose that insulin is a factor restoring endothelial function in GDM by reversing ERS, hypercholesterolaemia and angiogenesis to a physiological state involving insulin activation of insulin receptor isoforms and adenosine receptors and metabolism in the human placenta from GDM pregnancies.

16597917|t|Thermosensitive TRP ion channels mediate cytosolic calcium response in human synoviocytes.
16597917|a|The transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are important membrane sensors, responding to thermal, chemical, osmotic, or mechanical stimuli by activation of calcium and sodium fluxes. In this study, three distinct TRP channels were detected and their role established in mediating cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](cyt)) response in tumor-derived SW982 synoviocytes and primary cultures of human synovial cells from patients with inflammatory arthropathies. As shown by fura-2 ratio measurements while cells were incubated in a temperature-regulated chamber, significant [Ca(2+)](cyt) elevation was elicited by rapid changes in bath temperature, application of TRPV1 receptor agonists capsaicin and resiniferatoxin, or a cold receptor stimulator, icilin. Temperature thresholds for calcium response were determined to be 12 +/- 1 degrees C for cold and 28 +/- 2 degrees C for heat activation. Temperature increases or decreases beyond these thresholds resulted in a significant rise in the magnitude of [Ca(2+)](cyt) spikes. Observed changes in [Ca(2+)](cyt) were completely abolished in calcium-free medium and thus resulted from direct calcium entry through TRP channels rather then by activation of voltage-dependent calcium channels. Two heat sensitive channels, TRPV1 and TRPV4, and a cold-sensitive channel, TRPA1, were detected by RT-PCR. Minimal mRNA for TRPV3 or TRPM8 was amplified. The RT-PCR results support the data obtained with the [Ca(2+)](cyt) measurements. We propose that the TRP channels are functionally expressed in human synoviocytes and may play a critical role in adaptive or pathological changes in articular surfaces during arthritic inflammation.

22136426|t|Effects of varied ionic calcium and phosphate on the proliferation, osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of human periodontal ligament cells in vitro.
22136426|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: A number of bone-filling materials containing calcium (Ca(2+) ) and phosphate (P) ions have been used in the repair of periodontal bone defects; however, the effects that local release of Ca(2+) and P ions has on biological reactions are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of various levels of Ca(2+) and P ions on the proliferation, osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The hPDLCs were obtained using an explant culture method. Defined concentrations and ratios of ionic Ca(2+) to inorganic P were added to standard culture and osteogenic induction media. The ability of hPDLCs to proliferate in these growth media was assayed using the Cell Counting Kit-8. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by the fluorescein isothiocyanate-annexin V/propidium iodide double-staining method. Osteogenic differentiation and mineralization were investigated by morphological observations, alkaline phosphatase activity and Alizarin Red S/von Kossa staining. The mRNA expression of osteogenic related markers was analysed using RT-PCR. RESULTS: Within the ranges of Ca(2+) and P ion concentrations tested, we observed that increased concentrations of Ca(2+) and P ions enhanced cell proliferation and formation of mineralized matrix nodules, whereas alkaline phosphatase activity was reduced. The RT-PCR results showed that elevated concentrations of Ca(2+) and P ions led to a general increase of Runx2 mRNA expression and decreased alkaline phosphatase mRNA expression, but gave no clear trend on osteocalcin mRNA levels. CONCLUSION: The concentrations and ratios of Ca(2+) and P ions could significantly influence proliferation, differentiation and mineralization of hPDLCs. Within the range of concentrations tested, we found that the combination of 9.0 mm Ca(2+) ions and 4.5 mm P ions were the optimal concentrations for proliferation, differentiation and mineralization in hPDLCs.

17015278|t|The reductive activation of the antitumor drug RH1 to its semiquinone free radical by NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase and by HCT116 human colon cancer cells.
17015278|a|RH1 (2,5-diaziridinyl-3-(hydroxymethyl)-6-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone), which is currently in clinical trials, is a diaziridinyl benzoquinone bioreductive anticancer drug that was designed to be activated by the obligate two-electron reductive enzyme NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). In this electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) study we showed that RH1 was reductively activated by the one-electron reductive enzyme NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase and by a suspension of HCT116 human colon cancer cells to yield a semiquinone free radical. As shown by EPR spin trapping experiments RH1 was reductively activated by cytochrome P450 reductase and underwent redox cycling to produce damaging hydroxyl radicals in reactions that were both H2O2- and iron-dependent. Thus, reductive activation by cytochrome P450 reductase or other reductases to produce a semiquinone that can redox cycle to produce damaging hydroxyl radicals and/or DNA-reactive alkylating species may contribute to the potent cell growth inhibitory effects of RH1. These results also suggest that selection of patients for treatment with RH1 based on their expression levels of NQO1 may be problematic.

11865083|t|Mechanism of vascular smooth muscle cells activation by hydrogen peroxide: role of phospholipase C gamma.
11865083|a|BACKGROUND: Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) formation is a critical factor in processes involving ischaemia/ reperfusion. However, the precise mechanism by which reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce vascular damage are insufficiently known. Specifically, activation of phospholipase C gamma (PLCgamma) is a probable candidate pathway involved in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) activation by H2O2. METHODS: The activation of human venous VSMC was measured as cytosolic free calcium mobilization, shape change and protein phosphorylation, focusing on the role of tyrosine phosphorylation-activated PLCgamma. RESULTS: The exposure of VSMC to exogenous H2O2 caused a rapid increase in cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), and induced a significant VSMC shape change. Both effects were dependent on a tyrosine kinase-mediated mechanism, as determined by the blockade of short-term treatment of VSMC with the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein. Giving further support to the putative role of phospholipase C (PLC)-dependent pathways, the [Ca2+]i and VSMC shape change response were equally inhibited by the specific PLC blocker, 1-(6-((17-beta-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)trien-17-yl)amino)hexyl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (U73122). In addition, U73122 had a protective effect against the deleterious action (24 h) of H2O2 on non-confluent VSMC. As a further clarification of the specific pathway involved, the exposure to H2O2 significantly stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCgamma with a concentration- and time-profile similar to that of [Ca(2+)](i) mobilization. CONCLUSIONS: The present study reveals that H(2)O(2) activates PLCgamma on VSMC through tyrosine phosphorylation and that this activation has a major role in rapid [Ca(2+)](i) mobilization, shape-changing actions and damage by H(2)O(2) in this type of cells. These findings have direct implications for understanding the mechanisms of the vascular actions of H(2)O(2) and may help to design pharmacologically protective strategies.

12160190|t|PAI-1 in human hypertension: relation to hypertensive groups.
12160190|a|BACKGROUND: Although the renin-angiotensin system and insulin resistance (IR) have been identified as major regulators of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), their roles in hypertensive subjects is not clearly defined. METHODS: We examined the effect of dietary salt restriction on PAI-1 levels in 239 hypertensive subjects from three centers. Subjects were placed on a 200 and 10 mmol/day sodium diets for 1-week periods. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and PAI-1 levels were measured on the last day of both diets and fasting insulin, glucose, and aldosterone (ALDO) levels, only on the low salt diet. RESULTS: Sodium restriction increased PAI-1 levels from 32.1 +/- 2.5 ng/mL to 39.8 +/- 3.2 ng/mL (P = .009). There was a strong positive correlation between PAI-1 levels and PRA (r = 0.228, P = .0004), IR (r = 0.222, P = .001), triglycerides (r = 0.275, P < .001), and ALDO (P = .018 for linear trend). The patients were divided into low renin (low IR and ALDO levels), nonmodulators (normal PRA, high IR, and low ALDO levels), and modulators (normal PRA, intermediate IR, and normal ALDO levels) groups to assess the relative contribution of each factor to PAI-1 levels. Modulators had significantly (P = .019) higher PAI-1 levels compared to the low renin and nonmodulators who had similar PAI-1 levels. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma renin activity, IR, and ALDO all correlate with PAI-1 levels in the hypertensive subjects. However, the data suggest that ALDO may be an important factor contributing to the variability of PAI-1 levels in individual hypertensive subjects.

17468205|t|H+-coupled nutrient, micronutrient and drug transporters in the mammalian small intestine.
17468205|a|The H(+)-electrochemical gradient was originally considered as a driving force for solute transport only across cellular membranes of bacteria, plants and yeast. However, in the mammalian small intestine, a H(+)-electrochemical gradient is present at the epithelial brush-border membrane in the form of an acid microclimate. Over recent years, a large number of H(+)-coupled cotransport mechanisms have been identified at the luminal membrane of the mammalian small intestine. These transporters are responsible for the initial stage in absorption of a remarkable variety of essential and non-essential nutrients and micronutrients, including protein digestion products (di/tripeptides and amino acids), vitamins, short-chain fatty acids and divalent metal ions. Proton-coupled cotransporters expressed at the mammalian small intestinal brush-border membrane include: the di/tripeptide transporter PepT1 (SLC15A1); the proton-coupled amino-acid transporter PAT1 (SLC36A1); the divalent metal transporter DMT1 (SLC11A2); the organic anion transporting polypeptide OATP2B1 (SLC02B1); the monocarboxylate transporter MCT1 (SLC16A1); the proton-coupled folate transporter PCFT (SLC46A1); the sodium-glucose linked cotransporter SGLT1 (SLC5A1); and the excitatory amino acid carrier EAAC1 (SLC1A1). Emerging research demonstrates that the optimal intestinal absorptive capacity of certain H(+)-coupled cotransporters (PepT1 and PAT1) is dependent upon function of the brush-border Na(+)-H(+) exchanger NHE3 (SLC9A3). The high oral bioavailability of a large number of pharmaceutical compounds results, in part, from absorptive transport via the same H(+)-coupled cotransporters. Drugs undergoing H(+)-coupled cotransport across the intestinal brush-border membrane include those used to treat bacterial infections, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, hyperglycaemia, viral infections, allergies, epilepsy, schizophrenia, rheumatoid arthritis and cancer.

23201463|t|Multiscale analysis of hypoxemia in methemoglobin anemia.
23201463|a|Methemoglobinemia is a disease that results from abnormally high levels of methemoglobin (MetHb) in the red blood cell (RBC), which is caused by simultaneous uptake of oxygen (O(2)) and nitric oxide (NO) in the human lungs. MetHb is produced in the RBC by irreversible NO-induced oxidation of the oxygen carrying ferrous ion (Fe(2+)) present in the heme group of the hemoglobin (Hb) molecule to its non-oxygen binding ferric state (Fe(3+)). This paper studies the role of NO in the pathophysiology of methemoglobinemia and presents a multiscale quantitative analysis of the relation between the levels of NO inhaled by the patient and the hypoxemia resulting from the disease. Reactions of NO occurring in the RBC with both Hb and oxyhemoglobin are considered in conjunction with the usual reaction between oxygen and Hb to form oxyhemoglobin. Our dynamic simulations of NO and O(2) uptake in the RBC (micro scale), alveolar capillary (meso scale) and the entire lung (macro scale) under continuous, simultaneous exposure to both gases, reveal that NO uptake competes with the reactive uptake of O(2), thus suppressing the latter and causing hypoxemia. We also find that the mass transfer resistances increase from micro through meso to macro scales, thus decreasing O(2) saturation as one goes up the scales from the cellular to the organ (lung) level. We show that NO levels of 203 ppm or higher while breathing in room air may be considered to be fatal for methemoglobinemia patients since it causes severe hypoxemia by reducing the O(2) saturation below a critical value of 88%, at which Long Term Oxygen Therapy (LTOT) becomes necessary.

15817701|t|TNFR1-induced sphingomyelinase activation modulates TCR signaling by impairing store-operated Ca2+ influx.
15817701|a|Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is a potent, pleiotrophic cytokine, which is proinflammatory but can also suppress T lymphocyte function. In chronic inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, exposure of T cells to TNF-alpha alters their ability to mount a response by modulating the T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway, but the mechanisms involved remain obscure. Here, we investigated the specific role of TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) signaling in the modulation of the TCR signaling pathway. We observed a down-regulation of the intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) signal in Jurkat T cells after just 30 min exposure to TNF-alpha, and maximum suppression was reached after 3 h. This effect was transient, and signals returned to normal after 12 h. This depression of [Ca(2+)](i) was also observed in human CD4+ T lymphocytes. The change in Ca(2+) signal was related to a decrease in the plasma membrane Ca(2+) influx, which was apparent even when the TCR signal was bypassed using thapsigargin to induce a Ca(2+) influx. The role of TNF-alpha-induced activation of the sphingolipid cascade in this pathway was examined. The engagement of TNFR1 by TNF-alpha led to a time-dependent increase in acid sphingomyelinase (SMase; ASM) activity, corresponding with a decrease in cellular sphingomyelin. In parallel, there was an increase in cellular ceramide, which correlated directly with the decrease in the magnitude of the Ca(2+) response to phytohemagglutinin. Exogenous addition of SMase or ceramide mimicked the effects of TNFR1 signals on Ca(2+) responses in Jurkat T cells. Direct evidence for the activation of ASM in this pathway was provided by complete abrogation of the TNF-alpha-induced inhibition of the Ca(2+) influx in an ASM-deficient murine T cell line (OT-II(+/+)ASM(-/-)). This potent ability of TNF-alpha to rapidly modulate the TCR Ca(2+) signal via TNFR1-induced ASM activation can explain its suppressive effect on T cell function. This TNFR1 signaling pathway may play a role as an important regulator of T cell responses.

9347317|t|Acetate and propionate potentiate the antiproliferative effect of butyrate on RBL-2H3 growth.
9347317|a|1. The effect of acetate, propionate, and butyrate separately and combined on RBL-2H3 (a rat basophilic leukemic cell type) proliferation during 24, 48, and 72 hr was examined. Also, the effect of a mixture of the three volatile fatty acids on proliferation of HeLa-155 (a human adenocarcinoma), C57 B1/6J (a mouse melanoma), and MCF-7 (human breast tumor) during 8 days was investigated. 2. Acetate and propionate per se did not present any effect on RBL-2H3 growth during 72 hr, however, when acetate and propionate were added together a significant inhibition of this cell growth was found; 18% for 48 and 37% for 72 hr. The addition of butyrate to the culture medium caused a 75% decrease in the rate of this cell growth either after 48 and 72 hr. This effect of butyrate was pronounced by acetate (86% and 90% for 48 and 72 hr, respectively), propionate (87% for 48 and 93% for 72 hr), and acetate and propionate together (76% for 48 and 92% for 72 hr). 3. Daily addition of a mixture of the short-chain fatty acids (10 mM acetate, 2 mM propionate and 1.5 mM butyrate) markedly decreased the number of cells after 8 days: 58% for RBL-2H3, 42% for HeLa-155, 91% for C57 B1/6J and 55% for MCF-7. 4. These results support the proposition that a fiber-rich diet that leads to great production of butyrate but also of propionate and acetate would be more effective to prevent the occurrence of colorectal cancer than the administration of this short-chain fatty acid given alone.

26742071|t|Polyphenols and Glycemic Control.
26742071|a|Growing evidence from animal studies supports the anti-diabetic properties of some dietary polyphenols, suggesting that dietary polyphenols could be one dietary therapy for the prevention and management of Type 2 diabetes. This review aims to address the potential mechanisms of action of dietary polyphenols in the regulation of glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity based on in vitro and in vivo studies, and to provide a comprehensive overview of the anti-diabetic effects of commonly consumed dietary polyphenols including polyphenol-rich mixed diets, tea and coffee, chocolate and cocoa, cinnamon, grape, pomegranate, red wine, berries and olive oil, with a focus on human clinical trials. Dietary polyphenols may inhibit α-amylase and α-glucosidase, inhibit glucose absorption in the intestine by sodium-dependent glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1), stimulate insulin secretion and reduce hepatic glucose output. Polyphenols may also enhance insulin-dependent glucose uptake, activate 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), modify the microbiome and have anti-inflammatory effects. However, human epidemiological and intervention studies have shown inconsistent results. Further intervention studies are essential to clarify the conflicting findings and confirm or refute the anti-diabetic effects of dietary polyphenols.

10729197|t|Sandwich configuration of type I collagen suppresses progesterone production in primary cultured porcine granulosa cells by reducing gene expression of cytochrome P450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme.
10729197|a|When porcine granulosa cells were cultured on type I collagen (TIC)-coated dishes, progesterone was continuously secreted in the culture medium. However, when cells were overlaid with a TIC gel, progesterone production was decreased to 34% (day 3) and 16% (day 4) of the value measured for cells without the overlay. The effect of TIC gel overlay on cytochrome P450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc), which catalyzes the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone and is thought to be the rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of cholesterol to progesterone, was examined. P450scc gene expression in cells overlaid with a TIC gel was decreased to 62% (day 3) and 36% (day 4) of the value measured for cells without the overlay. Amounts of P450scc were also reduced in the cells overlaid with a TIC gel. When pregnenolone, the direct precursor of progesterone, was added to the culture medium, the increase in progesterone production by cells overlaid with a TIC gel was much greater than that for cells without a TIC gel and a statistical difference in progesterone production was no longer observed between the two groups of cells. Treatment of the cells with human FSH (hFSH) enhanced progesterone production in a dose-dependent manner, irrespective of the presence of a TIC gel overlay. Moreover, hFSH induced P450scc gene expression in cells with and without a TIC gel overlay. These results indicate that a TIC gel overlay reduces progesterone production in granulosa cells via the suppression of P450scc gene expression. This supports the possibility that the existence of a TIC gel on the apical side of granulosa cells prevents the spontaneous luteinization of granulosa cells cultured on TIC-coated dishes. The fact that hFSH overcomes the suppressive effect of the TIC gel overlay on progesterone production may explain the mechanism for the subtle rise in serum progesterone concentration in the late follicle phase of the "in vitro fertilization" program.

16701961|t|Antioxidative and acute antiinflammatory effects of Torreya grandis.
16701961|a|The present study was undertaken to investigate the antioxidative and antiinflammatory activities of the ethanolic extract of seeds of Torreya grandis (EST). Exposure of human dermal fibroblasts to the extract at 50 and 250 microg/ml showed significant protective effect against hydrogen peroxide (300 microM). EST not only protected cell survival from H(2)O(2)-induced toxicity, but also inhibited the H(2)O(2)-induced LDH release significantly. It was also found that EST at 100 and 1000 microg/ml showed scavenging activities of radicals and reactive oxygen species with 29.8% and 100.0% of inhibition against DPPH radical and 41.2% and 98.4% against superoxide radicals in the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system, respectively. Topically applied EST dose-dependently inhibited arachidonic acid (AA)- and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced ear edema in mice.

7543698|t|CFTR as a cAMP-dependent regulator of sodium channels.
7543698|a|Cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), the gene product that is mutated in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, has a well-recognized function as a cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-regulated chloride channel, but this property does not account for the abnormally high basal rate and cAMP sensitivity of sodium ion absorption in CF airway epithelia. Expression of complementary DNAs for rat epithelial Na+ channel (rENaC) alone in Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells generated large amiloride-sensitive sodium currents that were stimulated by cAMP, whereas coexpression of human CFTR with rENaC generated smaller basal sodium currents that were inhibited by cAMP. Parallel studies that measured regulation of sodium permeability in fibroblasts showed similar results. In CF airway epithelia, the absence of this second function of CFTR as a cAMP-dependent regulator likely accounts for abnormal sodium transport.

27344261|t|A revision in hydrogen isotopic composition of USGS42 and USGS43 human-hair stable isotopic reference materials for forensic science.
27344261|a|The hydrogen isotopic composition (δ(2)HVSMOW-SLAP) of USGS42 and USGS43 human hair stable isotopic reference materials, normalized to the VSMOW (Vienna-Standard Mean Ocean Water)-SLAP (Standard Light Antarctic Precipitation) scale, was originally determined with a high temperature conversion technique using an elemental analyzer (TC/EA) with a glassy carbon tube and glassy carbon filling and analysis by isotope-ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS). However, the TC/EA IRMS method can produce inaccurate δ(2)HVSMOW-SLAP results when analyzing nitrogen-bearing organic substances owing to the formation of hydrogen cyanide (HCN), leading to non-quantitative conversion of a sample into molecular hydrogen (H2) for IRMS analysis. A single-oven, chromium-filled, elemental analyzer (Cr-EA) coupled to an IRMS substantially improves the measurement quality and reliability of hydrogen isotopic analysis of hydrogen- and nitrogen-bearing organic material because hot chromium scavenges all reactive elements except hydrogen. USGS42 and USGS43 human hair isotopic reference materials have been analyzed with the Cr-EA IRMS method, and the δ(2)HVSMOW-SLAP values of their non-exchangeable hydrogen fractions have been revised: [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] where mUr=0.001=‰. On average, these revised δ(2)HVSMOW-SLAP values are 5.7mUr more positive than those previously measured. It is critical that readers pay attention to the δ(2)HVSMOW-SLAP of isotopic reference materials in publications as they may need to adjust the δ(2)HVSMOW-SLAP measurement results of human hair in previous publications to ensure all results are on the same isotope-delta scale.

12358503|t|In vitro fermentability of differently substituted xylo-oligosaccharides.
12358503|a|Xylo-oligosaccharides (XOS) with various substituents were fermented in vitro by fecal inocula (FI) from four human volunteers to study the influence of substitution on the ability and rate of fermentation and on the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and lactate. By all FI used nonsubstituted XOS (nXOS) and arabino-XOS (AXOS) were fermented more quickly than the more complex structures of acetylated XOS (AcXOS) and XOS containing a 4-O-methylglucuronic acid group (GlcA(me)XOS). In the first stage (0-40 h) of the fermentations of nXOS and AXOS mainly acetate and lactate were formed. The fermentations of AcXOS and GlcA(me)XOS resulted in a lower lactate production, whereas the concentration of propionate and butyrate increased. These results put emphasis on the detailed elucidation of the structural features of nondigestible oligosaccharides in general to understand their fermentation mechanisms more precisely.

15579020|t|The chemical dynamics of NO and reactive nitrogen oxides: a practical guide.
15579020|a|Nitric oxide has emerged as one of the most important and diverse players in physiology. This small diatomic radical stunned researchers because of its existence and unique biological properties in human physiology. Over the last two decades it was found that NO often has fickle behavior in pathophysiological mechanisms. Where benefiting the host in one case yet inducing and augmenting injury in another. This has lead to confusion in is NO good or bad? Much of the answers to this dichotomy lies in the chemistry of NO and its related nitrogen oxide species. To help understand the complex chemistry with perspective to biology, a discussion on the chemical biology of NO is useful. The chemical biology defines the relevant chemical reaction of NO and nitrogen monoxide in the context of the biological conditions. We discuss in this article the chemistry of nitrogen oxide with different types of biological motifs. Reaction of NO with metal complexes and radicals require low concentration, where formation of reactive nitrogen oxide species require considerably higher amounts and generally are isolated to specific microenvironments in vivo. Though many reactive nitrogen oxide species are formed from chemical reactions with NO, there are several which appear to not require NO to be present, HNO and NO(2). These two species have unique physiological effects and represent additional complexity to this biological picture. From this discussion, a picture can be formed concerning the possible chemical dynamics, which can be plausible in different biological mechanisms.

26802574|t|Near-infrared fluorescence nanoprobe for enzyme-substrate system sensing and in vitro imaging.
26802574|a|Herein we report a simple and sensitive fluorescent sensing platform for phenol and enzyme activity detection based on 3-aminobenzeneboronic acid functionalized CuInS2 QDs (APBA-CuInS2 QDs). APBA were covalently linked to CuInS2 QDs surface to form the APBA-CuInS2 QDs which had a fairly symmetric fluorescence emission peak at 736 nm in the near-infrared spectral region. In the presence of tyrosinase, phenol can be catalyzed the oxidization into catechol, which could reactive toward the boronic acid functional groups of APBA-CuInS2 QDs to form five-membered cyclic esters, leading to the fluorescence quenching of the QDs. The effective fluorescence quenching of APBA-CuInS2 QDs by phenol enabled this proposed nanosensor to sensitively detect the phenol product-related enzyme system, such as acid phosphatase-catalyzed hydrolysis of phenyl phosphate. Thus, the proposed biosensor was utilized for facile, sensitive, and selective detection phenol, tyrosinase and acid phosphatase. The detection limits of phenol, tyrosinase and acid phosphatase reached 0.05 μmol L(-1), 0.03 U mL(-1) and 6 nU mL(-1) for, respectively. The feasibility of the proposed nanosensor in real samples assay was also studied and satisfactory results were obtained. Meanwhile, using the APBA-CuInS2 QDs fluorescence probe, we successfully performed in vitro imaging of human prostate cancer cells, suggesting the biocompatible sensor has potentially extensive application clinic diagnoses assays.

16940548|t|RNA editing level in the mouse is determined by the genomic repeat repertoire.
16940548|a|A-to-I RNA editing is the conversion of adenosine to inosine in double-stranded cellular and viral RNAs. Recently, abundant editing of human transcripts affecting thousands of genes has been reported. Most editing sites are confined to the primate-specific Alu repeats. Notably, the editing level in mouse was shown to be much lower. In order to find the reason for this dramatic difference, here we identify editing sites within mouse repeats and analyze the sequence properties required for RNA editing. Our results show that the overall rate of RNA editing is determined by specific properties of different repeat families such as abundance, length, and divergence. We show that the striking difference in editing levels between human and mouse is mostly due to the higher divergence of the different mouse repeats.

11030205|t|Hypercalcemia induced with the plasma levels of parathyroid hormone-related peptide in multiple myeloma.
11030205|a|A 69-year-old man visited our department of neurology with symptoms of paresthesia on the lower extremities and lumbago. Biochemical examination of serum samples showed hypercalcemia (serum concentration 15.6 mg/dl). The levels of intact parathyroid hormone (i-PTH) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were suppressed, whereas parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) was elevated up to 5.4 pM (normal range: below 0.6 pM). Additionally, bone survey revealed a punched-out lesion in radiological examinations of the skull. Bone marrow aspiration demonstrated many atypical plasma cells suggesting multiple myeloma. Nephrogenous cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), urinary deoxypyridinoline, plasma interleukin 6 (IL-6) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) concentrations were elevated, whereas % of renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate (%TRP) was decreased. The immunohistochemical results demonstrated the expression of PTHrP in atypical plasma cells. These data indicated that hypercalcemia complicating multiple myeloma causes an elevation of renal calcium reabsorption and an increase of bone resorption mediated by PTHrP action.

8987640|t|The occurrence of killer, sensitive, and neutral yeasts in Brazilian Riesling Italico grape must and the effect of neutral strains on killing behaviour.
8987640|a|The occurrence of killer toxins amongst yeast in Brazilian Riesling Italico grape must was investigated by using the sensitive strain EMBRAPA-26B as a reference strain at 18 degrees C and 28 degrees C. From a total of 85 previously isolated yeasts, 21 strains showed ability to kill the sensitive strain on unbuffered grape must/agar (MA-MB) and 0.1 M citrate/phosphate-buffered yeast extract/peptone/dextrose/agar (YEPD-MB) media both supplemented with 30 mg/l methylene blue. The killer activity of only four yeasts depended on the incubation temperature rather than the medium used. At 28 degrees C, the strains 11B and 53B were not able to show killer action. On the other hand, strains 49B and 84B did not kill the sensitive yeast at 18 degrees C. The killer strain EMBRAPA-91B and a commercial wine killer yeast K-1 were employed to examine the sensitivity of the isolated yeasts on YEPD-MB and MA-MB at 18 degrees C. The sensitivity and neutral characteristics of yeasts were shown to be dependent on the medium and the killer strain. Interactions, including K-R-, K-R+ and K+R+ strains, simultaneously, have revealed that some K-R+ strains appear to protect the K-R- strain against the killer toxin. Sensitive dead cells, although to a less extent, also exhibited similar protection. Kinetic studies have shown that the maximum specific growth rates were higher for the 20B YEPD-MB-sensitive strains (mu(max) = 0.517 h-1) than for both the 91B (mu(max) = 0.428 h-1) and K-1 (mu(max) = 0.466 h-1) killer strains. The protective capacity of neutral or sensitive cells that contaminate a fermentation, as well as the higher maximum specific growth rate of sensitive yeasts, besides other factors, may preclude the dominance of a killer strain. This protective capacity may also reduce the risk of a sensitive inoculum being killed by wild-type killer yeasts in open non-sterile fermentation.

20302403|t|Pathogenesis of primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction.
20302403|a|PURPOSE: To assess the factors assumed to be contributed in pathogenesis of primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction (PANDO). METHODS: In a prospective, controlled, interventional case series, 87 patients with symptomatic PANDO (case), 7 with traumatic nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) (control), 2 with congenital NLDO (control), and 70 asymptomatic females (control) were enrolled. Frequency of putting eye make-up (PANDO versus normal females), level of sexual hormones consisting of follicular stimulating hormone (FSH), luteal hormone (LH), estradiol, progesterone and testosterone (standard laboratory level), lacrimal sac biopsy for inflammation and fibrosis and immunohistochemistry for herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 and 2, and human papilloma virus were recorded. RESULTS: Severity of inflammation and fibrosis were not significantly different between case and control groups (P = 0.69), and between smokers and nonsmokers with PANDO (P = 0.15). Patients with severe preoperative symptoms showed significantly more lacrimal sac fibrosis (P = 0.018). No lacrimal sac pathology was found. Frequency of putting eye make-up was not significantly different between case and control group (0.596). Immunohistochemistry was negative for the viruses in all cases. There was no abnormal sexual hormone level in any case in this series. CONCLUSION: This study did not find any evidence in favor of the role of viral infection (HSV1, HSV2, HPV), eye make-up, and sex hormones in pathogenesis of PANDO. No abnormal pathology was found in lacrimal sac biopsy of patients with PANDO.

843983|t|Biosynthesis of arglecin and related compounds.
843983|a|The requirements for maximum production of arglecin, 3-isobuty1-6-(3-guanidinopropyl)-2(1H)pyrazinone, by Streptomyces toxytricini grown on either yeast extract or synthetic medium were supplements of L-arginine and L-leucine. The arglecin produced was derived to a major extent from these amino acids, as was shown by comparison of specific activities in 14C-labeling experiments. Various compounds related to arglecin could be synthesized by the organism, and these were isolated and their structures determined primarily by natural-abundance carbon-13 and proton magnetic resonance methods. In old cultures which had produced arglecin, the metabolite 3-isobuty1-6-(3-aminopropy1)-2(1H)pyrazinone was found. In cultures grown on synthetic medium supplemented with L-leucine and L-homoarginine, the metabolit 3-isobuty1-6(4-guanidinobuty1)-2-(1H)pyrazinone was found, and in cultures that had been supplemented with L-norleucine and L-arginine, the metabolite 3-buty1-6-(3-guanidinopropy1)-2(1H)pyrazinone was found.

10468922|t|A trial of growth hormone therapy in well-controlled hypophosphataemic rickets.
10468922|a|OBJECTIVE: Conventional therapy of hypophosphataemic rickets (HR) with oral phosphate and calcitriol does not always result in normal linear growth. Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) offers theoretical advantages as an adjunctive therapy. We aimed to determine the effects of adjunctive rhGH therapy in children with well-controlled HR. PATIENTS: In this report, 5 prepubertal children (aged 3.5-10.9 years) with well-controlled HR on conventional therapy were given adjunctive standard dose rhGH therapy for one year. DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS: Height, growth velocity, metabolic markers of calcium and phosphate metabolism, body composition, bone mineral density, wrist and knee X-rays, and renal sonography were assessed at regular intervals. Height and growth velocities were also calculated 12 months after ceasing rhGH therapy. RESULTS: After 12 months therapy with rhGH, no significant biochemical or radiological benefits were observed. A significant increase in height SD score was observed (P = 0.023), but this was not associated with any increase in the growth velocity SD score and appears to have been due to catch-up growth caused by conventional therapy alone. When rhGH therapy was ceased, no significant decreases in mean height SD or growth velocity SD scores were observed. CONCLUSIONS: In well-controlled hypophosphataemic rickets patients receiving conventional therapy, adjunctive therapy with standard dose rhGH offers no benefits in linear growth or rachitic disease markers.

28973375|t|Editor's Highlight: Comparative Dose-Response Analysis of Liver and Kidney Transcriptomic Effects of Trichloroethylene and Tetrachloroethylene in B6C3F1 Mouse.
28973375|a|Trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants and occupational health hazards. Recent health assessments of these agents identified several critical data gaps, including lack of comparative analysis of their effects. This study examined liver and kidney effects of TCE and PCE in a dose-response study design. Equimolar doses of TCE (24, 80, 240, and 800 mg/kg) or PCE (30, 100, 300, and 1000 mg/kg) were administered by gavage in aqueous vehicle to male B6C3F1/J mice. Tissues were collected 24 h after exposure. Trichloroacetic acid (TCA), a major oxidative metabolite of both compounds, was measured and RNA sequencing was performed. PCE had a stronger effect on liver and kidney transcriptomes, as well as greater concentrations of TCA. Most dose-responsive pathways were common among chemicals/tissues, with the strongest effect on peroxisomal β-oxidation. Effects on liver and kidney mitochondria-related pathways were notably unique to PCE. We performed dose-response modeling of the transcriptomic data and compared the resulting points of departure (PODs) to those for apical endpoints derived from long-term studies with these chemicals in rats, mice, and humans, converting to human equivalent doses using tissue-specific dosimetry models. Tissue-specific acute transcriptional effects of TCE and PCE occurred at human equivalent doses comparable to those for apical effects. These data are relevant for human health assessments of TCE and PCE as they provide data for dose-response analysis of the toxicity mechanisms. Additionally, they provide further evidence that transcriptomic data can be useful surrogates for in vivo PODs, especially when toxicokinetic differences are taken into account.

15328306|t|Paroxetine administration failed [corrected] to influence human exercise capacity, perceived effort or hormone responses during prolonged exercise in a warm environment.
15328306|a|The purpose of the experiment was to examine whether selective serotonin (5-HT) re-uptake transporter blockade by paroxetine has any effect on perceived effort (RPE) during exercise or the time to reach volitional fatigue and on the prolactin and cortisol responses during prolonged exercise performed in a warm environment. Eight healthy males performed two cycle rides to exhaustion in a warm (32 degrees C) environment at 60% of maximum oxygen uptake. Paroxetine (20 mg) or placebo was administered 5 h before exercise trials in a randomised double blind fashion. Time to exhaustion was not significantly influenced by administration of paroxetine: median (range) time to exhaustion was 93.3 (76.2-175.0) min on the placebo trial and 92.5 (66.0-151.0) min on the paroxetine trial. Rectal temperature was higher at rest and throughout exercise on the paroxetine trial. The serum concentrations of prolactin and cortisol were determined throughout exercise as peripheral markers of central 5-HT activity. RPE increased over time but was not influenced by paroxetine administration. Prolactin and cortisol levels increased over time but paroxetine administration did not influence the hormone responses during exercise. In conclusion, acute administration of paroxetine failed to alter RPE, exercise capacity or the response of the determined peripheral hormone markers of central 5-HT activity during prolonged exercise in a warm environment.

26856995|t|CFTR: A New Horizon in the Pathomechanism and Treatment of Pancreatitis.
26856995|a|Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ion channel that conducts chloride and bicarbonate ions across epithelial cell membranes. Mutations in the CFTR gene diminish the ion channel function and lead to impaired epithelial fluid transport in multiple organs such as the lung and the pancreas resulting in cystic fibrosis. Heterozygous carriers of CFTR mutations do not develop cystic fibrosis but exhibit increased risk for pancreatitis and associated pancreatic damage characterized by elevated mucus levels, fibrosis, and cyst formation. Importantly, recent studies demonstrated that pancreatitis causing insults, such as alcohol, smoking, or bile acids, strongly inhibit CFTR function. Furthermore, human studies showed reduced levels of CFTR expression and function in all forms of pancreatitis. These findings indicate that impairment of CFTR is critical in the development of pancreatitis; therefore, correcting CFTR function could be the first specific therapy in pancreatitis. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the field and discuss new possibilities for the treatment of pancreatitis.

1848028|t|In vitro/in vivo effects of ethane dimethanesulfonate on Leydig cells of adult rats.
1848028|a|Although ethane dimethanesulfonate (EDS) is well recognized as a Leydig cell toxicant, the dose responsiveness of Leydig cells to EDS, both in vitro and in vivo, is not well established. In addition, the cellular site of action of EDS during Leydig cell toxicity and the status of Leydig cell viability during the affected period remain controversial. We determined the in vitro EC50 (370 microM) and in vivo ED50 (60 mg/kg) for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-stimulated testosterone (T) production using both highly purified (98%) and interstitial (14%) Leydig cell preparations, respectively. Leydig cells were recovered in approximately equal numbers following all in vivo and in vitro EDS exposures. The Leydig cells in these preparations were viable and steroidogenically active (3 beta-HSD positive) subsequent to all exposures, both before and after incubations to stimulate T biosynthesis. When hCG-stimulated T production was decreased 50% following in vivo or in vitro exposures, the morphological integrity of the Leydig cells appeared normal, with no discernible lesion at either the light or the electron microscope level. We used stimulants of various reactions in the pathway of T biosynthesis (20 alpha-hydroxycholesterol and pregnenolone) to determine the site of action impaired when T biosynthesis was decreased. Our results indicate that when Leydig cells are exposed to EDS either in vitro or in vivo, the biosynthesis of T is compromised between the cyclic adenosine monophosphate activation of protein kinase and the cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme.

1631889|t|The genetic toxicology of cobalt.
1631889|a|Genetic and related effects of cobalt compounds are reviewed and discussed with respect to mechanisms. In prokaryotic assays, Co(II) salts generally are nonmutagenic. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, CoCl2 is mutagenic to mitochondrial genes and weakly mutagenic or nonmutagenic to chromosomal genes. In plants, Co(II) salts induced gene mutations and chromosomal aberrations. In mammalian cells in vitro, Co(II) compounds caused DNA strand breaks, sister-chromatid exchanges and aneuploidy, but not chromosomal aberrations. In two cell lines, CoCl2 was weakly mutagenic. Interestingly, the poorly soluble compound CoS caused DNA strand breaks and morphological transformation of mammalian cell lines. In contrast to its weak clastogenic and mutagenic properties, cobalt(II) exerts pronounced antimutagenicity in bacteria and mostly comutagenic effects in mammalian cells. In Escherichia coli CoCl2 lowered the frequency of mutations induced by MNNG, uv or X rays. In Chinese hamster V79 cells, CoCl2 enhanced the mutagenicity and clastogenicity of uv light but not of gamma rays. Regarding direct genotoxic mechanisms, Co(II) induces the formation of reactive oxygen species when combined with hydrogen peroxide in cell-free systems. At high (i.e., millimolar) concentrations, Co(II) also decreases the fidelity of DNA synthesis. Regarding anti- and co-mutagenic mechanisms, evidence for the interference of Co(II) with DNA repair processes is discussed. These mechanisms are regarded as relevant for the risk assessment of human exposure to cobalt in combination with other agents.

8289667|t|Lovastatin decreases plasma and platelet cholesterol levels and normalizes elevated platelet fluidity and aggregation in hypercholesterolemic patients.
8289667|a|The lipid composition of whole platelets and the fluidity of platelet membranes, as well as the sensitivity of the cell to aggregation, were studied in type IIA hypercholesterolemic human subjects before and after treatment with lovastatin. Fourteen patients with primary hypercholesterolemia having initial cholesterol levels of 383 +/- 52 mg/dL (mean +/- standard deviation) were studied and compared with 21 control subjects having cholesterol levels of 187 +/- 32 mg/dL. Lovastatin was administered orally at a starting dose of 40 mg daily. The dose was increased to 80 mg daily for eight patients who did not achieve the target cholesterol level of 200 mg/dL at 6 weeks. Serum cholesterol level was decreased by 37% following 20 weeks' administration of the drug. The fluidity of platelet membranes expressed in terms of the fluorescence anisotropy parameter was determined using the probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH). When compared with platelets obtained from normocholesterolemic controls, platelets from hypercholesterolemic patients had a higher molar ratio of cholesterol to phospholipids ([C/PL] 0.86 +/- 0.15 v 0.57 +/- 0.06 for controls) and of phosphatidylcholine to sphingomyelin ([PC/SM] 2.64 +/- 0.87 v 2.00 +/- 0.15 for controls), enhanced fluidity (anisotropy parameter at 37 degrees C of 0.892 +/- 0.066 v 0.977 +/- 0.065 for controls), and a greater tendency to aggregate (aggregation of 84.2% +/- 6.3% v 78.5% +/- 7.6% for controls).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

3301353|a|Much circumstantial and some direct evidence links a high sodium, low potassium intake to the development of essential hypertension. However, studies to prove a definite causative relationship in man are unlikely to be done for the practical reason that they need to be carried out over a whole generation. Restriction of sodium intake does lower blood pressure in many hypertensive subjects. This fall appears to be mediated in part by a diminished renin response to the sodium restriction as blood pressure becomes more severe. Less substantive evidence also suggests that increasing potassium intake may lower blood pressure but this effect seems to be more apparent when both animals and man are on a high sodium intake. It would seem sensible, therefore, in the light of present knowledge, to advise communities that have a high sodium, low potassium diet they they may benefit from a reduction in sodium and an increase in potassium intake. Patients who are already known to have high blood pressure should be advised to reduce sodium intake along with other non-pharmacological advice. In some patients this will be sufficient to control the blood pressure. In others who may then require drug treatment, the blood pressure lowering effect of beta-blockers and converting enzyme inhibitors will be enhanced by the sodium restriction.

10930409|t|Biphasic kinetics of the human DNA repair protein MED1 (MBD4), a mismatch-specific DNA N-glycosylase.
10930409|a|The human protein MED1 (also known as MBD4) was previously isolated in a two-hybrid screening using the mismatch repair protein MLH1 as a bait, and shown to have homology to bacterial base excision repair DNA N-glycosylases/lyases. To define the mechanisms of action of MED1, we implemented a sensitive glycosylase assay amenable to kinetic analysis. We show that MED1 functions as a mismatch-specific DNA N-glycosylase active on thymine, uracil, and 5-fluorouracil when these bases are opposite to guanine. MED1 lacks uracil glycosylase activity on single-strand DNA and abasic site lyase activity. The glycosylase activity of MED1 prefers substrates containing a G:T mismatch within methylated or unmethylated CpG sites; since G:T mismatches can originate via deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine, MED1 may act as a caretaker of genomic fidelity at CpG sites. A kinetic analysis revealed that MED1 displays a fast first cleavage reaction followed by slower subsequent reactions, resulting in biphasic time course; this is due to the tight binding of MED1 to the abasic site reaction product rather than a consequence of enzyme inactivation. Comparison of kinetic profiles revealed that the MED1 5-methylcytosine binding domain and methylation of the mismatched CpG site are not required for efficient catalysis.

7781462|t|L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway modulates gastric motility and gallbladder emptying induced by erythromycin and liquid meal in humans.
7781462|a|There is recent evidence that nitric oxide, a soluble gas produced from L-arginine, is released by the smooth muscle cells and neurons of the gastrointestinal tract where it exerts a myorelaxive action. However, little is known about the effects nitric oxide has on gastric and gallbladder motility during the inter- and postprandial phases in man. We therefore investigated the effects 200 mg/kg/hr L-arginine exerts on the gastric and gallbladder motility induced by 2 mg/kg erythromycin or a liquid meal in 21 subjects in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Gastric and gallbladder emptying were evaluated by sonography. Fasting antral motility was expressed as antral motility index (MI). In fasting subjects, L-arginine administration determined a threefold increase in plasma nitrite concentrations. Administration of erythromycin caused a significant rise in the antral MI, which was inhibited by L-arginine (P < 0.05). Ingestion of a liquid meal also significantly increased antral MI, but it returned to basal values 90 min after the end of the meal. Although L-arginine administration caused a significant reduction in the antral MI (P < 0.05), it did not inhibit gastric emptying. L-Arginine provoked an approximately 40% increase in basal gallbladder volume, completely blocked erythromycin-induced emptying, and partially, but significantly, prevented the emptying induced by a liquid meal (P < 0.01). Our study suggests that nitric oxide may be implicated in the physiological modulation of gastric and gallbladder motility during the inter- and postprandial phases in man.

6629418|t|The destruction of peripheral-blood lymphocytes by extracorporeal exposure to ultraviolet radiation.
6629418|a|Venous blood from healthy adult human donors was circulated through a wholly extracorporeal circuit for periods up to 140 min without apparent damage to the lymphocytes. However, when the blood was exposed to short-wave ultraviolet radiation (UVC; lambda, 254 nm), separated mononuclear cells showed a depressed response to mitogen stimulation: the magnitude of this effect was related to the duration of exposure. This depression cannot be attributed to change in blood pH, partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide, temperature of cell trauma. Plasma from irradiated blood was less satisfactory than non-irradiated plasma for the support of growth of phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes in culture, probably because of depletion of essential nutrients, and there was little evidence for the generation of growth-inhibitory humoral factors. The UVC-irradiated lymphocytes had normal ultrastructure when removed from the extracorporeal circuit, but underwent apoptosis and necrosis during the first day of tissue culture with or without mitogen stimulation.

7817362|t|Endothelin-1 increased immunoreactive von Willebrand factor in endothelial cells and induced micro thrombosis in rats.
7817362|a|This study was performed (i) to investigate the interaction between ET-1 and endothelial cells and (ii) to study the role of ET-1 in in vivo thrombosis. Fura-2AM loaded human umbilical endothelial cell cultures were incubated with 0, 25, 50 and 100 pmol of ET-1 for 24 hours (n = 6) at 37 degrees C. Fura-2 released in the media was measured by spectroflurophotometer at wavelength of 350 nm excitation and 500 nm emission. We found significant (p < 0.01) and dose dependent decrease in Fura-2 release by the cells indicating increased intracellular calcium in HUVEC. Increased calcium by ET-1 was also confirmed at single cell level by fluorescence digital image analysis using Fura-2AM. 5 ml solution of ET-1 (100 pmol/ml) was injected within the venous lumen of umbilical cords (of normal pregnancy) clumped at both ends and incubated at a temperature 37 degrees C for 3 hours (n = 7). We found intensely stained immunoreactive von Willebrand factor (vWF) on the endothelial cells of ET treated umbilical cords when compared with sham control (Umbilical cords incubated with phosphate buffer saline; n = 7). Intravenous ET-1 infusions at a rate of 1 nmol/kg/hour for 2 hours (cases, n = 7) and 5% dextrose infusions (sham control, n = 7) were performed in rats. Aorta, kidney and liver tissues were obtained to perform immunostaining with polyclonal antibody to vWF and fibrinogen. ET-1 treated rat tissues showed intense staining for vWF and fibrinogen intravascularly at hte same site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

3598589|t|[3H]GBR-12935 binding to the dopamine transporter is decreased in the caudate nucleus in Parkinson's disease.
3598589|a|The specific binding of [3H]GBR-12935 to membranes prepared from human caudate nucleus is saturable (Bmax 1.36 +/- 0.18 pmol/mg protein), sodium dependent and of high affinity (KD 2.34 +/- 0.18 nM). Freezing of tissue from rat brain, or refrigeration followed by freezing, results in a small but significant (less than or equal to 20%) decrease in specific [3H]GBR-12935 binding when compared to the binding observed in fresh (nonfrozen) tissue, and this decrease may account, in part, for the differences in specific binding between rat and human brain membranes. Despite small differences in binding site density between fresh and frozen tissue there is a good correlation (r = 0.98; p less than 0.01) between the potencies of a series of drugs in displacing specific [3H]GBR-12935 binding to human caudate membranes and rat striatum as well as in inhibiting dopamine uptake in rat striatal synaptosomes (r = 0.96; p less than 0.01). The specific binding of [3H]GBR-12935 to membranes prepared from the caudate nuclei of patients with Parkinson's disease is decreased compared to membranes prepared from age- and sex-matched controls. These data suggest that [3H]GBR-12935 binds in a sodium-dependent fashion to the dopamine transport complex in human brain and that specific binding is decreased by a pathological degeneration of dopaminergic neurons to the caudate nucleus.

20021004|t|DNA microarray technology in the evaluation of weight management potential of a novel calcium-potassium salt of (-)-hydroxycitric Acid.
20021004|a|Quality and quantity of diet and nutrients are key factors of human health and disease prevention. Molecular diagnostics and cellular signaling play a fundamental role in the usefulness of novel nutraceuticals and functional foods. Increasing knowledge of the genes and molecules involved in the development of obesity is creating new methods of obesity regulation. Traditional herbal medicines may have some potential in weight management. Botanical dietary supplements often contain complex mixtures of phytochemicals that have additive or synergistic interactions. Evidence from numerous human and animal dietary studies has demonstrated the potential therapeutic effects of traditional herbal medicines in controlling obesity. We analyzed the effects of low-dose oral administration of calcium-potassium salt of (-)-hydroxycitric acid (HCA-SX) on the body weight and abdominal fat transcriptome in rats. HCA-SX restricted body weight gain in rats and lowered abdominal fat leptin expression. High-density microarray analysis of 9960 genes and ESTs present in the fat tissue identified a small set of specific genes sensitive to dietary HCA-SX. Mitochondrial/nuclear proteins necessary for fundamental support of the tissue were not affected by HCA-SX, further demonstrating its safety. Functional characterization of HCA-SX sensitive genes revealed that up-regulation of genes encoding serotonin receptors represents a distinct effect of HCA-SX on appetite suppression.

15784190|t|Platelets can neutralize hydrogen peroxide in an acute toxicity model with cells involved in granulation tissue formation.
15784190|a|Platelets play a key role in the replacement of the blood clot with granulation tissue during the early steps of bone regeneration. We hypothesized that activated platelets can neutralize locally produced reactive oxygen species, thereby protecting cells involved in granulation tissue formation. The potential of platelet-released supernatant (PRS) to neutralize hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) was tested in an acute toxicity model with osteogenic, inflammatory, and endothelial cells. In the human fetal osteoblastic cell line 1.19 (hFOB), considerable morphological changes, cell shedding, and dysfunction of the respiratory chain were observed when cells were exposed to 3 mM H(2)O(2). Caspase-3 and poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase were not activated, suggesting that cell death occurred by necrosis. Preincubation of osteogenic cells, leukocytes, or endothelial cells with PRS decreased the acute toxicity of H(2)O(2). The capacity of platelets to release H(2)O(2)-detoxifying activity was retained for up to 72 h. Aminotriazole, an inhibitor of catalase, decreased the cytoprotective activity of PRS, whereas blocking of glutathione peroxidase by mercaptosuccinate had no effect. These results suggest that platelet-released catalase can rapidly neutralize cytotoxic amounts of H(2)O(2), a process that may play a role during the early stages of bone regeneration.

25470017|t|Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibition and the potential for renal protection in diabetic nephropathy.
25470017|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Renal hyperfiltration has been used as a surrogate marker for increased intraglomerular pressure in patients with diabetes mellitus. Previous human investigation examining the pathogenesis of hyperfiltration has focused on the role of neurohormones such as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Unfortunately, RAAS blockade does not completely attenuate hyperfiltration or diabetic kidney injury. More recent work has therefore investigated the contribution of renal tubular factors, including the sodium-glucose cotransporter, to the hyperfiltration state, which is the topic of this review. RECENT FINDINGS: Novel sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce proximal tubular sodium reabsorption, thereby increasing distal sodium delivery to the macula densa, causing tubuloglomerular feedback, afferent vasoconstriction and decreased hyperfiltration in animals. In humans, SGLT2 inhibition was recently shown to reduce hyperfiltration in normotensive, normoalbuminuric patients with type 1 diabetes. In clinical trials of type 2 diabetes, SGLT2 is associated with significant renal effects, including modest, acute declines in estimated glomerular filtration rate followed by the maintenance of stable renal function, and reduced albuminuria. SUMMARY: Existing data are supportive of a potential renal-protective role for SGLT2 inhibition in patients with diabetes. Dedicated renal outcome trials are ongoing and have the potential to change the clinical practice.

7738723|t|Biochemical basis for the killing of Cryptococcus neoformans by rat peritoneal cells.
7738723|a|The biochemical basis of peritoneal cell cytotoxicity for Cryptococcus neoformans was studied by measuring the killing of the yeast by peritoneal resident cells and peritoneal exudate cells obtained from normal and proteose-peptone-injected animals, respectively. Both cell populations killed C. neoformans to an equivalent extent after 3 h incubation. Exudate cells showed anti-cryptococcal activity from the first hour of incubation, while no killing was observed with resident cells before 3 h. Both cell populations triggered a respiratory burst in response to opsonized C. neoformans as indicated by the fact that killing of the yeast was inhibited by scavengers of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI). C. neoformans susceptibility to H2O2 and hydroxyl radicals in cell-free systems is demonstrated by incubating a yeast suspension with different concentrations of H2O2 and Fenton's reagents, respectively. These results suggest that oxygen metabolites play an active role in C. neoformans killing.

14993791|t|Molecular mechanism of cell death induced by the antioxidant tert-butylhydroxyanisole in human monocytic leukemia U937 cells.
14993791|a|A phenolic antioxidant 3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole (BHA) is a widely used food additive. BHA had cytotoxicity in human monocytic leukemia U937 cells. BHA at 0.75 mM caused nuclear condensation and fragmentation, structural damage in mitochondria, decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and internucleosomal DNA cleavage. It induced the activities of caspase-3 and/or -7, -6, -8 and -9, especially high when DEVD-MCA was the substrate (caspase-3 and/or -7). DEVDase activity increased in time- and dose-dependent manner and high activity was observed in lysates of cells treated for 3 h at 0.75 mM. Addition of GSH (reduced glutathione) during the treatment of cells with BHA inhibited the induction of DEVDase activity, and the intracellular GSH level decreased as the concentration of BHA was raised. Intracellular ATP levels decreased in time- and dose-dependent manner when the cells were treated with BHA in the presence or absence of glucose. Enzyme activities involved in the respiratory chain were assayed with the mitochondrial fraction prepared from U937 cells. BHA distinctly inhibited NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) at low concentrations. Succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex II) was also inhibited, but to somewhat less extent. Without mitochondrial enzymes, BHA stimulated the ubiquinol-dependent reduction of cytochrome c (complex III), but it might have some detrimental effects on the mitochondrial enzyme reaction of complex III. The inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation might corroborate the mechanistic evidence for apoptosis of leukemia cells by BHA. Cell death induced by BHA is primarily ascribable to apoptosis.

14679005|t|Coadministration of the heat shock protein 90 antagonist 17-allylamino- 17-demethoxygeldanamycin with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid or sodium butyrate synergistically induces apoptosis in human leukemia cells.
14679005|a|Interactions between the histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and sodium butyrate (SB) and the heat shock protein (Hsp) 90 antagonist 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) have been examined in human leukemia cells (U937). Coadministration of marginally toxic concentrations of 17-AAG with sublethal concentrations of SB or SAHA resulted in highly synergistic induction of mitochondrial damage (i.e., cytochrome c release), caspase-3 and -8 activation, and apoptosis. Similar interactions were noted in human promyelocytic (HL-60) and lymphoblastic (Jurkat) leukemia cells. These events were accompanied by multiple perturbations in signal transduction, cell cycle, and survival-related pathways, including early down-regulation of Raf-1, inactivation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase (MEK) 1/2, diminished expression of phospho-Akt, and late activation of c-Jun-NH(2)-terminal kinase, but no changes in expression of phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Coadministration of 17-AAG blocked SAHA-mediated induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(CIP1) and resulted in reduced expression of p27(KIP1) and p34(cdc2). 17-AAG/SAHA-treated cells also displayed down-regulation of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 and evidence of Bcl-2 cleavage. Enforced expression of doxycycline-inducible p21(CIP1) or constitutively active MEK1 significantly diminished 17-AAG/SAHA-mediated lethality, indicating that interference with ERK activation and p21(CIP1) induction play important functional roles in the lethal effects of this regimen. In contrast, enforced expression of constitutively active Akt failed to exert cytoprotective actions. Together, these findings indicate that coadministration of SAHA or SB with the Hsp90 antagonist 17-AAG in human leukemia cells leads to multiple perturbations in signaling, cell cycle, and survival pathways that culminate in mitochondrial injury and apoptosis. They also raise the possibility that combining such agents with Hsp90 antagonists may represent a novel antileukemic strategy.

10766785|t|Distinct roles for recombinant cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase-I and -II in AMP and IMP catabolism in COS-7 and H9c2 rat myoblast cell lines.
10766785|a|Catabolism of AMP during ATP breakdown produces adenosine, which restores energy balance. Catabolism of IMP may be a key step regulating purine nucleotide pools. Two, cloned cytosolic 5'-nucleotidases (cN-I and cN-II) have been implicated in AMP and IMP breakdown. To evaluate their roles directly, we expressed recombinant pigeon cN-I or human cN-II at similar activities in COS-7 or H9c2 cells. During rapid (more than 90% in 10 min) or slower (30-40% in 10 min) ATP catabolism, cN-I-transfected COS-7 and H9c2 cells produced significantly more adenosine than cN-II-transfected cells, which were similar to control-transfected cells. Inosine and hypoxanthine concentrations increased only during slower ATP catabolism. In COS-7 cells, 5'-nucleotidase activity was not rate-limiting for inosine and hypoxanthine production, which was therefore unaffected by cN-II- and actually reduced by cN-I- overexpression. In H9c2 cells, in which 5'-nucleotidase activity was rate-limiting, only cN-II overexpression accelerated inosine and hypoxanthine formation. Guanosine formation from GMP was also increased by cN-II. Our results imply distinct roles for cN-I and cN-II. Under the conditions tested in these cells, only cN-I plays a significant role in AMP breakdown to adenosine, whereas only cN-II breaks down IMP to inosine and GMP to guanosine.

12893629|t|Regulation of intestinal NaPi-IIb cotransporter gene expression by estrogen.
12893629|a|The current experiments were designed to study the effect of beta-estradiol on type IIb sodium-coupled phosphate (NaPi-IIb) cotransporter gene expression. Uptake studies with intestinal brush-border membrane vesicles (BBMV) showed that estrogen treatment increased sodium-dependent phosphate absorption by approximately 45% in rat intestine. Northern blot analysis indicated that NaPi-IIb mRNA expression was increased by approximately 50% after estrogen treatment. Western blot analysis also detected an increase in BBMV NaPi-IIb protein expression in estrogen-treated rats. In human intestinal Caco-2 cells, NaPi-IIb mRNA abundance was increased approximately 60% after estrogen treatment, and this increase could be abolished by inhibition of gene transcription. Transfection studies with human NaPi-IIb promoter reporter constructs showed that the promoter was responsive to estrogen treatment. These studies demonstrate for the first time that estrogen stimulates intestinal sodium-dependent phosphate absorption in female rats. This stimulation is associated with increased NaPi-IIb mRNA and protein expression. Thus the effect of estrogen on intestinal Pi absorption may be partially due to activation of NaPi-IIb gene transcription.

11733288|t|Tricyclic antidepressants directly depress human myocardial mechanical function independent of effects on the conduction system.
11733288|a|OBJECTIVES: To measure the effect of tricyclic antidepressant drugs (TCAs) on human myocardial contractility. METHODS: Human atrial tissue was obtained during cardiac bypass surgery. The tissue was harvested, suspended in a Tyrode buffer at 37 degrees C, and perfused with a 95%/5% oxygen-carbon dioxide mixture. Developed force was continuously measured using a force transducer and recorded by computer. After an equilibration period, escalating doses of amitriptyline or desipramine were added to the bath. All strips were exposed to the following five concentrations of each drug: 0 (control) 0.4, 4, 40, and 400 microM. The results for each experiment were expressed as the difference between the developed force measured prior to the addition of each concentration of drug and the developed force measured after a 30-minute exposure to the drug. RESULTS: Desipramine decreased the developed force by 27%, 49%, and 74% at concentrations of 0.4, 40, and 400 microM, respectively. Amitriptyline decreased the developed force by 38% at the 40-microM concentration and by 89% at the 400-microM concentration. Untreated strips retained 94% of baseline developed force at 150 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: Tricyclic antidepressants depress human myocardial function in a dose-dependent fashion independent of the effects on the cardiac conduction system. While previous work has demonstrated the effect of therapies for the reversal of impaired cardiac conduction following TCA poisoning, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no reports have documented the effects of therapy on direct myocardial depression. Additional therapies targeted at reversing the direct cardiodepressive effects of TCA may improve outcome following TCA poisoning.

10745193|t|Physiological studies in aerobic batch cultivations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains harboring the MEL1 gene.
10745193|a|Physiological studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains harboring the MEL1 gene were carried out in aerobic batch cultivations on glucose-galactose mixtures and on the disaccharide melibiose, which is hydrolyzed by the enzyme melibiase (Mel1, EC 3.2.1.22) into a glucose and a galactose moiety. The strains examined (T200, T256, M24, and TH1) were all derived from the bakers' and distillers' strain of S. cerevisiae, DGI 342. All the strains showed a significant higher ethanol yield when growing on glucose, and half the biomass yield, compared with growth on galactose. The maximum specific uptake rates were 2.5-3.3-fold higher on glucose than on galactose for all the strains examined, and hence, ethanol production was pronounced on glucose due to respiro-fermentative metabolism. The T256 strain and the T200 strain having the MEL1 gene inserted in the HXK2 locus and the LEU2 locus, respectively, hydrolyzed melibiose with low specific hydrolysis rates of 0.03 C-mol/g/h and 0.04 C-mol/g/h, respectively. This resulted in high biomass yields on melibiose in the order of 10 g/C-mol compared with 3.7 g/C-mol for M24 and 1.6 g/C-mol for TH1. The M24 strain, constructed by classical breeding, and the mig1/gal80 disrupted and melibiase-producing strain TH1, were superior in their ability to hydrolyze melibiose into glucose and galactose showing specific melibiose hydrolysis rates of 0.17 C-mol/g/h and 0.24 C-mol/g/h, respectively. Hence, high ethanol yields on melibiose were obtained with these two strains. Growth on the glucose-galactose mixtures showed a reduction of glucose control successfully obtained in the M24 strain and the TH1 strain.

26494435|t|Anaerobic ammonium oxidation and its contribution to nitrogen removal in China's coastal wetlands.
26494435|a|Over the past several decades, human activities have caused substantial enrichment of reactive nitrogen in China's coastal wetlands. Although anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), the process of oxidizing ammonium into dinitrogen gas through the reduction of nitrite, is identified as an important process for removing reactive nitrogen, little is known about the dynamics of anammox and its contribution to nitrogen removal in nitrogen-enriched environments. Here, we examine potential rates of anammox and associate them with bacterial diversity and abundance across the coastal wetlands of China using molecular and isotope tracing techniques. High anammox bacterial diversity was detected in China's coastal wetlands and included Candidatus Scalindua, Kuenenia, Brocadia, and Jettenia. Potential anammox rates were more closely associated with the abundance of anammox bacteria than to their diversity. Among all measured environmental variables, temperature was a key environmental factor, causing a latitudinal distribution of the anammox bacterial community composition, biodiversity and activity along the coastal wetlands of China. Based on nitrogen isotope tracing experiments, anammox was estimated to account for approximately 3.8-10.7% of the total reactive nitrogen removal in the study area. Combined with denitrification, anammox can remove 20.7% of the total external terrigenous inorganic nitrogen annually transported into China's coastal wetland ecosystems.

10098455|a|DNA damage induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is considered an important intermediate in the pathogenesis of human conditions such as cancer and aging. By developing an oxidative-induced DNA damage mapping version of the Ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LMPCR) technique, we investigated the il vivo and in vitro frequencies of DNA base modifications caused by ROS in the human p53 and PGK1 gene. Intact human male fibroblasts were exposed to 50mM H2O2, or purified genomic DNA was treated with 5 mM H2O2, 100 microM Ascorbate, and 50 microM, 100 microM, or 100 microM of Cu(II), Fe(II), or Cr(VI) respectively. The damage pattern generated in vivo was nearly identical to the in vitro Cu(II) or Fe(III) damage patterns; damage was non-random with guanine bases heavily damaged. Cr(VI) generated an in vitro damage pattern similar to the other metal ions, although several unique thymine positions were damaged. Also, extra nuclear sites are a major contributor of metal ions (or metal-like ligands). These data show that the local probability of H2O2-mediated DNA damage is determined by the primary DNA sequence, with chromatin structure having a limited effect. The data suggest a model in which DNA-metal ion binding domains can accommodate different metalions. LMPCR's unique aspect is a blunt-end ligation of an asymmetric double-stranded linker, permitting exponential PCR amplification. An important factor limiting the sensitivity of LMPCR is the representation of target gene DNA relative to non-targeted genes; therefore, we recently developed a method to eliminate excess non-targeted genomic DNA. Restriction enzyme-digested genomic DNA is size fractionated by Continuous Elution Electrophoresis (CEE), capturing the target sequence of interest. The amount of target DNA in the starting material for LMPCR is enriched, resulting in a stronger amplification signal. CEE provided a 24-fold increase in the signal strength attributable to strand breaks plus modified bases created by ROS in the human p53 and PGK1 genes, detected by LMPCR. We are currently taking advantage of the enhanced sensitivity of target gene-enriched LMPCR to map DNA damage induced in human breast epithelial cells exposed to non-cytotoxic concentrations of H2O2.

14648580|t|Proton high-resolution magic angle spinning NMR analysis of fresh and previously frozen tissue of human prostate.
14648580|a|The previously observed improvement in spectral resolution of tissue proton NMR with high-resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS) was speculated to be due largely to freeze-thawing artifacts resulting from tissue storage. In this study, 12 human prostate samples were analyzed on a 14.1T spectrometer at 3 degrees C, with HRMAS rates of 600 and 700 Hz. These samples were measured fresh and after they were frozen for 12-16 hr prior to thawing. The spectral linewidths measured from fresh and previously frozen samples were identical for all metabolites except citrate and acetate. The metabolite intensities of fresh and freeze-thawed samples depend on the quantification procedures used; however, in this experiment the differences of means were <30%. As expected, it was found that tissue storage impacts tissue quality for pathological analysis, and HRMAS conditions alone are not sufficiently destructive to impair pathological evaluation. Furthermore, although storage conditions affect absolute metabolite concentrations in NMR analysis, relative metabolite concentrations are less affected.

15797866|t|Blue light induces mitochondrial DNA damage and free radical production in epithelial cells.
15797866|a|Exposure of biological chromophores to ultraviolet radiation can lead to photochemical damage. However, the role of visible light, particularly in the blue region of the spectrum, has been largely ignored. To test the hypothesis that blue light is toxic to non-pigmented epithelial cells, confluent cultures of human primary retinal epithelial cells were exposed to visible light (390-550 nm at 2.8 milliwatts/cm2) for up to 6 h. A small loss of mitochondrial respiratory activity was observed at 6 h compared with dark-maintained cells, and this loss became greater with increasing time. To investigate the mechanism of cell loss, the damage to mitochondrial and nuclear genes was assessed using the quantitative PCR. Light exposure significantly damaged mitochondrial DNA at 3 h (0.7 lesion/10 kb DNA) compared with dark-maintained controls. However, by 6 h of light exposure, the number of lesions was decreased in the surviving cells, indicating DNA repair. Isolated mitochondria exposed to light generated singlet oxygen, superoxide anion, and the hydroxyl radical. Antioxidants confirmed the superoxide anion to be the primary species responsible for the mitochondrial DNA lesions. The effect of lipofuscin, a photoinducible intracellular generator of reactive oxygen intermediates, was investigated for comparison. Exposure of lipofuscin-containing cells to visible light caused an increase in both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA lesions compared with non-pigmented cells. We conclude that visible light can cause cell dysfunction through the action of reactive oxygen species on DNA and that this may contribute to cellular aging, age-related pathologies, and tumorigenesis.

27074556|t|Adaptive response to chronic mild ethanol stress involves ROS, sirtuins and changes in chromosome dosage in wine yeasts.
27074556|a|Industrial yeast strains of economic importance used in winemaking and beer production are genomically diverse and subjected to harsh environmental conditions during fermentation. In the present study, we investigated wine yeast adaptation to chronic mild alcohol stress when cells were cultured for 100 generations in the presence of non-cytotoxic ethanol concentration. Ethanol-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide signals promoted growth rate during passages that was accompanied by increased expression of sirtuin proteins, Sir1, Sir2 and Sir3, and DNA-binding transcription regulator Rap1. Genome-wide array-CGH analysis revealed that yeast genome was shaped during passages. The gains of chromosomes I, III and VI and significant changes in the gene copy number in nine functional gene categories involved in metabolic processes and stress responses were observed. Ethanol-mediated gains of YRF1 and CUP1 genes were the most accented. Ethanol also induced nucleolus fragmentation that confirms that nucleolus is a stress sensor in yeasts. Taken together, we postulate that wine yeasts of different origin may adapt to mild alcohol stress by shifts in intracellular redox state promoting growth capacity, upregulation of key regulators of longevity, namely sirtuins and changes in the dosage of genes involved in the telomere maintenance and ion detoxification.

24061560|t|Yeast copper-zinc superoxide dismutase can be activated in the absence of its copper chaperone.
24061560|a|Copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (Sod1) is an abundant intracellular enzyme that catalyzes the disproportionation of superoxide to give hydrogen peroxide and dioxygen. In most organisms, Sod1 acquires copper by a combination of two pathways, one dependent on the copper chaperone for Sod1 (CCS), and the other independent of CCS. Examples have been reported of two exceptions: Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which Sod1 appeared to be fully dependent on CCS, and Caenorhabditis elegans, in which Sod1 was completely independent of CCS. Here, however, using overexpressed Sod1, we show there is also a significant amount of CCS-independent activation of S. cerevisiae Sod1, even in low-copper medium. In addition, we show CCS-independent oxidation of the disulfide bond in S. cerevisiae Sod1. There appears to be a continuum between CCS-dependent and CCS-independent activation of Sod1, with yeast falling near but not at the CCS-dependent end.

2456950|t|Zn2+ enhances protein tyrosine kinase activity of human platelet membranes.
2456950|a|In human platelet membranes enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of certain proteins was observed when Zn2+ instead of Mg2+ or Mn2+ was used as a divalent cation for the kinase reaction. An enhanced level of phosphate incorporation into tyrosine residues occurred into a 68 kDa polypeptide besides the 45 kDa and 105 kDa proteins. Preincubation of platelet membranes with TBR-IgG showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of the phosphorylation of the 45, 68 and 105 kDa proteins. Moreover, pp60c-src, representing the major protein tyrosine kinase activity in platelets, was found to be stimulated by Zn2+. The data, thus, support the assumption that pp60c-src kinase is responsible for Zn2+ stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation.

20484742|t|GCM1 regulation of the expression of syncytin 2 and its cognate receptor MFSD2A in human placenta.
20484742|a|Syncytin 2 is a newly identified placental membrane protein with fusogenic and immunosuppressive activities. Major facilitator superfamily domain containing 2A (MFSD2A) is the cognate receptor for syncytin 2-mediated cell-cell fusion. Both syncytin 2 and MFSD2A are highly expressed in placenta. In this study to understand the regulation of syncytin 2 and MFSD2A expression in placenta, we found that syncytin 2 gene is epigenetically silenced in nonplacental cells by cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) dinucleotide methylation and that expression of syncytin 2 and MFSD2A genes are regulated by the placental transcription factor GCM1 in placental cells. Functional GCM1-binding sites were identified in syncytin 2 and MFSD2A promoters based on electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Because GCM1 activity is decreased in hypoxic placental cells, we further confirmed that expression of MFSD2A is downregulated in hypoxic BeWo choriocarcinoma cells. Interestingly, ectopic expression of GCM1 activated syncytin 2 and MFSD2A expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and facilitated MCF-7 cell fusion. The expression of syncytin 2 in MCF-7 cells was partly attributed to CpG demethylation in the syncytin 2 promoter in the presence of GCM1. Our results suggest that GCM1 is a critical factor in controlling placental cell fusion through transcriptional regulation of syncytin 2 and MFSD2A gene expression in placenta. In addition, GCM1 may also play an important role in the epigenetic regulation of syncytin 2 gene expression.

1867224|t|Epidemiologic and clinical aspects of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia.
1867224|a|Epidemiologic studies have shown that insulin is a risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). Clinical studies have also demonstrated positive correlations between insulin and blood pressure, triglycerides, total cholesterol, fibrinogen, and plasminogen activator inhibitor. Moreover, there is an inverse correlation between insulin and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). These studies have provided evidence in support of the biologic plausibility of epidemiologic observations, but they have not clearly established insulin's role in the pathogenesis of human cardiovascular diseases (CVD) such as hypertension. In fact, there is considerable evidence that insulin resistance (abnormal nonoxidative glucose disposal), not hyperinsulinemia, is the primary insulin-related abnormality in human hypertension, and that hyperinsulinemia occurs as a response to insulin resistance. Skeletal muscle appears to be the primary site of insulin resistance in essential hypertension, although other organs, such as the kidneys and liver--key sites for cell and water homeostasis and lipoprotein regulation, respectively--may respond normally to insulin. Adipocytes also appear to be a site of insulin resistance. Thus, the putative interrelationship between hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, on the one hand, and with blood pressure and lipoproteins, on the other, is a complex one and may involve organ-specific insulin resistance. Altered cation transport is one of several mechanisms by which insulin resistance might raise blood pressure. The Na+, K(+)-ATPase and Ca(2+)-ATPase pumps are insulin sensitive. Thus, when insulin resistance is present, the activity of these pumps in the smooth muscle of the arterial wall might be reduced. This would lead to an intracellular accumulation of sodium and calcium, thereby sensitizing the vascular wall to pressor substances. Moreover, secondary hyperinsulinemia will occur, and insulin has been shown to stimulate sympathetic nervous system activity and to increase renal tubular absorption of sodium. Insulin is also a growth factor and therefore might have a trophic effect on the vessel wall, one that could initiate and/or sustain hypertension as well as atherosclerosis. Abnormal lipoprotein metabolism is yet another possible explanation for the accelerated atherosclerosis that has been observed in persons with abnormal carbohydrate tolerance and insulin resistance. Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance both play a role in the expression of elevated very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels as well as in the depression of HDL levels. Coronary risk reduction has been disappointing when blood pressure has been lowered with treatment regimens based on thiazide diuretics and/or beta blockers. Thiazides and some beta blockers may further impair tissue insulin sensitivity and often cause blood lipoprotein abnormalities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

14524677|t|Advanced oxidation of biologically pretreated Baker's Yeast Industry effluents for high recalcitrant COD and color removal.
14524677|a|The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of chemical oxidation by applying ozonation, ozonation with hydrogen peroxide and Fenton's processes for decolorization and residual COD removal of biologically pretreated baker's yeast industry (BYI) effluents. Baker's yeast industry effluents characterizing with high COD, TKN, dark color, and non-biodegradable organic pollutants. The batch tests were performed to determine the optimum operating conditions including pH, O3, H2O2, and FeSO4 dosages, molar ratio of Fe2+/H2O2 and reaction time. It was noticed that H2O2 significantly reduced the reaction times for the same ozone dosages: however, COD and color removals were not remarkable. In the Fenton's oxidation studies, the removal efficiencies of COD and color for 30 min reaction time for three different types of BYI effluents were found about 86 and 92%, respectively. Experimental results of the presented study have clearly indicated that the Fenton's oxidation technology is capable to fate almost all parts of the organics which consist of both soluble initial and microbial inert fractions of COD for baker's yeast effluents. Effluents from the Fenton's oxidation process can satisfy effluent standards for COD and color in general.

19651182|t|Safety evaluation of highly-branched cyclic dextrin and a 1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme from Bacillus stearothermophilus.
19651182|a|Highly-branched cyclic dextrin (HBCD), a dextrin food ingredient presently only used in Japan, was investigated for digestibility and potential toxicity. HBCD was readily hydrolyzed in vitro to maltose and maltotriose by human salivary and porcine pancreatic alpha-amylases. Incubation of HBCD with a rat intestinal homogenate, containing digestive enzymes, resulted in the formation of maltose, maltotriose, and maltotetraose, and with longer incubation times, resulted in the formation of glucose. In an acute toxicity study, Wistar rats orally administered a single-dose of 2000mg/kg body weight of HBCD did not display mortality or any signs or symptoms of toxicity or abnormalities upon necropsy. Transient loose stools were observed, but were resolved within 24h of HBCD administration, and therefore, were not considered as compound-specific adverse effects. In the Ames assay, HBCD was non-mutagenic with or without metabolic activation. Toxicity testing of the branching enzyme (BE) involved in the synthesis of HBCD showed that the BE also was not acutely toxic when orally administered to rats and was non-mutagenic in the mouse lymphoma assay. The results of this study demonstrate that HBCD is digested to normal and safe products of carbohydrate digestion, and therefore, support the safety of HBCD for human consumption.

26156706|t|Redox engineering by ectopic expression of glutamate dehydrogenase genes links NADPH availability and NADH oxidation with cold growth in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
26156706|a|BACKGROUND: Cold stress reduces microbial growth and metabolism being relevant in industrial processes like wine making and brewing. Knowledge on the cold transcriptional response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggests the need of a proper redox balance. Nevertheless, there are no direct evidence of the links between NAD(P) levels and cold growth and how engineering of enzymatic reactions requiring NAD(P) may be used to modify the performance of industrial strains at low temperature. RESULTS: Recombinant strains of S. cerevisiae modified for increased NADPH- and NADH-dependent Gdh1 and Gdh2 activity were tested for growth at low temperature. A high-copy number of the GDH2-encoded glutamate dehydrogenase gene stimulated growth at 15°C, while overexpression of GDH1 had detrimental effects, a difference likely caused by cofactor preferences. Indeed, neither the Trp(-) character of the tested strains, which could affect the synthesis of NAD(P), nor changes in oxidative stress susceptibility by overexpression of GDH1 and GDH2 account for the observed phenotypes. However, increased or reduced NADPH availability by knock-out or overexpression of GRE3, the NADPH-dependent aldose reductase gene, eliminated or exacerbated the cold-growth defect observed in YEpGDH1 cells. We also demonstrated that decreased capacity of glycerol production impairs growth at 15 but not at 30°C and that 15°C-grown baker's yeast cells display higher fermentative capacity than those cultivated at 30°C. Thus, increasing NADH oxidation by overexpression of GDH2 would help to avoid perturbations in the redox metabolism induced by a higher fermentative/oxidative balance at low temperature. Finally, it is shown that overexpression of GDH2 increases notably the cold growth in the wine yeast strain QA23 in both standard growth medium and synthetic grape must. CONCLUSIONS: Redox constraints limit the growth of S. cerevisiae at temperatures below the optimal. An adequate supply of NAD(P) precursors as well as a proper level of reducing equivalents in the form of NADPH are required for cold growth. However, a major limitation is the increased need of oxidation of NADH to NAD(+) at low temperature. In this scenario, our results identify the ammonium assimilation pathway as a target for the genetic improvement of cold growth in industrial strains.

24572256|t|Monoamine oxidase is a major determinant of redox balance in human atrial myocardium and is associated with postoperative atrial fibrillation.
24572256|a|BACKGROUND: Onset of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is a common and costly complication of heart surgery despite major improvements in surgical technique and quality of patient care. The etiology of POAF, and the ability of clinicians to identify and therapeutically target high-risk patients, remains elusive. METHODS AND RESULTS: Myocardial tissue dissected from right atrial appendage (RAA) was obtained from 244 patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation from multiple sources was assessed in this tissue, along with total glutathione (GSHt) and its related enzymes GSH-peroxidase (GPx) and GSH-reductase (GR). Monoamine oxidase (MAO) and NADPH oxidase were observed to generate ROS at rates 10-fold greater than intact, coupled mitochondria. POAF risk was significantly associated with MAO activity (Quartile 1 [Q1]: adjusted relative risk [ARR]=1.0; Q2: ARR=1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.84 to 4.0; Q3: ARR=2.1, 95% CI=0.99 to 4.3; Q4: ARR=3.8, 95% CI=1.9 to 7.5; adjusted Ptrend=0.009). In contrast, myocardial GSHt was inversely associated with POAF (Quartile 1 [Q1]: adjusted relative risk [ARR]=1.0; Q2: ARR=0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.60 to 1.4; Q3: ARR=0.62, 95% CI=0.36 to 1.1; Q4: ARR=0.56, 95% CI=0.34 to 0.93; adjusted Ptrend=0.014). GPx also was significantly associated with POAF; however, a linear trend for risk was not observed across increasing levels of the enzyme. GR was not associated with POAF risk. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that MAO is an important determinant of redox balance in human atrial myocardium, and that this enzyme, in addition to GSHt and GPx, is associated with an increased risk for POAF. Further investigation is needed to validate MAO as a predictive biomarker for POAF, and to explore this enzyme's potential role in arrhythmogenesis.

8631738|t|Phosphorylation of Munc-18/n-Sec1/rbSec1 by protein kinase C: its implication in regulating the interaction of Munc-18/n-Sec1/rbSec1 with syntaxin.
8631738|a|Munc-18/n-Sec1/rbSec1 interacts with syntaxin and this interaction inhibits the association of vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)/synaptobrevin and synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) with syntaxin. Syntaxin, VAMP, and SNAP-25 serve as soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein (SNAP) receptors essential for docking and/or fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane. Genetic analyses in yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila suggest that Munc-18 is essential for vesicle transport. On the other hand, protein kinase C (PKC) stimulates Ca2+-dependent exocytosis in various types of secretory cells. However, the modes of action of Munc-18 and PKC in vesicle transport have not been clarified. Here, we show that recombinant Munc-18 is phosphorylated by conventional PKC in a Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent manner in a cell-free system. About 1 mol of phosphate is maximally incorporated into 1 mol of Munc-18. The major phosphorylation sites are Ser306 and Ser313. The Munc-18 complexed with syntaxin is not phosphorylated. The PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation of Munc-18 inhibits its interaction with syntaxin. These results suggest that the PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation of Munc-18 plays an important role in regulating the interaction of Munc-18 with syntaxin and thereby the docking and/or the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane.

26931503|t|Temperature-dependent impact of thermal aminolaevulinic acid photodynamic therapy on apoptosis and reactive oxygen species generation in human dermal fibroblasts.
26931503|a|BACKGROUND: Actinic keratoses (AKs) are generally accepted as common precursor lesions to invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a common, in-office, field therapy modality used in the treatment of AKs. Clinical and laboratory observations have demonstrated that temperature modulation can affect PDT efficacy. OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate thermal PDT increases apoptotic cell death, and to investigate the mechanistic role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) free radicals in an in vitro human skin fibroblast model. METHODS: This study was completed using commercially available primary human skin fibroblasts treated with aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) at specific concentrations and controlled temperatures. Cell death, apoptosis and superoxide ROS levels were quantified. RESULTS: We found that thermal PDT with 0·5 mmol L(-1) ALA resulted in significant temperature-dependent increases in total apoptosis and superoxide ROS generation between 33 °C and 42 °C. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that thermal PDT significantly increases apoptotic cell death through increased generation of superoxide ROS in a temperature-dependent manner.

3880740|t|Radiometric analysis of oxidative reactions in aromatization by placental microsomes. Presence of differential isotope effects.
3880740|a|In order to study the initial as well as the final steps in the aromatization of androgens to estrogens, high-specific activity [19-C3H3]androstenedione and testosterone were synthesized. Incubations of [19-C3H3]androstenedione with human placental microsomes resulted in the generation of [3H]water, as a result of the dual hydroxylation at C-19, and [3H]formic acid reflecting final aromatization. After an initial lag in the production of [3H]formic acid, the two radiolabeled products were formed linearly with time at a ratio of 2 to 1 under subsaturating conditions and 2.2 to 1 when saturating levels of substrate were present. Incubation of a mixture of [19-C3H3]- and [4-14C]androstenedione with human placental microsomes yielded 19-hydroxy- and 19-oxoandrostenedione, respectively, products of one and two hydroxylations at C-19. The isotope ratios of these derivatives revealed the presence of a tritium isotope effect in the first but not in the second hydroxylation at that site. When [19-C3H2]- and [4-14C]19-hydroxyandrostenedione were used as the substrate, the isotope ratio of the isolated 19-oxoandrostenedione showed no evidence of any isotope effect in its formation. Thus, the second hydroxylation at C-19 exhibits no isotope effect irrespective of whether androstenedione or 19-hydroxyandrostenedione are the substrates, and therefore, a concerted process and catalytic commitment are not responsible for the difference in isotope effects between the first and second C-19 hydroxylation by the placental aromatase complex. Radiometric kinetic analysis employing [19-C3H3]- and [1 beta,2 beta-3H]androstenedione as the comparative substrates provided evidence that the isotope effect is exerted solely through the Vmax component of the reaction. The distinction between the successive hydroxylations at C-19 in the aromatization sequence suggests, but does not prove, that different mechanisms, and hence different catalytic sites, may be involved in these steps.

15677770|t|Regulated hydrogen peroxide production by Duox in human airway epithelial cells.
15677770|a|Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) is found in exhaled breath and is produced by airway epithelia. In addition, H(2)O(2) is a necessary substrate for the airway lactoperoxidase (LPO) anti-infection system. To investigate the source of H(2)O(2) produced by airway epithelia, PCR was used to screen nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase expression in human airway epithelia redifferentiated at the air-liquid interface (ALI) and demonstrated the presence of Duox1 and 2. Western blots of culture extracts indicated strong expression of Duox, and immunohistochemistry of human tracheal sections localized the protein to the apical portion of epithelial cells. Apical H(2)O(2) production was stimulated by 100 microM ATP or 1 microM thapsigargin, but not 100 microM ADP. Diphenyleneiodonium, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, and dimethylthiourea, a reactive oxygen species scavenger, both inhibited this stimulation. ATP did not stimulate the basolateral H(2)O(2) production by ALI cultures. ATP and thapsigargin increased intracellular Ca(2+) with kinetics similar to increasing H(2)O(2) production, and thus consistent with the expected Ca(2+) sensitivity of Duox. These data suggest that Duox is the major NADPH oxidase expressed in airway epithelia and therefore a contributor of H(2)O(2) production in the airway lumen. In addition, the data suggest that extracellular H(2)O(2) production may be regulated by stimuli that raise intracellular Ca(2+).

17949243|t|Some endocrine traits of transgenic rabbits. I. Changes in plasma and milk hormones.
17949243|a|The aim of these studies was to compare some endocrine and non-endocrine characteristics of transgenic (carrying mammary gland-specific mWAP-hFVIII gene construct) and non-transgenic rabbits. The concentrations of corticosterone, progesterone, testosterone, estradiol, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and human factor VIII (hFVIII) in the blood plasma of adult females (9 months of age, third generation transgenic animals), adult males, and young females (1-2 months of age, fourth generation of transgenic animals), as well as in the milk of lactating adult females, were analyzed by using RIA. In addition, litter size and body mass of pups born by transgenic and non-transgenic females from the third generation were compared. Transgenic animals were compared with their non-transgenic siblings (the same genetic and epigenetic background). Transgenesis did not influence plasma hFVIII, but significantly increased corticosterone (in all animals), reduced IGF-I (in adult males and females), testosterone and estradiol, (in young females) and altered progesterone (increase in adult males and decrease in adult females) concentrations in blood plasma. In addition, transgenic females had higher milk concentrations of testosterone, but not progesterone or IGF-I than their non-transgenic sisters. These endocrine changes were not associated with changes in litter size. Transgenic male (but not female) pups have smaller body mass than control animals. These observations demonstrate the influence of transgenesis per se on the animal growth and endocrine system (secretion of reproductive and stress steroid hormones as well as growth factors) over four generations.

2886147|t|Biochemical and ultrastructural alterations accompany the anti-proliferative effect of butyrate on melanoma cells.
2886147|a|The effect of sodium butyrate on mouse and human melanoma cell lines was evaluated. Sodium butyrate (0.1-2mM) is shown to reduce the clonogenic potential of several melanoma cell lines. The antiproliferative effect of sodium butyrate is accompanied by a marked increase in the activity of the plasma-membrane bound enzyme gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. Sodium butyrate treated cells acquire a well developed rough endoplasmic reticulum and accumulate fat droplets. The development of the endoplasmic reticulum is associated with a marked increase in the activity of the enzyme marker NADPH cytochrome c reductase. It is suggested that the phenotypic alterations induced by sodium butyrate may serve as markers for the action of this agent on melanoma cells and other tumours.

14505164|t|Effect of phosphate concentration on the production of dextransucrase by Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B512F.
14505164|a|Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B512F is the main strain used in industrial fermentations to produce dextransucrase and dextran. This process has been studied since the Second World War, when it was used as blood plasma expander. A study about the effect of phosphate concentration on cell propagation in a semicontinuous shake-flask culture is described in this work. Dextransucrase is obtained by fermentation of the Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B512F in the presence of sucrose as substrate, a nitrogen source (corn liquor or yeast extract) and minerals. Phosphate is currently used in order to buffer the culture medium. Cell propagation can be done through a repeated batch culture, where dilution in a fresh medium is made with relatively short periods. The standard medium for dextransucrase production is prepared using 0.1 M of K(2)HPO(4). In this work the level of phosphate was increased to 0.3 M, and an increase on biomass and on the enzyme activity was found when phosphate enriched medium was used. Higher phosphate buffer concentration was also able to keep the pH values above 5.0 during the entire process, avoiding enzyme denaturation.

18468509|t|NADPH oxidase activation is required for migration by LIGHT in human monocytes.
18468509|a|Homologous to lymphotoxins, shows inducible expression, and competes with herpes simplex virus (HSV) glycoprotein D (gD) for herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM; TR2) (LIGHT), a ligand of herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM), increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhanced the destruction of bacteria in human monocytes. In this study, rhLIGHT was found to increase the expression of the chemokine receptors, chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1) and CCR2, as well as to accelerate the migration activity of human monocytes. Additionally, rhLIGHT was found to increase ROS via NADPH oxidase p47(phox) phosphorylation, which was found to be required for LIGHT-induced NF-kappaB activation, CCR1 and CCR2 expression, migration and IL-8 and TNF-alpha production. Taken together, these results indicate that NADPH oxidase activation is required for rhLIGHT-induced migration in human monocytes.

10090234|t|The molecular and ionic specificity of antiarrhythmic drug actions.
10090234|a|Virtually all clinical antiarrhythmic agents act by reducing ion channel conductance, with sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), and calcium (Ca++) channels the primary targets. Na+ channel blockers increase the risk of ischemic ventricular fibrillation and are relatively contraindicated in the presence of active coronary heart disease. Ca++ channel blockers suppress AV nodal conduction and are used to terminate reentrant supraventricular arrhythmias and control the ventricular response to atrial fibrillation. K+ channels constitute the most diverse group of cardiac ion channels. They are the primary targets of Class III antiarrhythmic drugs, the category of such agents presently undergoing the most active development. The rapid delayed rectifier, IKr, plays a key role in repolarization of all cardiac tissues and is the most common (and often only) target of action potential-prolonging drugs. Unfortunately, because of the ubiquity of IKr and the reverse use-dependent action potential prolongation that results from blocking it, IKr blockers are likely to cause torsades de pointes ventricular proarrhythmia. K+ channel blockers, such as amiodarone and azimilide, that affect the slow delayed rectifier IKs as well as IKr, appear to produce a more desirable rate-dependent profile of Class III action. Recently, much has been learned about the molecular basis of K+ channels based on their role in the congenital long QT syndrome. The availability of molecular clones that encode many of the channels in the human heart allows for the rapid screening of many potential new drugs, making possible the development of "designer" antiarrhythmic drugs with specific profiles of channel-blocking selectivity.

11034042|t|Hemodynamic and cardiovascular effects of nitric oxide modulation in the therapy of septic shock.
11034042|a|Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) of the inducible subtype (iNOS) plays a pivotal role in vasodilation associated with sepsis. Various biochemical pathways are involved, revealing targets for inhibiting the consequence of iNOS activation. Interactions of transcription factors, inducers, cofactors, and regulators of iNOS are important in understanding the development of iNOS inhibitors. Inhibition through L-arginine analogs, depletion of arginine, inhibition of cofactors, modulating gene transcription, and scavenging nitric oxide have been studied. Human studies were conducted only with nonselective L-arginine analogs. Reduction of mortality from sepsis was not reported. It is anticipated that iNOS-specific compounds will be clinically useful. The focus of future human trials will be on these agents. Although ideal therapy for treating vasodilation from sepsis is not available, research into the pathophysiology of NOS in sepsis clarified the complexities surrounding this therapeutic dilemma.

1156368|t|Evidence for two asymmetric conformational states in the human erythrocyte sugar-transport system.
1156368|a|6-O-methyl-, 6-O-propyl-, 6-O-pentyl- and 6-O-benzyl-D-galactose, and 6-O-methyl-, 6-O-propyl- and 6-O-pentyl-D-glucose inhibit the glucose-transport system of the human erythrocyte when added to the external medium. Penetration of 6-O-methyl-D-galactose is inhibited by D-glucose, suggesting that it is transported by the glucose-transport system, but the longer-chain 6-O-alkyl-D-galactoses penetrate by a slower D-glucose-insensitive route at rates proportional to their olive oil/water partition coefficients. 6-O-n-Propyl-D-glucose and 6-O-n-propyl-D-galactose do not significantly inhibit L-sorbose entry or D-glucose exit when present only on the inside of the cells whereas propyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside, which also penetrates the membrane slowly by a glucose-insensitive route, only inhibits L-sorbose entry or D-glucose exit when present inside the cells, and not when on the outside. The 6-O-alkyl-D-galactoses, like the other nontransported C-4 and C-6 derivatives, maltose and 4,6-O-ethylidene-D-glucose, protect against fluorodinitrobenzene inactivation, whereas propyl beta-D-glucopyranoside stimulates the inactivation. Of the transported sugars tested, those modified at C-1, C-2 and C-3 enhance fluorodinitrobenzene inactivation, where those modified at C-4 and C-6 do not, but are inert or protect against inactivation. An asymmetric mechanism is proposed with two conformational states in which the sugar binds to the transport system so that C-4 and C-6 are in contact with the solvent on the outside and C-1 is in contact with the solvent on the inside of the cell. It is suggested that fluorodinitrobenzene reacts with the form of the transport system that binds sugars at the inner side of the membrane. An Appendix describes the theoretical basis of the experimental methods used for the determination of kinetic constants for non-permeating inhibitors.

2684277|t|Studies on the degradative mechanism of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase from yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
2684277|a|Previous work carried out in our laboratory (Burlini, N., Lamponi S., Radrizzani, M., Monti, E. and Tortora P. (1987) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 930, 220-229) led to the immunological identification of a yeast 65-kDa phosphoprotein as a modified form of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; moreover the appearance of this phospho form was proven to be independent of cAMP, whereas the glucose-induced inactivation of the native enzyme is cAMP-dependent. Here, we report further investigations on the mechanism of the glucose-triggered degradation of the enzyme which led to the following results: (a) the aforementioned phospho form displayed a binding pattern to 5 AMP-Sepharose 4B quite similar to that of native enzyme, although it did not retain its oligomeric structure, nor was it catalytically active; (b) its phosphate content was of about two residues per monomer; (c) its isoelectric point was slightly higher than that of native enzyme, this shows that the enzyme undergoes additional modifications besides phosphorylation; (d) it represented about 4% of the native enzyme in glucose-depressed cells; (e) other forms immunologically cross-reactive with the native enzyme were also isolated, whose molecular mass was in the range of 60-62 kDa, and they are probable candidates as degradation products of the phospho form; (f) time courses of the native and phospho forms in the presence and the absence of glucose provided data consistent with a kinetic model involving a strong stimulation of the decay of both forms effected by the sugar; (g) in the mutant ABYS1 (Achstetter, T., Emter, O., Ehmann, C. and Wolf, D.H. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 13334-13343) which is devoid of the four major vacuolar proteinases, the decay pattern was essentially the same as in wild-type; (h) effectors lowering intracellular ATP also retarded the first step of enzyme degradation; this points to an ATP-dependence of this step. Based on these results we propose a degradation mechanism consisting of an initial cAMP- and ATP-dependent modification of the enzyme, followed by a cAMP-independent phosphorylation, which leads to the appearance of the aforementioned monomeric phospho form; this in turn seems to undergo limited proteolysis. These data strongly suggest the occurrence of an intermediate form arising from the native one and whose phosphorylation gives rise to the 65-kDa phosphoprotein described here.

6477898|t|K+-valinomycin and chloride conductance of the human red cell membrane. Influence of the membrane protonophore carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone.
6477898|a|Chloride ion conductance of the human red cell membrane has been calculated, as the ratio between ion net charge flux and driving potential. The proton carrier CCCP was used to monitor changes in membrane potential following addition of valinomycin in sufficient quantities to raise the K+ conductance to a level comparable to the Cl- conductance. A K+-specific electrode was used to monitor changes in extracellular K+ concentration, and an H+-sensitive glass electrode for changes in extracellular pH, reflecting changes in membrane potential. The effects of varied concentrations of valinomycin and CCCP upon K+ and Cl- conductances were studied. It was found that, within an experimental error of about 10% S.D., the chloride conductance was constant for valinomycin concentrations in the range 1.0 X 10(-8)-1.0 X 10(-6), and for CCCP-concentrations in the range 2.0 X 10(-7)-2.0 X 10(-5) mol per litre cell suspension, while at a constant concentration of valinomycin the induced K+ conductance was considerably augmented by addition of CCCP.

8869419|t|Human erythrocyte choline uptake in uraemia: the role of intracellular substrate and an investigation into the effects of haemodialysis.
8869419|a|1. Erythrocyte choline transport was studied in 10 haemodialysis patients immediately before and after a haemodialysis session and in 10 control subjects. Choline uptake was measured in erythrocytes from normal and uraemic patients after washing in vitro and subsequent incubation in autologous plasma. Amines present in uraemic plasma were examined for their effect on choline transport in normal erythrocytes. 2. NMR spectroscopy was used to measure choline, trimethylamine and dimethylamine in erythrocyte extracts from nine control subjects, 32 subjects with renal impairment and nine samples from haemodialysis patients. 3. The increased choline influx in uraemic erythrocytes is significantly decreased by prior haemodialysis (mean Vmax pre-dialysis 146 +/- 20 mumol h-1 l-1, post-dialysis 113 +/- 13 mumol h-1 l-1 (P < 0.005). After in vitro washing there is a fall in Vmax, and no longer any significant difference between pre- and post-dialysis samples. There remains a significant difference in the erythrocyte choline Vmax between samples from patients with chronic renal failure and from normal subjects (P < 0.005). 4. Human plasma was found to contain factors capable of increasing choline uptake. Trimethylamine and dimethylamine were found to inhibit choline uptake. Trimethylamine and trimethylamine-N-oxide trans-stimulated choline efflux, but the major transport substrate present in erythrocyte extracts from all groups was choline, which was higher in those with renal impairment (71 +/- 10 mumol/l) than in haemodialysis patients (47 +/- 10 mumol/l) and control subjects with normal renal function (40 +/- 9 mumol/l). 5. Our data suggest that erythrocyte choline transport is increased in uraemia as a consequence of increased transporter number or activity, rather than the presence of intracellular substrate.

20074931|t|Red wine polyphenols cause growth inhibition and apoptosis in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells by inducing a redox-sensitive up-regulation of p73 and down-regulation of UHRF1.
20074931|a|Several epidemiological studies suggest that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, which contain high levels of polyphenols, is associated with a reduced risk of cancer. The aim of the present study was to determine whether a red wine polyphenolic extract (RWPs, a rich source of polyphenols; 2.9g/L) affects the proliferation of human lymphoblastic leukaemia cells (Jurkat cells) and, if so, to determine the underlying mechanism. Cell proliferation and viability were determined by the MTS and trypan blue exclusion assays, respectively. Cell cycle analysis, apoptosis activity and oxidative stress levels were assessed by flow cytometry, and the expression of p73, UHRF1 and active caspase-3 by Western blot analysis. RWPs inhibited the proliferation of Jurkat cells and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, RWPs triggered apoptosis, which is associated with an increased expression level of the pro-apoptotic protein p73 and the active caspase-3. RWPs induced apoptosis confirmed by DNA fragmentation analysis, and this effect was associated with down-regulation of the antiapoptotic protein UHRF1. Furthermore RWPs significantly increased the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Intracellular scavengers of superoxide anions (MnTMPyP, MnTBAP, PEG-SOD) prevented the RWPs-induced formation of ROS and apoptosis, while native extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD) was without effect. In addition, the effect of RWPs on the expression levels of p73, active caspase-3 and UHRF1 was also prevented by MnTMPyP. Thus, these findings indicate that RWPs induce apoptosis in Jurkat cells by a redox-sensitive mechanism involving the intracellular formation of superoxide anions and consequently the up-regulation of p73 and down-regulation of UHRF1.

24485196|t|Alu elements shape the primate transcriptome by cis-regulation of RNA editing.
24485196|a|BACKGROUND: RNA editing by adenosine to inosine deamination is a widespread phenomenon, particularly frequent in the human transcriptome, largely due to the presence of inverted Alu repeats and their ability to form double-stranded structures--a requisite for ADAR editing. While several hundred thousand editing sites have been identified within these primate-specific repeats, the function of Alu-editing has yet to be elucidated. RESULTS: We show that inverted Alu repeats, expressed in the primate brain, can induce site-selective editing in cis on sites located several hundred nucleotides from the Alu elements. Furthermore, a computational analysis, based on available RNA-seq data, finds that site-selective editing occurs significantly closer to edited Alu elements than expected. These targets are poorly edited upon deletion of the editing inducers, as well as in homologous transcripts from organisms lacking Alus. Sequences surrounding sites near edited Alus in UTRs, have been subjected to a lesser extent of evolutionary selection than those far from edited Alus, indicating that their editing generally depends on cis-acting Alus. Interestingly, we find an enrichment of primate-specific editing within encoded sequence or the UTRs of zinc finger-containing transcription factors. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a model whereby primate-specific editing is induced by adjacent Alu elements that function as recruitment elements for the ADAR editing enzymes. The enrichment of site-selective editing with potentially functional consequences on the expression of transcription factors indicates that editing contributes more profoundly to the transcriptomic regulation and repertoire in primates than previously thought.

8698402|t|2-DG induced modulation of chromosomal DNA profile, cell survival, mutagenesis and gene conversion in X-irradiated yeast.
8698402|a|Effects of post-irradiation modulation in presence of 2-deoxy-D-glucose and yeast extract, on chromosomal DNA profile, cell survival, reverse mutation (ILV+) and gene conversion (TRP+), were studied in X-irradiated stationary phase yeast cells (diploid strain D7 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The damage and repair in chromosomal DNA bands, resolved by using contour clamped homogeneous electric pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) technique, was estimated by calculating intensity ratio, rho n (rho n I(n)/I(t); where I(n) is the intensity of nth band in a lane and I(t) is the sum of intensities of all bands and the well in the lane). The data indicate linear correlation between relative compactness (tau) of a chromosome [chromosome size (Kb)/length of synaptonemal complex (microns)] and DNA damage and repair. The chromosome repair kinetics were biphasic, showing initial decrease followed by an increase in rho n. Variations were observed among different chromosomes with respect to DNA damage, repair and post-irradiation repair modulation. 2-DG inhibited both components of chromosomal DNA repair and also repair of potentially lethal damage but enhanced frequencies of mutants. Relatively the effects on revertants were greater in cells irradiated with lower doses (50 Gy) of X-rays and post-irradiation incubation in presence of phosphate buffer having 2-DG (50 mM) and glucose (10 mM). Yeast extract increased frequencies of revertants and convertants thus promoting error-prone DNA repair. Yeast extract in combination with 2-DG showed complex effects on chromosomal DNA repair and enhanced mutagenesis further.

12675615|t|Fed-batch cultivation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a hyperbaric bioreactor.
12675615|a|Fed-batch is the dominating mode of operation in high-cell-density cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisae in processes such as the production of baker's yeast and recombinant proteins, where the high oxygen demand of these cultures makes its supply an important and difficult task. The aim of this work was to study the use of hyperbaric air for oxygen mass transfer improvement on S. cerevisiae fed-batch cultivation. The effects of increased air pressure up to 1.5 MPa on cell behavior were investigated. The effects of oxygen and carbon dioxide were dissociated from the effects of total pressure by the use of pure oxygen and gas mixtures enriched with CO(2). Fed-batch experiments were performed in a stirred tank reactor with a 600 mL stainless steel vessel. An exponential feeding profile at dilution rates up to 0.1 h(-)(1) was used in order to ensure a subcritical flux of substrate and, consequently, to prevent ethanol formation due to glucose excess. The ethanol production observed at atmospheric pressure was reduced by the bioreactor pressurization up to 1.0 MPa. The maximum biomass yield, 0.5 g g(-)(1) (cell mass produced per mass of glucose consumed) was attained whenever pressure was increased gradually through time. This demonstrates the adaptive behavior of the cells to the hyperbaric conditions. This work proved that hyperbaric air up to 1.0 MPa (0.2 MPa of oxygen partial pressure) could be applied to S. cerevisiae cultivation under low glucose flux. Above that critical oxygen partial pressure value, i.e., for oxygen pressures of 0.32 and 0.5 MPa, a drastic cell growth inhibition and viability loss were observed. The increase of carbon dioxide partial pressure in the gas mixture up to 48 kPa slightly decreased the overall cell mass yield but had negligible effects on cell viability.

24631636|t|New insights into the advantages of ammonium as a winemaking nutrient.
24631636|a|Nitrogen limitation is the most common cause for stuck or sluggish fermentation in winemaking, and it is usually dealt with by supplementing grape juice with either ammonium salts or organic nutrients. These practices have a direct impact on both fermentation kinetics and the sensorial features of the final product. The aim of this work is to provide a detailed characterization of yeast physiology in response to ammonium supplementation during alcoholic fermentation. This is done by determining changes in metabolic rates on a high frequency basis, as a sensitive way to detect the impact of fermentation conditions on yeast physiology. Our results indicate that the choice of supplementation strategy has an impact on several enological parameters like fermentation length, volatile acidity, final glycerol content, and aroma profile. Interestingly, a higher proportion of ammonium relates with improved glycerol and volatile acidity, for the same global yeast assimilable nitrogen content. However, ammonium over-supplementation has a negative impact on quality related parameters, notably on volatile acidity and aroma complexity. Production kinetics and final content of several volatile compounds are also differentially influenced by standard or excess ammonium supplementation.

27754404|t|Paradoxical Effects of Fruit on Obesity.
27754404|a|Obesity is exponentially increasing regardless of its preventable characteristics. The current measures for preventing obesity have failed to address the severity and prevalence of obesity, so alternative approaches based on nutritional and diet changes are attracting attention for the treatment of obesity. Fruit contains large amounts of simple sugars (glucose, fructose, sucrose, etc.), which are well known to induce obesity. Thus, considering the amount of simple sugars found in fruit, it is reasonable to expect that their consumption should contribute to obesity rather than weight reduction. However, epidemiological research has consistently shown that most types of fruit have anti-obesity effects. Thus, due to their anti-obesity effects as well as their vitamin and mineral contents, health organizations are suggesting the consumption of fruit for weight reduction purposes. These contradictory characteristics of fruit with respect to human body weight management motivated us to study previous research to understand the contribution of different types of fruit to weight management. In this review article, we analyze and discuss the relationships between fruit and their anti-obesity effects based on numerous possible underlying mechanisms, and we conclude that each type of fruit has different effects on body weight.

19201840|t|Carbon monoxide inhibits TLR-induced dendritic cell immunogenicity.
19201840|a|Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) exerts its functions via the catabolism of heme into carbon monoxide (CO), Fe(2+), and biliverdin, as well as by depletion of free heme. We have recently described that overexpression of HO-1 is associated with the tolerogenic capacity to dendritic cells (DCs) stimulated by LPS. In this study, we demonstrate that treatment of human monocyte-derived DCs with CO blocks TLR3 and 4-induced phenotypic maturation, secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, and alloreactive T cell proliferation, while preserving IL-10 production. Treatment of DCs with biliverdin, bilirubin, and deferoxamine or replenishing intracellular heme stores had no effect on DC maturation. HO-1 and CO inhibited LPS-induced activation of the IFN regulatory factor 3 pathway and their effects were independent of p38, ERK, and JNK MAPK. HO-1 and CO treatment also inhibited mouse DC maturation in vitro and mouse DC immunogenic properties in vivo, as shown by adoptive cell transfer in a transgenic model of induced diabetes. Thus, for the first time, our data show that CO treatment inhibits DC immunogenicity induced by TLR ligands and that blockade of IFN regulatory factor 3 is associated with this effect.

12950545|t|Computational model of the ventricular action potential in adult spontaneously hypertensive rats.
12950545|a|INTRODUCTION: Cardiac hypertrophy has substantial clinical significance because many hypertrophic cells have markedly prolonged repolarization behavior, which may lead to increased risk for cardiac arrhythmias. Spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) is one model of hypertension that is studied extensively and is considered to be the best laboratory model of human hypertension. We extended our previously published model of the rat ventricular myocyte to simulate the effects of hypertrophy in SHR. METHODS AND RESULTS: In SHR it has been shown that the membrane capacitance is increased, the density of transient outward K+ current is decreased, the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase activity is reduced, and the cell volumes are increased compared to those of the normal rat. We introduced these changes into our previous model of the rat ventricular myocyte and simulated the ventricular action potential of SHR. Our results demonstrated increased action potential duration (APD) and increased peak systolic value of the intracellular calcium transient in SHR. Simulations with reduced extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]o) have shown that there is increased APD shortening in SHR compared to that of the normal rat. CONCLUSIONS: Our computational model qualitatively simulated the electrophysiologic changes observed in SHR and provided the plausible mechanistic linkage between the prolonged APD and increased inotropy. Our model results also demonstrated the electrophysiologic changes observed with reduced [K+]o in SHR, a finding that is clinically significant in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy undergoing diuretic treatment.

18959466|t|Generation of oxygen deficiency in cell culture using a two-enzyme system to evaluate agents targeting hypoxic tumor cells.
18959466|a|The poor and aberrant vascularization of solid tumors makes them susceptible to localized areas of oxygen deficiency that can be considered sites of tumor vulnerability to prodrugs that are preferentially activated to cytotoxic species under conditions of low oxygenation. To readily facilitate the selection of agents targeted to oxygen-deficient cells in solid tumors, we have developed a simple and convenient two-enzyme system to generate oxygen deficiency in cell cultures. Glucose oxidase is employed to deplete oxygen from the medium by selectively oxidizing glucose and reducing molecular oxygen to hydrogen peroxide; an excess of catalase is also used to scavenge the peroxide molecules. Rapid and sustained depletion of oxygen occurs in medium or buffer, even in the presence of oxygen at the liquid/air interface. Studies using CHO/AA8 Chinese hamster cells, EMT6 murine mammary carcinoma cells, and U251 human glioma cells indicate that this system generates an oxygen deficiency that produces activation of the hypoxia-targeted prodrug KS119. This method of generating oxygen deficiency in cell culture is inexpensive, does not require cumbersome equipment, permits longer incubation times to be used without the loss of sample volume, and should be adaptable for high-throughput screening in 96-well plates.

26022185|t|Intracellular calcium attenuates late current conducted by mutant human cardiac sodium channels.
26022185|a|BACKGROUND: Mutations of the cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel (SCN5A gene encoding voltage-gated sodium channel [NaV1.5]) cause congenital long-QT syndrome type 3 (LQT3). Most NaV1.5 mutations associated with LQT3 promote a mode of sodium channel gating in which some channels fail to inactivate, contributing to increased late sodium current (INaL), which is directly responsible for delayed repolarization and prolongation of the QT interval. LQT3 patients have highest risk of arrhythmia during sleep or during periods of slow heart rate. During exercise (high heart rate), there is elevated steady-state intracellular free calcium (Ca(2+)) concentration. We hypothesized that higher levels of intracellular Ca(2+) may lower arrhythmia risk in LQT3 subjects through effects on INaL. METHODS AND RESULTS: We tested this idea by examining the effects of varying intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations on the level of INaL in cells expressing a typical LQT3 mutation, delKPQ, and another SCN5A mutation, R225P. We found that elevated intracellular Ca(2+) concentration significantly reduced INaL conducted by mutant channels but not wild-type channels. This attenuation of INaL in delKPQ expressing cells by Ca(2+) was not affected by the CaM kinase II inhibitor KN-93 but was partially attenuated by truncating the C-terminus of the channel. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that intracellular Ca(2+) contributes to the regulation of INaL conducted by NaV1.5 mutants and propose that, during excitation-contraction coupling, elevated intracellular Ca(2+) suppresses mutant channel INaL and protects cells from delayed repolarization. These findings offer a plausible explanation for the lower arrhythmia risk in LQT3 subjects during fast heart rates.

6782048|t|Transfer of oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide through normal adult human skin.
6782048|a|The resistance to the flow of oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide through the skin ws measured in three normal adult human subjects. A sampling chamber 2.5 cm in diameter, heated to 43-44 degrees C, was applied to the skin of the forearm and gas sampled with a mass spectrometer at a rate of about 10(-5) ml . s-1 through membranes of different resistance. Skin resistance was calculated from the results of sequential studies with different membranes of known resistance on the sampling chamber. The resistance to oxygen flow (1.79 +/- 0.92 X 10(3) atm . ml-1 . min . cm2) was 1/5 of that for nitrogen and 28.5 times that for carbon dioxide. The response time of the skin to a sudden change in arterial gas tension was investigated by having the subjects rebreathe 5% carbon dioxide in oxygen and then breathe air. The mean transit times though the skin for oxygen and carbon dioxide were similar (approx 30 s) and about twice those for nitrogen. The finding of similar response times for oxygen and carbon dioxide transfer in the face of large differences in resistance suggests that there is a high capacitance for carbon dioxide in the skin, presumably due to its high solubility and the effects of buffering.

1389956|t|Therapeutic modulation of brain temperature: relevance to ischemic brain injury.
1389956|a|Hypothermia was first applied therapeutically as a local anesthetic and later was used to achieve organ protection during procedures necessitating circulatory interruption. Profound whole-body hypothermia, typically carried out in conjunction with extracorporeal bypass, has long been employed during cardiac and neurosurgical operative procedures. More recently, studies in small-animal experimental models of cerebral ischemia have provided persuasive evidence that even small decreases in brain temperature confer striking protection against ischemic neuronal injury. By contrast, small elevations of brain temperature during ischemia accelerate and extend pathologic changes in the brain and promote early disruption of the blood-brain barrier. Hypothermia retards the rate of high-energy phosphate depletion during ischemia and promotes postischemic metabolic recovery. More importantly, mild intraischemic hypothermia markedly attenuates the release of glutamate into the brain's extracellular space and significantly diminishes the release of dopamine. Similarly, the inhibition of calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II triggered by normothermic ischemia is prevented by hypothermia, as is the ischemia-induced translocation and inhibition of the key regulatory enzyme protein kinase C. Hypothermia also appears to facilitate the resynthesis of ubiquitin following ischemia. Studies of potential clinical importance have shown that moderate hypothermia is capable of attenuating ischemic damage even if instituted early in the postischemic period. In the setting of focal cerebral ischemia, moderate brain hypothermia reduces the infarct size (particularly in the setting of reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion); conversely, hyperthermia markedly increases the infarct volume. These studies underscore the importance of monitoring and regulating the brain temperature during experimental studies of cerebral ischemia to insure a consistent pathologic outcome and to avoid the false attribution of "pharmacoprotection" to drugs that reduce the body temperature. The measurement of brain temperature is now practicable in neurosurgical patients requiring invasive monitoring, and human studies have shown that cortical and cerebroventricular temperatures may exceed systemic temperatures. Mild to moderate decreases in brain temperature are neuroprotective in cerebral ischemia, while mild elevations of brain temperature are markedly deleterious in the setting of ischemia or injury. It is anticipated that controlled clinical trials of therapeutic brain temperature modulation will be undertaken over the next several years.

11345799|a|Leydig cell tumors are the primary nongerm cell tumors of the testis, comprising approximately 1 to 3% of all testicular neoplasms. These tumors are bilateral in 5 to 10% of cases. Hypoechoic testicular nodule associated to a child virilising syndrome or adult gynecomastia with negative testis tumor markers (AFP, B-HCG) show a high index suspicion for this entity. We report a case of metachronous contralateral Leydig cell tumor in a 32 years old man with a 9 year interval between presentations, in which we performed local excision of the lesion. Diagnostic an therapeutic aspects are reviewed in literature. Since preoperative diagnosis of Leydig cell tumors in difficult and clinical course unpredictible, radical orchiectomy has been the standard treatment. Emphasis is made on conservative management opportunity in patients with only one testis, small tumors (less than 2.5 cm) with biopsies from tumor bed negative and wishes to remain fertile and/or refuses androgen supplementation. Follow-up is mandatory by performing scrotal ultrasounds. CT scan, Chest X-Ray, tumor markers and hormone determinations (testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, LH and FSH).

11009068|t|hKCNN3 which maps to chromosome 1q21 is not the causative gene in periodic catatonia, a familial subtype of schizophrenia.
11009068|a|The human calcium-activated potassium channel gene (hKCNN3, hSKCa3) contains two tandemly arranged, multiallelic CAG repeats located in exon 1 which result in short to moderate polyglutamine stretches of unknown functional significance. Case-control and family-based association studies suggested an association of hKCNN3 repeats with susceptibility for schizophrenia. Twelve multiplex pedigrees with periodic catatonia, a schizophrenia subtype with major gene effect and patterns of anticipation, were genotyped using the multiallelic hKCNN3 repeat polymorphism. Using a dominant model of inheritance with sex- and age-dependent penetrance classes, cumulative results showed exclusion of linkage of hKCNN3 to periodic catatonia under the assumption of genetic homogeneity with lod score of -48.01 at zero recombination fraction. Our results provide evidence that hKCNN3 is not the causative gene in the familial schizophrenia subtype of periodic catatonia. By fluorescent in situ hybridization we confirmed the assignment of hKCNN3 to chromosome 1q21 near the heterochromatin region. Linkage mapping showed segregation with marker D1S498 (theta = 0.05) and placed hKCNN3 in the genetic linkage map in a cluster of genes near the centromeric region of chromosome 1.

6261099|t|[Ultrastructure of Candida utilis during pulsed carbon feeding and in the presence of different initial concentrations of nitrogen].
6261099|a|The yeast Candida utilis IBPM-Y-405 was cultivated in a chemically defined medium in the conditions of pulse addition of a carbon source. The ultrastructure of the yeast cells was studied at different initial concentrations of a nitrogen source (0.152, 0.088 and 0.044 g of NH4+ per litre of the medium). Morphologically different mitochondria (dense and transparent) were found in one and the same cell at an initial concentration of NH4+ equal to 0.088 g per litre of the medium. When this concentration was equal to 0.044 g per litre of the medium, the number of transparent mitochondria increased, the mitochondria shrank, giant vacuoles comprising regions of the cytoplasm appeared in the cells, as well as large lipid inclusions, the cytoplasm became less thick and contained crystal-like inclusions. All of the aforementioned ultrastructural changes are quite reversible if the initial concentration of the nitrogen source is increased.

21940137|t|Expression pattern, ethanol-metabolizing activities, and cellular localization of alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases in human large bowel: association of the functional polymorphisms of ADH and ALDH genes with hemorrhoids and colorectal cancer.
21940137|a|Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) are principal enzymes responsible for metabolism of ethanol. Functional polymorphisms of ADH1B, ADH1C, and ALDH2 genes occur among racial populations. The goal of this study was to systematically determine the functional expressions and cellular localization of ADHs and ALDHs in human rectal mucosa, the lesions of adenocarcinoma and hemorrhoid, and the genetic association of allelic variations of ADH and ALDH with large bowel disorders. Twenty-one surgical specimens of rectal adenocarcinoma and the adjacent normal mucosa, including 16 paired tissues of rectal tumor, normal mucosae of rectum and sigmoid colon from the same individuals, and 18 surgical mixed hemorrhoid specimens and leukocyte DNA samples from 103 colorectal cancer patients, 67 hemorrhoid patients, and 545 control subjects recruited in previous study, were investigated. The isozyme/allozyme expression patterns of ADH and ALDH were identified by isoelectric focusing and the activities were assayed spectrophotometrically. The protein contents of ADH/ALDH isozymes were determined by immunoblotting using the corresponding purified class-specific antibodies; the cellular activity and protein localizations were detected by immunohistochemistry and histochemistry, respectively. Genotypes of ADH1B, ADH1C, and ALDH2 were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms. At 33mM ethanol, pH 7.5, the activity of ADH1C*1/1 phenotypes exhibited 87% higher than that of the ADH1C*1/*2 phenotypes in normal rectal mucosa. The activity of ALDH2-active phenotypes of rectal mucosa was 33% greater than ALDH2-inactive phenotypes at 200μM acetaldehyde. The protein contents in normal rectal mucosa were in the following order: ADH1>ALDH2>ADH3≈ALDH1A1, whereas those of ADH2, ADH4, and ALDH3A1 were fairly low. Both activity and content of ADH1 were significantly decreased in rectal tumors, whereas the ALDH activity remained unchanged. The ADH activity was also significantly reduced in hemorrhoids. ADH4 and ALDH3A1 were uniquely expressed in the squamous epithelium of anus at anorectal junctions. The allele frequencies of ADH1C*1 and ALDH2*2 were significantly higher in colorectal cancer and that of ALDH2*2 also significantly greater in hemorrhoids. In conclusion, ADH and ALDH isozymes are differentially expressed in mucosal cells of rectum and anus. The results suggest that acetaldehyde, an immediate metabolite of ethanol, may play an etiological role in pathogenesis of large bowel diseases.

3875570|t|Differential antiproliferative actions of 2',5' oligo A trimer core and its cordycepin analogue on human tumor cells.
3875570|a|The antiproliferative effect of 2',5' A3 core and 2',5'-3'dA3 (cordycepin trimer) core was measured in 8 human tumor cell lines. Cells were treated in a dose-response manner for 72 hr and the concentration of drug necessary to inhibit cell growth 50% (GI50) was determined. A wide range of sensitivities to these drugs was found, even among tumors of the same histological type. The cell lines showed different sensitivities and dose-response curves to the 2',5'A3 and 2',5'-3'dA3 cores. Uptake studies of the 2',5'A3 and 2',5'-3'dA3 cores, using high-pressure liquid chromatography, demonstrated that both cores were rapidly degraded in the tissue culture medium and taken up as adenosine or cordycepin, respectively. There was a direct correlation between the uptake of cordycepin and the antiproliferative effect. In contrast, there was no correlation between cell sensitivity and the uptake of the 2',5'A3 core degradation products. Analysis of intracellular nucleosides and nucleotides indicated that differences in intracellular metabolism of adenosine might explain the different sensitivities of the various cell lines to 2',5'A3 core. Molar equivalent concentrations of adenosine and cordycepin inhibited cell growth; however, equimolar concentrations of these nucleosides were not effective. In addition, the antiproliferative effect of both core compounds and their corresponding nucleosides could be potentiated by the addition of the adenosine deaminase inhibitor, deoxycoformycin. The results indicate that these cores act as prodrugs and that the active metabolites are their corresponding nucleosides.

7528123|t|Effect of fixation on quantification of the expression of leucocyte function-associated surface antigens.
7528123|a|The surface expression of adhesion molecules and other function-associated antigens on peripheral blood leucocytes may be measured by flow cytometry. However, quantification of these antigens is difficult, because their expression can be rapidly and artefactually modulated if the cells are activated in vitro. Consequently, it is common, when analyzing these antigens either: (1) to label leucocytes in whole blood at 4 degrees C, to lyse erythrocytes and then fix the leucocytes, or (2) to fix the leucocytes in whole blood, to lyse the erythrocytes, and then label the leucocytes. We have compared the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values for CD11b, CD18, and L-selectin (Leu-8 and TQ1 epitopes) on human peripheral blood leucocytes, using these two approaches. In addition, we have simultaneously evaluated how anticoagulants (acid citrate, K3EDTA, and heparin) and the presence or absence of divalent metal ions (Ca2+ and Mg2+) affect the expression levels of these antigens. The results for all four epitopes varied markedly depending on the preparation procedure used but were less affected by the choice of anticoagulant and whether divalent cations were or were not present in the media used for cell preparation and labelling. Comparison of the results obtained using these procedures, which involve fixation with formaldehyde, with those obtained by a recently developed procedure in which unfixed leucocytes were labelled with the vital nuclear dye LDS-751 and antibodies together, then analysed in unlysed whole blood at 4 degrees C, showed that formaldehyde-based preparation techniques underestimated the expression (MFI) of CD18, Leu-8, and TQ1. It is recommended that, whenever practicable, measurements are made on unfixed cells stained using the newer procedure.

11093024|t|Biochemical composition and cariogenicity of dental plaque formed in the presence of sucrose or glucose and fructose.
11093024|a|The composition of dental plaque formed in the presence of sucrose or glucose and fructose and its relation to cariogenicity was evaluated. Twelve adult volunteers took part in this crossover study done in three phases of 28 days each. For each phase, an acrylic resin appliance containing four human dental enamel blocks was constructed for the volunteers. Solutions containing 20% sucrose or 10% glucose + 10% fructose were dripped onto the enamel blocks 8 times a day, while in the control group no solution was used. Enamel surface and cross-sectional microhardness results showed that dental plaque formed in the presence of sucrose was more cariogenic than that formed in the presence of glucose + fructose (p<0.05). The concentration of alkali-soluble carbohydrates in dental plaque was higher in the sucrose group than in the control and glucose + fructose groups (p<0.05). Although concentrations of Ca, P and F were lower in plaque formed in the presence of sucrose than glucose + fructose and the control, significant differences (p<0.05) were only observed in relation to control. The electrophoretic profile of the matrix proteins of dental plaque showed distinct patterns when it was formed in the absence or presence of the different carbohydrates. Although the results suggest that the high cariogenicity of dental plaque formed in the presence of sucrose can be mainly explained by the high concentration of insoluble glucans of its matrix, the low inorganic concentration and its protein composition may have some contribution.

25762630|t|H89 enhances the sensitivity of cancer cells to glyceryl trinitrate through a purinergic receptor-dependent pathway.
25762630|a|High doses of the organic nitrate glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), a nitric oxide (NO) donor, are known to trigger apoptosis in human cancer cells. Here, we show that such a cytotoxic effect can be obtained with subtoxic concentrations of GTN when combined with H89, N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulphonamide.2HCl. This synergistic effect requires the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from H89 and NO from GTN treatment that causes cGMP production and PKG activation. Furthermore, the GTN/H89 synergy was attenuated by inhibition of P2-purinergic receptors with suramin and competition with ATP/UDP. By down-regulating genes with antisense oligonucleotides, P2-purinergic receptors P2X3, P2Y1, and P2Y6 were found to have a role in creating this cytotoxic effect. Thus, H89 likely acts as an ATP mimetic synergizing with GTN to trigger apoptosis in aggressive cancer cells.

18264981|t|Energy metabolism transition in multi-cellular human tumor spheroids.
18264981|a|It is thought that glycolysis is the predominant energy pathway in cancer, particularly in solid and poorly vascularized tumors where hypoxic regions develop. To evaluate whether glycolysis does effectively predominate for ATP supply and to identify the underlying biochemical mechanisms, the glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) fluxes, ATP/ADP ratio, phosphorylation potential, and expression and activity of relevant energy metabolism enzymes were determined in multi-cellular tumor spheroids, as a model of human solid tumors. In HeLa and Hek293 young-spheroids, the OxPhos flux and cytochrome c oxidase protein content and activity were similar to those observed in monolayer cultured cells, whereas the glycolytic flux increased two- to fourfold; the contribution of OxPhos to ATP supply was 60%. In contrast, in old-spheroids, OxPhos, ATP content, ATP/ADP ratio, and phosphorylation potential diminished 50-70%, as well as the activity (88%) and content (3 times) of cytochrome c oxidase. Glycolysis and hexokinase increased significantly (both, 4 times); consequently glycolysis was the predominant pathway for ATP supply (80%). These changes were associated with an increase (3.3 times) in the HIF-1alpha content. After chronic exposure, both oxidative and glycolytic inhibitors blocked spheroid growth, although the glycolytic inhibitors, 2-deoxyglucose and gossypol (IC(50) of 15-17 nM), were more potent than the mitochondrial inhibitors, casiopeina II-gly, laherradurin, and rhodamine 123 (IC(50) > 100 nM). These results suggest that glycolysis and OxPhos might be considered as metabolic targets to diminish cellular proliferation in poorly vascularized, hypoxic solid tumors.

28059145|t|A Markov State-based Quantitative Kinetic Model of Sodium Release from the Dopamine Transporter.
28059145|a|The dopamine transporter (DAT) belongs to the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter (NSS) family of membrane proteins that are responsible for reuptake of neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft to terminate a neuronal signal and enable subsequent neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic neuron. The release of one sodium ion from the crystallographically determined sodium binding site Na2 had been identified as an initial step in the transport cycle which prepares the transporter for substrate translocation by stabilizing an inward-open conformation. We have constructed Markov State Models (MSMs) from extensive molecular dynamics simulations of human DAT (hDAT) to explore the mechanism of this sodium release. Our results quantify the release process triggered by hydration of the Na2 site that occurs concomitantly with a conformational transition from an outward-facing to an inward-facing state of the transporter. The kinetics of the release process are computed from the MSM, and transition path theory is used to identify the most probable sodium release pathways. An intermediate state is discovered on the sodium release pathway, and the results reveal the importance of various modes of interaction of the N-terminus of hDAT in controlling the pathways of release.

12888280|t|Human ZIP1 is a major zinc uptake transporter for the accumulation of zinc in prostate cells.
12888280|a|The prostate gland of humans and other animals accumulates a level of zinc that is 3-10 times greater than that found in other tissues. Associated with this ability to accumulate zinc is a rapid zinc uptake process in human prostate cells, which we previously identified as the hZIP1 zinc transporter. We now provide additional evidence that hZIP1 is an important operational transporter that allows for the transport and accumulation of zinc. The studies reveal that hZIP1 (SLC39A1) but not hZIP2 (SLC39A2) is expressed in the zinc-accumulating human prostate cell lines, LNCaP and PC-3. Transfected PC-3 cells that overexpress hZIP1 exhibit increased uptake and accumulation of zinc. The V(max) for zinc uptake was increased with no change in K(m). Along with the increased intracellular accumulation of zinc, the overexpression of hZIP1 also results in the inhibition of growth of PC-3 cells. Down-regulation of hZIP1 by treatment of PC-3 cells with hZIP1 antisense oligonucleotide resulted in a decreased zinc uptake. Uptake of zinc from zinc chelated with citrate was as rapid as from free zinc ions; however, the cells did not take up zinc chelated with EDTA. The cellular uptake of zinc is not dependent upon an available pool of free Zn(2+) ions. Instead, the mechanism of transport appears to involve the transport of zinc from low molecular weight ligands that exist in circulation as relatively loosely bound complexes with zinc.

3760584|t|Measurement of NADPH oxidase activity in detergent lysates of human and mouse macrophage monolayers.
3760584|a|An assay to measure NADPH oxidase activity in detergent lysates of macrophage monolayers is described. The addition of a reaction mixture containing appropriate concentrations of disrupting detergents, NADPH as oxidase substrate and cytochrome c as electron acceptor, to macrophages monolayers permits the reliable detection of a superoxide dismutase-sensitive NADPH-dependent cytochrome c reductive activity. This activity is strictly substrate dependent and NADH could not substitute for NADPH. The NADPH-dependent superoxide anion-forming activity (NADPH oxidase) was investigated in different populations of human and mouse macrophages. NADPH oxidase was activated by stimulation of macrophages with phorbol-myristate acetate and activity levels correlated with ability of intact cells to produce superoxide anion. The optimal conditions for assay of NADPH oxidase were investigated and the assay was used to measure the kinetic properties of the NADPH oxidase. The assay permits investigations of the enzymatic basis of oxidative metabolism in macrophages cultivated as adherent cells without any requirements for recovery of the cells in suspension and subcellular fractionation.

8244702|t|A method to obtain subject background for low-level in-vivo measurements of the head.
8244702|a|Background for an in-vivo whole-body counter measurement is commonly obtained by averaging the counts of one or more matched (size, weight, gender) control subjects who have not been exposed to the radionuclide of interest. This limits the statistical significance to the time of the count, generally 30 min to 1 h when counting people. To obtain a human background with a small associated counting error in this manner would require counting the matching control subjects for a period much longer than they could tolerate. Also, it may not be possible to find a matching control subject who has not been exposed to the radionuclide of interest, as in the case of 210Pb, a nuclide that is normally present in air, food, and water, and to which everyone has been exposed all of their lives. This paper presents a method developed at New York University Medical Center, Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine to obtain a matching background for any subject, for use in the measurement of 210Pb in the skull, in-vivo. It is obtained using a head phantom containing known amounts of potassium and calcium. The phantom, surrounded by three phoswich detectors in the same position as the subject's head, is counted repeatedly for long periods. Although it has been used to obtain "head" backgrounds only in the 210Pb spectral region, the method should be applicable to other regions of the low-energy phoswich spectrum.

8671266|t|Human seminal plasma inhibits brain nitric oxide synthase activity.
8671266|a|Nitric oxide is a chemical messenger which functions as a neurotransmitter or as a cytotoxic agent. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) has been isolated from various mammalian reproductive tissues. The presence or absence of NOS in spermatozoa has not yet been reported. We therefore tested human and murine spermatozoa for NOS activity by measuring the conversion of arginine to citrulline. No activity was found either in human or in murine spermatozoa. Human native semen and human seminal plasma exerted an inhibition on brain NOS activity, as assayed on rat brain cytosolic fractions. This inhibitory effect was dependent on the amount of protein present in the human seminal plasma. No inhibitory effect was observed when homogenates of washed spermatozoa were tested. The human seminal plasma did not affect the Michaelis constant (Km) of NOS for L-arginine (endogenous NOS substrate) whereas the maximal velocity (Vmax) was reduced, suggesting that it contains a non-competitive inhibitor of brain NOS. This inhibitory component was virtually insensitive to heat; a 10 min treatment to 95 degrees C only slightly reduced its ability to inhibit brain NOS. The physiological relevance of our observations remains to be elucidated. Human seminal plasma may exert an inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis on cells other than spermatozoa or on cells from the male or female genital tract, modulating directly or indirectly (via modulation of reactive oxygen species formation) the functional state of the spermatozoa.

8602852|t|Attenuation of p47phox and p67phox membrane translocation as the inhibitory mechanism of S-nitrosothiol on the respiratory burst oxidase in human neutrophils.
8602852|a|The effect of the S-nitrosothiol (RSNO) on the activation of NADPH oxidase in human neutrophils was studied using an in vitro translocation system in which an anionic amphiphil, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate or arachidonate, plays a role as an activator. When membranes pretreated with RSNO and a cytosol fraction from resting neutrophils were combined to reconstitute the NADPH oxidase, both translocation of the cytosolic NADPH oxidase components such as p47phox and p67phox to the plasma membrane fraction and subsequent superoxide generation was inhibited. However, RSNO had no effect on O2- production when added after enzyme activation. A similar inhibition of translocation of recombinant p47phox was observed with RSNO-treated membrane. When the RSNO-treated membrane fraction was exposed to 2-mercaptoethanol the inhibition was reversed. The data suggest that RSNO inhibits translocation of p47phox or p47phox containing cytosolic complex via a direct effect on the membrane component of the NADPH oxidase.

27687310|t|Vectorized Gene Therapy of Liver Tumors: Proof of Concept of TG4023 (MVA-FCU1) in Combination with Flucytosine.
27687310|a|BACKGROUND: TG4023 is a modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) containing the yeast-originated transgene FCU1, expressing cytosine deaminase and uracil phosphoribosyltransferase enzymes that transform the prodrug flucytosine (5-FC) into cytotoxic 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and 5-fluorouridine-5'-monophosphate (5-FUMP), respectively. This first-in-human study aimed to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intra-tumoral (IT) TG4023 and the safety, feasibility, and proof-of-concept (PoC) of TG4023/5-FC combination to deliver high 5-FU concentrations in tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS:  plaque forming units (pfu) using ultrasound imaging guidance, after a dose-limiting toxicities (DLT)-driven 3+3 dose-escalating design. On Day 2, patients were given intravenous and/or oral 5-FC at a dose of 200 mg/kg/day for 14 days and were followed for safety through Day 43. Tumor response was assessed at Week 6, according to RECIST. Plasma and tumor 5-FU concentrations were measured to establish the PoC. RESULTS:  pfu; MTD was therefore not reached. The most frequent adverse events were pyrexia, asthenia, vomiting, and decreased appetite. 8/16 patients had stable disease. Mean 5-FU concentrations in plasma were 1.9±2.6 ng/mL and 56±30 ng/g in tumors. Seroconversion for anti-FCU1 antibodies was found for 1 patient from each cohort (16%, overall). CONCLUSIONS:  pfu. Therapeutic 5-FU concentrations in tumors established the virus-directed enzyme-prodrug therapy (VDEPT) PoC.ClinicalTrials.gov Number: NCT00978107.

23318559|t|Perinatal choline effects on neonatal pathophysiology related to later schizophrenia risk.
23318559|a|OBJECTIVE: Deficient cerebral inhibition is a pathophysiological brain deficit related to poor sensory gating and attention in schizophrenia and other disorders. Cerebral inhibition develops perinatally, influenced by genetic and in utero factors. Amniotic choline activates fetal α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and facilitates development of cerebral inhibition. Increasing this activation may protect infants from future illness by promoting normal brain development. The authors investigated the effects of perinatal choline supplementation on the development of cerebral inhibition in human infants. METHOD: A randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of dietary phosphatidylcholine supplementation was conducted with 100 healthy pregnant women, starting in the second trimester. Supplementation to twice normal dietary levels for mother or newborn continued through the third postnatal month. All women received dietary advice regardless of treatment. Infants' electrophysiological recordings of inhibition of the P50 component of the cerebral evoked response to paired sounds were analyzed. The criterion for inhibition was suppression of the amplitude of the second P50 response by at least half, compared with the first response. RESULTS: No adverse effects of choline were observed in maternal health and delivery, birth, or infant development. At the fifth postnatal week, the P50 response was suppressed in more choline-treated infants (76%) compared with placebo-treated infants (43%) (effect size=0.7). There was no difference at the 13th week. A CHRNA7 genotype associated with schizophrenia was correlated with diminished P50 inhibition in the placebo-treated infants, but not in the choline-treated infants. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal developmental delay in inhibition is associated with attentional problems as the child matures. Perinatal choline activates timely development of cerebral inhibition, even in the presence of gene mutations that otherwise delay it.

2667348|t|Practical considerations of recombinant human erythropoietin therapy.
2667348|a|The effect of long-term hemodialysis in 58 nonanemic end-stage renal disease patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO; EPOGEN [epoetin alfa], AMGEN Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA) has been examined in detail. Increased dialyzer prescription (Kt/V) was correlated with the need for a lower maintenance dose of r-HuEPO. After 1 year of therapy, stable increases in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and reticulocyte levels were obtained without other clinically significant hematologic changes. In a randomly selected subgroup of 14 patients, 5 developed predialysis increased diastolic pressures. In this group, an early increase in cardiac output and ejection fraction was accompanied by a decrease in total peripheral resistance index (TPRI). Later changes showed a steady increase in TPRI with an associated mild increase in mean arterial pressure. A slight increase in cardiac responsiveness to fistula occlusive maneuvers was also found. Hospital admissions and mortality rates were not significantly different from those of a cohort control population. At a fixed Kt/V there were slight decreases in solute clearances with correction of anemia, with phosphate, urate, and creatinine changing significantly. Corrective measures required simple compensatory adjustments in dialysis blood-flow rates. Intradialytic complications were noticeably improved. Patients receiving long-term r-HuEPO replacement therapy do remarkably well without major complications.

10890895|t|Retinoic acid induces sodium/iodide symporter gene expression and radioiodide uptake in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line.
10890895|a|The sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) stimulates iodide uptake in normal lactating breast, but is not known to be active in nonlactating breast or breast cancer. We studied NIS gene regulation and iodide uptake in MCF-7 cells, an estrogen receptor (ER)-positive human breast cancer cell line. All-trans retinoic acid (tRA) treatment stimulated iodide uptake in a time- and dose-dependent fashion up to approximately 9.4-fold above baseline. Stimulation with selective retinoid compounds indicated that the induction of iodide uptake was mediated by retinoic acid receptor. Treatment with tRA markedly stimulated NIS mRNA and immunoreactive protein ( approximately 68 kDa). tRA stimulated NIS gene transcription approximately 4-fold, as shown by nuclear run-on assay. No induction of iodide uptake was observed with RA treatment of an ER-negative human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB 231, or a normal human breast cell line, MCF-12A. The iodide efflux rate of tRA-treated MCF-7 cells was slow (t(1/2) = 24 min), compared with that in FRTL-5 thyroid cells (t(1/2) = 3.9 min), favoring iodide retention in MCF-7 cells. An in vitro clonogenic assay demonstrated selective cytotoxicity with (131)I after tRA stimulation of MCF-7 cells. tRA up-regulates NIS gene expression and iodide uptake in an ER-positive breast cancer cell line. Stimulation of radioiodide uptake after systemic retinoid treatment may be useful for diagnosis and treatment of some differentiated breast cancers.

17044776|t|Reactive oxygen species production is involved in quercetin-induced apoptosis in human hepatoma cells.
17044776|a|Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the leading cause of cancer mortality in Asia. The aim of this study was to examine whether reactive oxygen species production is involved in quercetin-induced apoptosis in human HCC cell lines. Quercetin inhibited the growth of hepatoma cells in dose and time dependent manners. Quercetin treatment of hepatoma cells resulted in changes of cell cycle progression. The G0/G1phase was decreased and S phase was increased in HA22T/VGH cells after treatment with quercetin. The levels of apoptotic sub-G0/G1, reactive oxygen species and annexin V were increased prior to cell death and concurrent with lipid peroxidation in two human hepatoma cells after treatment with quercetin. Quercetin also enhanced the apoptotic effect of the chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel, in HA22T/VGH cells. Quercetin has therapeutic potential as an anti-cancer drug. These results provide basis for further study into the potential use of quercetin in combination with paclitaxel for treatment of hepatoma.

1525871|t|The UAS(MAL) is a bidirectional promotor element required for the expression of both the MAL61 and MAL62 genes of the Saccharomyces MAL6 locus.
1525871|a|Maltose fermentation in Saccharomyces yeasts requires one of five unlinked MAL loci: MAL1, 2, 3, 4, or 6. Each locus consists of three genes encoding maltose permease, maltase and the MAL activator. At MAL6 the genes are called MAL61, MAL62 and MAL63, respectively. Transcription of MAL61 and MAL62 is coordinately induced by maltose and repressed by glucose and this regulation is mediated by the MAL activator. By deletion analysis of the MAL61-MAL62 intergenic region, we show that a 68-basepair region, from base pairs -515 to -582 upstream of the MAL61 start codon, contains a sequence necessary for the maltose-induced expression of MAL61 and MAL62, the UAS(MAL). This sequence contains two copies of an 11-basepair dyad which may be the active elements of the UAS(MAL). Using heterologous gene plasmid constructs, we demonstrate that the UAS(MAL) sequence is sufficient for maltose inducibility of MAL62 and that this regulated expression requires a functional MAL activator. Our results suggest that the MAL61-MAL62 intergenic region contains additional distinct elements which function to precisely regulate MAL61 and/or MAL62 expression. Among these are repressing sequences, including a glucose-responsive element located between base pairs -583 and -638, which is partially responsible for mediating glucose-repression of MAL62 expression.

7542958|t|Calcium transport in human term placental mitochondria.
7542958|a|The kinetic characteristics of the transport of Ca2+ in the human term placental mitochondria previously depleted of their intramitochondrial calcium, was studied. Maximal Ca2+ uptake was observed in the presence of inorganic phosphate and ADP. Ca2+ transport showed a Michaelis-Menten behavior, with a Vmax of 61 nmol mg-1 min-1 and a Km of 118 microM. Ruthenium red inhibited mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Under optimal conditions of Ca2+ uptake, the cation inhibited progesterone synthesis in placental mitochondria. The kinetic parameters of Ca2+ transport agree with the physiological role of mitochondria in the human placenta.

9826107|t|Nitrite and nitrate levels in cerebrospinal fluid of normal subjects.
9826107|a|In order to evaluate the involvement of nitric oxide in neurologic disorders it is important to generate controlled values of its metabolites nitrite and nitrate in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Samples of CSF obtained from 14 patients without neurologic diseases were analysed for nitrite and nitrate concentration by reverse phase chromatography with ultraviolet (UV) detection. For comparison, the levels of nitrite in the same samples were also measured by reverse phase chromatography coupled with electrochemical detection and those of nitrate by ion chromatography coupled with UV detection. A good correlation was found for the concentration values of both ions obtained with the two procedures. Then, 10.41 +/- 0.47 ng/ml of nitrite and 2.92 +/- 0.37 ng/ml of nitrate could be regarded as reliable values in control subjects. No correlation between age and levels of nitrite and nitrate was observed.

9207771|t|Effect of amine and stannous fluoride on human neutrophil functions in vitro.
9207771|a|Amine fluoride (AmF)- and stannous fluoride (SnF2)-containing products were found to have a therapeutic effect on gingivitis and periodontitis. This effect was suggested to correlate with the antibacterial activity of the fluoride compounds. However, their effect on inflammatory cell function can also play a role in the therapeutic effect on gingival inflammation. The present study was designed to test the effects of AmF, SnF2, and an AmF/SnF2 combination on the function of human peripheral blood neutrophils, as compared with effects of chlorhexidine and salicylic acid. Neutrophils were isolated from human blood by ficoll centrifugation followed by dextran sedimentation. The neutrophils were pre-incubated with AmF, SnF2, or AmF/SnF2, followed by stimulation with fMLP. Cell vitality was verified by trypan-blue exclusion (> 95% vitality at all tested concentrations). Superoxide production was measured by cytochrome C reduction and the enzymatic activity of lysozyme and beta-glucoronidase by optical density measurement of substrate conversion. The results showed that AmF, SnF2, or AmF/SnF2 enhanced by two- to three-fold the superoxide release from fMLP-stimulated human neutrophils. Furthermore, the effective concentration of the AmF/SnF2 combination was several-fold lower than that of AmF or SnF2 alone (10 nM for AmF, 0.5 microM for SnF2, and 3 pM for SnF2/AmF). On the other hand, chlorhexidine and salicylic acid were found to reduce superoxide production by the cells. All the tested compounds had no effect on granular enzyme release by the stimulated neutrophils. The results suggest that AmF and SnF2 enhance the oxygen-dependent antibacterial activity of neutrophils. This effect may contribute to a more efficient elimination of bacteria from the periodontal environment, resulting in improvement in gingival health.

15902992|t|Comparison of erythrocyte and skeletal muscle creatine accumulation following creatine loading.
15902992|a|This study attempted to determine the relationship between creatine (Cr) accumulation in human skeletal muscle and erythrocytes following Cr supplementation. If a strong relationship exists, a blood test might provide a practical, less invasive alternative than muscle biopsy for evaluating cellular Cr accumulation. Eighteen active, but not well-trained males were supplemented with Cr (4 x 5 g/d) for 5 d. Muscle biopsies (vastus lateralis) were obtained pre- and post-loading and analyzed for Cr, phosphocreatine (PCr), and total Cr (TCr) content. Venous blood was also drawn at these times to determine erythrocyte Cr concentrations. Muscle Cr, PCr, and TCr concentrations were elevated (P < 0.05) by 39.8%, 7.5%, and 20.1% respectively following supplementation. Erythrocyte Cr concentrations were also elevated (P < 0.01) following the loading period, although to a greater relative degree than tissue concentrations (129.6%). Pre- and post-loading erythrocyte Cr concentrations were poorly and nonsignificantly correlated with that observed in skeletal muscle. Further, loading-mediated increases in erythrocyte Cr concentrations were poorly correlated with elevations in muscle Cr (r = 0.07), PCr (r = 0.06) or TCr (r = 0.04) concentrations. Erythrocyte Cr concentrations can be augmented by 5 d of Cr supplementation, however, this elevation does not reflect that observed in skeletal muscle obtained by muscle biopsy. Consequently, erythrocyte response to Cr loading is not a reliable measure of skeletal muscle Cr/TCr accumulation.

In two cats with a high carbon dioxide production, CFV failed to maintain carbon dioxide homeostasis since gas flows greater than 1 litre kg-1 min-1 caused thoracic distension and a decrease in arterial pressure. In five patients, endobronchial insufflation of oxygen 0.5 litre kg-1 min-1 caused approximately a 30% decrease in the increase in PaCO2 compared with apnoeic oxygenation (P less than 0.05) during a period of 6 min. CFV at 1 litre kg-1 min-1 can be used for physiological measurement without respiratory movement while maintaining blood-gas homeostasis in dogs and in cats with a normal carbon dioxide production. Ethical constraints have so far prevented the investigation of the effects of comparable gas flows in man.

3110383|t|gamma-Butyrobetaine hydroxylase activity is not rate limiting for carnitine biosynthesis in the human infant.
3110383|a|Carnitine biosynthesis was assessed in human infants by measuring changes in plasma carnitine concentration and rates of urinary carnitine excretion after infants were fed carnitine-free formulas with and without added epsilon-N-trimethyl-L-lysine or gamma-butyrobetaine. This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that carnitine biosynthesis in the human infant is regulated by substrate availability rather than activity of gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase, the final enzyme in the carnitine biosynthetic pathway. Ten infants were fed carnitine-free formula supplemented with either 500 microM epsilon-N-trimethyl-L-lysine or 500 microM gamma-butyrobetaine for 14 d. Plasma carnitine concentration and rate of urinary carnitine excretion were measured in infants before and after this period. Plasma carnitine concentration increased twofold when infants were fed either epsilon-N-trimethyl-L-lysine and increased threefold when infants were fed gamma-butyrobetaine. The rate of carnitine excretion doubled when infants were fed epsilon-N-trimethyl-L-lysine and increased 30-fold when infants were fed gamma-butyrobetaine. Absorption of epsilon-N-trimethyl-L-lysine was verified by demonstrating increased urinary excretion of epsilon-N-trimethyl-L-lysine in infants fed this substrate. We conclude that gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase activity is not rate limiting for carnitine biosynthesis in the human infant. Development of renal and hepatic gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase activity was determined in necropsy tissue from individuals of various ages. It was verified that gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase activity is developmentally regulated in the liver, but not in the kidney. The clinical relevance of this observation is diminished in view of the results of the in vivo studies of carnitine biosynthesis in infants.

20388492|t|Diminished NADPH transhydrogenase activity and mitochondrial redox regulation in human failing myocardium.
20388492|a|Although the functional role of nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (Nnt) remains to be fully elucidated, there is strong evidence that Nnt plays a critical part in mitochondrial metabolism by maintaining a high NADPH-dependent GSH/GSSG ratio, and thus the control of cellular oxidative stress. Using real-time PCR, spectrophotometric and western blotting techniques, we sought to determine the presence, abundance and activity level of Nnt in human heart tissues and to discern whether these are altered in chronic severe heart failure. Left ventricular levels of the NNT gene and protein expression did not differ significantly between the non-failing donor (NF) and heart failure (HF) group. Notably, compared to NF, Nnt activity rates in the HF group were 18% lower, which coincided with significantly higher levels of oxidized glutathione, lower glutathione reductase activity, lower NADPH and a lower GSH/GSSG ratio. In the failing human heart a partial loss of Nnt activity adversely impacts NADPH-dependent enzymes and the capacity to maintain membrane potential, thus contributing to a decline in bioenergetic capacity, redox regulation and antioxidant defense, exacerbating oxidative damage to cellular proteins.

24634113|t|GmPTF1, a novel transcription factor gene, is involved in conferring soybean tolerance to phosphate starvation.
24634113|a|Phosphorus plays a pivotal role in plant growth and development. In this study, we isolated and characterized GmPTF1, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor (TF) gene from soybean (Glycine max) with tolerance to inorganic phosphate (Pi) starvation. Alignment analysis indicated that GmPTF1 and other reported bHLH TFs share significant similarity in the region of the bHLH domain. As with OsPTF1 and other homologous Pi starvation-related bHLH TFs (His-5, Glu-9, Arg-12, and Arg-13), all recognition motifs for the G-box (CACGTG) were present in the GmPTF1 domain. Prokaryotic expression in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) plysS showed that a novel 40-kDa polypeptide was expressed when cells containing GmPTF1 were induced. The subcellular localization in cells from onion epidermis and Arabidopsis roots demonstrated that the GmPTF1 protein was found in the nucleus. Furthermore, analysis of transcription activity in yeast revealed that full-length GmPTF1 and its N-terminal and C-terminal domains could activate the histidine, adenine, and uracil reporter genes. This suggested that the N-terminal and C-terminal peptides of GmPTF1 act as transcriptional activators. When real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed, the expression of GmPTF1 under conditions of phosphate starvation was significantly induced in soybean roots of the low-Pi-tolerant variety ZH15. Moreover, the relative level of expression was much higher there than in roots of the sensitive variety NMH from days 7 to 56 of low-Pi stress. These results imply that GmPTF1 is involved in conferring tolerance to phosphate starvation in soybean.

28890350|t|Thioredoxin-interacting protein promotes high-glucose-induced macrovascular endothelial dysfunction.
28890350|a|Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) emerges as a central regulator for glucose homeostasis, which goes awry in diabetic subjects. Endothelial dysfunction is considered the earliest detectable stage of cardiovascular disease (CVD), a major complication of diabetes. Here, we hypothesize that TXNIP may promote endothelial dysfunction seen in Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D). Using a T1D-like rat model, we found that diabetic rats showed significantly higher TXNIP mRNA and protein levels in peripheral blood, compared to their non-diabetic counterparts. Those changes were accompanied by decreased production of nitric oxide (NO) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), concurrent with increased expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) in the aortic endothelium. In addition, TXNIP overexpression in primary human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) induced by either high glucose or overexpression of carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP), a major transcriptional activator of TXNIP, promoted early apoptosis and impaired NO bioactivity. The correlation between TXNIP expression levels and endothelial dysfunction suggests that TXNIP may be a potential biomarker for vascular complications in T1D patients.

27687866|t|Genetic controls of DNA damage avoidance in response to acetaldehyde in fission yeast.
27687866|a|Acetaldehyde, a primary metabolite of alcohol, forms DNA adducts and disrupts the DNA replication process, causing genomic instability, a hallmark of cancer. Indeed, chronic alcohol consumption accounts for approximately 3.6% of all cancers worldwide. However, how the adducts are prevented and repaired after acetaldehyde exposure is not well understood. In this report, we used the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a model organism to comprehensively understand the genetic controls of DNA damage avoidance in response to acetaldehyde. We demonstrate that Atd1 functions as a major acetaldehyde detoxification enzyme that prevents accumulation of Rad52-DNA repair foci, while Atd2 and Atd3 have minor roles in acetaldehyde detoxification. We found that acetaldehyde causes DNA damage at the replication fork and activates the cell cycle checkpoint to coordinate cell cycle arrest with DNA repair. Our investigation suggests that acetaldehyde-mediated DNA adducts include interstrand-crosslinks and DNA-protein crosslinks. We also demonstrate that acetaldehyde activates multiple DNA repair pathways. Nucleotide excision repair and homologous recombination, which are both epistatically linked to the Fanconi anemia pathway, have major roles in acetaldehyde tolerance, while base excision repair and translesion synthesis also contribute to the prevention of acetaldehyde-dependent genomic instability. We also show the involvement of Wss1-related metalloproteases, Wss1 and Wss2, in acetaldehyde tolerance. These results indicate that acetaldehyde causes cellular stresses that require cells to coordinate multiple cellular processes in order to prevent genomic instability. Considering that acetaldehyde is a human carcinogen, our genetic studies serve as a guiding investigation into the mechanisms of acetaldehyde-dependent genomic instability and carcinogenesis.

16431016|t|Active site variability of type 1 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase revealed by selective inhibitors and cross-species comparisons.
16431016|a|The NADPH-dependent enzyme type 1 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11beta-HSD1) activates in a tissue-specific manner circulating pro-glucocorticoid hormones (cortisone in humans) to the 11beta-OH ligand (cortisol in humans), which is able to bind to its cognate receptor and regulate gene transcription. Modulation of this pre-receptor activation mechanism by selective enzyme inhibitors is a desirable goal in the treatment of insulin resistance and related metabolic disorders. Like most other hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases 11beta-HSD1 belongs to the evolutionarily conserved enzyme superfamily of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR). The enzyme is anchored within the endoplasmic reticulum through an N-terminal transmembrane domain. In this study we aimed to characterize the active site of mammalian 11beta-HSD1 by determining primary structures from several mammalian lines (cat, hamster, cynomolgus, chimpanzee, dog) thus increasing substantially available sequence information, and allowing us to determine highly variable and constant parts within the primary structure. These regions were mapped to the recently determined three-dimensional structure and are mostly found around the substrate binding site. Furthermore we performed inhibition studies by using different series of inhibitors, comprising 11beta-HSD1 selective arylsulfonamidothiazoles and the unselective steroid-based compound carbenoxolone. The different arylsulfonamidothiazoles display distinct inhibition profiles versus the mammalian species tested, with several tight binding inhibitors for the human enzyme (Ki approximately 50 nM), intermediate for mouse, and weak or not binding inhibitors for rat and guinea pig (Ki>3 microM). Analysis of the inhibition mode reveals that the tight binding inhibitor BVT.528 is a competitive inhibitor for the human form, whereas the related compound BVT.2733 displays a mixed-type inhibition pattern versus the mouse enzyme. Taken together, this structure-activity study provides increased insight into active site complexity and catalytic mechanism of 11beta-HSD1, useful for further inhibitor design.

207365|t|Calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 binding proteins in human placenta.
207365|a|The placental translocation of calcium is a well-known process, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Placental cytoplasmic proteins capable of binding calcium and the active metabolites of vitamin D3 were sought in these studies. Cytosol from full-term human placenta was prepared by ultracentrifugation of homogenates and tested for binding. Partial purification by column chromatography revealed the presence of two discrete proteins which bound specifically 45Ca and 3H-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and having approximate molecular weights of 12,000 and 67,000, respectively. These placental proteins may be intermediaries in the process of placental calcium translocation.

8822708|t|Immunohistochemical localization of nitric oxide synthase activity in upper respiratory epithelium.
8822708|a|Nitric oxide (NO) production in the respiratory epithelium of the upper airways has recently been described. To better delineate the role of epithelial NO, the authors of this study attempted to identify the cell type responsible for the production of NO in rat tracheal epithelium and human nasal epithelium. They localized the activity of NO through immunohistochemical analysis with an antibody to L-citrulline, a marker for activity of the L-arginine-dependent nitric oxide synthase (NOS) pathway. Using anti-inducible NOS (iNOS) and anti-constitutive NOS (cNOS) antibodies, they also attempted to identify the specific NO isotypes that were present. The tracheal and nasal epithelium demonstrated strong immunoreactivity to citrulline in ciliated cells. The ciliated cells of the nasal turbinates demonstrated strong iNOS positivity, but no significant cNOS immunoreactivity. The study findings that iNOS activity is present in ciliated epithelial cells of rat and human upper respiratory epithelium suggest that NO may play a role in epithelial homeostasis and could potentially play a role in the pathogenesis of mucociliary dysfunction.

11893856|t|Hydrogen peroxide reverses IL-5 afforded eosinophil survival and promotes constitutive human eosinophil apoptosis.
11893856|a|BACKGROUND: Eosinophils play a central role in the induction and perpetuation of allergic inflammatory responses. The present study was performed to investigate the effects of reactive oxygen intermediates on constitutive apoptosis as well as on interleukin (IL)-5 afforded human eosinophil survival. METHODS: Peripheral blood eosinophils were isolated by CD16-negative selection to >99% purity and were cultured for 48 h. The number of apoptotic eosinophils in the culture was assessed by flow cytometric analysis of relative DNA content in propidium-iodide-stained cells, annexin-V binding or by morphological analysis. Apoptosis was confirmed by the appearance of a typical ladder pattern in the DNA fragmentation assay by agarose gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: Exogenous H(2)O(2) reversed IL-5-afforded eosinophil survival by inducing apoptosis. Constitutive eosinophil apoptosis was inhibited by a reduction of intracellular levels of H(2)O(2) by catalase. Exogenous H(2)O(2) increased the rate of constitutive apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that H(2)O(2) may play a role in the downregulation of eosinophilic inflammation by inducing eosinophil apoptosis.

15797841|t|A direct nitric oxide gas delivery system for bacterial and mammalian cell cultures.
15797841|a|Nitric oxide (NO) is the smallest known gaseous signaling molecule released by mammalian and plant cells. To investigate the pathophysiologic role of exogenous NO gas (gNO) in bacterial and mammalian cell cultures, a validated in vitro delivery method is required. The system should be able to deliver gNO directly to bacterial and/or cell cultures in a continuous, predictable, and reproducible manner over a long period of time (days). To accomplish this, a gas delivery system was designed to provide optimal growth conditions for bacteria and/or mammalian cells. Parameters for cell exposure, such as concentration of gNO, nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), oxygen (O(2)), temperature, and relative humidity (RH) were continuously monitored and evaluated. Uptake of gNO into various media was monitored by measuring the nitrite concentration using the Griess reagent technique. A selection of standard growth media [saline, tryptic soy broth (TSB), Middlebrook 7H9 (MB 7H9), and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)] exposed to various concentrations of gNO revealed a steady and consistent transfer of gNO into the aqueous phase over a 48-h period. Validation of optimal growth conditions within the device, as compared to a conventional incubator, were accomplished by growing and observing viability of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and human fibroblast cultures in the absence of gNO. These results indicate that an optimal growth environment for the above tested cells was accomplished inside the proposed delivery system. Dose-dependent toxicological data revealed a significant bacteriostatic effect on P. aeruginosa and S. aureus with continuous exposure to 80 ppm gNO. No toxic effects were observed on dermal fibroblast proliferation at concentrations up to 400 ppm gNO for 48 h. In conclusion, the designed gNO exposure system is capable of supporting cellular viability for a representative range of prokaryote and eukaryotic cells. The exposure system is also capable of obtaining toxicological data. Therefore, the proposed device can be utilized to continuously expose cells to various levels of gNO for up to 72 h to study the in vitro effects of gNO therapy.

10490609|t|Clustered adenine/thymine stretches are essential for function of a fission yeast replication origin.
10490609|a|We have determined functional elements required for autonomous replication of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe ars2004 that acts as an intrinsic chromosomal replication origin. Internal deletion analysis of a 940-bp fragment (ars2004M) showed three regions, I to III, to be required for autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) activity. Eight-base-pair substitutions in the 40-bp region I, composed of arrays of adenines on a DNA strand, resulted in a great reduction of ARS activity. Substitutions of region I with synthetic sequences showed that no specific sequence but rather repeats of three or more consecutive adenines or thymines, without interruption by guanine or cytosine, are required for the ARS activity. The 65-bp region III contains 11 repeats of the AAAAT sequence, while the 165-bp region II has short adenine or thymine stretches and a guanine- and cytosine-rich region which enhances ARS activity. All three regions in ars2004M can be replaced with 40-bp poly(dA/dT) fragments without reduction of ARS activity. Although spacer regions in the ars2004M enhance ARS activity, all could be deleted when an 40-bp poly(dA/dT) fragment was added in place of region I. Our results suggest that the origin activity of fission yeast replicators depends on the number of adenine/thymine stretches, the extent of their clustering, and presence of certain replication-enhancing elements.

9988368|t|Enzyme-based assay for quantification of paraoxon in blood of parathion poisoned patients.
9988368|a|1. Paraoxon concentration was estimated by means of inhibition kinetics observed with electric eel acetylcholinesterase (AChE) which was determined by a modified Ellman procedure. In human plasma, paraoxon was stabilized by inactivation of paraoxonase with EDTA and aluminon and by inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase with ethopropazine. Paraoxon (1-50 ng) was recovered at 86+/-1.7% (mean+/-s.e.m.) in ether extracts from 0.5 ml samples of spiked stabilized plasma. It could be stored without loss at - 20 degrees C for at least 1 month. 2. The enzyme-based assay was applied to follow the paraoxon plasma concentrations in three suicidal patients with severe parathion poisoning. In poisoning with excessive doses and initial paraoxon concentrations above 500 nM, therapeutic obidoxime concentrations of approximately 10 microM failed to essentially reactivate erythrocyte AChE in vivo, while reactivatability ex vivo was nearly complete. With the plasma concentrations of paraoxon dropping below 100 nM, however, reactivation by obidoxime became significant. Unexpectedly, paraoxon levels occasionally reincreased during treatment and resulted in re-inhibition of AChE, bearing some resemblance to the Intermediate Syndrome. 3. The paraoxon concentrations measured fitted satisfactorily the values calculated from the kinetic constants previously obtained for AChE inhibition and obidoxime-induced reactivation in vitro. This indicates that diethylphosphoryloxime formation during obidoxime-induced reactivation does not markedly contribute to the re-inhibition of AChE as observed in vitro.

24927729|t|Structural characterization of human cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase.
24927729|a|Hepatic conversion to bile acids is a major elimination route for cholesterol in mammals. CYP7A1 catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in classic bile acid biosynthesis, converting cholesterol to 7α-hydroxycholesterol. To identify the structural determinants that govern the stereospecific hydroxylation of cholesterol, we solved the crystal structure of CYP7A1 in the ligand-free state. The structure-based mutation T104L in the B' helix, corresponding to the nonpolar residue of CYP7B1, was used to obtain crystals of complexes with cholest-4-en-3-one and with cholesterol oxidation product 7-ketocholesterol (7KCh). The structures reveal a motif of residues that promote cholest-4-en-3-one binding parallel to the heme, thus positioning the C7 atom for hydroxylation. Additional regions of the binding cavity (most distant from the access channel) are involved to accommodate the elongated conformation of the aliphatic side chain. Structural complex with 7KCh shows an active site rigidity and provides an explanation for its inhibitory effect. Based on our previously published data, we proposed a model of cholesterol abstraction from the membrane by CYP7A1 for metabolism. CYP7A1 structural data provide a molecular basis for understanding of the diversity of 7α-hydroxylases, on the one hand, and cholesterol-metabolizing enzymes adapted for their specific activity, on the other hand.

10747906|t|NADPH oxidase activation increases the sensitivity of intracellular Ca2+ stores to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in human endothelial cells.
10747906|a|Many stimuli that activate the vascular NADPH oxidase generate reactive oxygen species and increase intracellular Ca(2+), but whether NADPH oxidase activation directly affects Ca(2+) signaling is unknown. NADPH stimulated the production of superoxide anion and H(2)O(2) in human aortic endothelial cells that was inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium and was significantly attenuated in cells transiently expressing a dominant negative allele of the small GTP-binding protein Rac1, which is required for oxidase activity. In permeabilized Mag-indo 1-loaded cells, NADPH and H(2)O(2) each decreased the threshold concentration of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP(3)) required to release intracellularly stored Ca(2+) and shifted the InsP(3)-Ca(2+) release dose-response curve to the left. Concentrations of H(2)O(2) as low as 3 microm increased the sensitivity of intracellular Ca(2+) stores to InsP(3) and decreased the InsP(3) EC(50) from 423.2 +/- 54.9 to 276.9 +/- 14. 4 nm. The effect of NADPH on InsP(3)-stimulated Ca(2+) release was blocked by catalase and by diphenyleneiodonium and was not observed in cells lacking functional Rac1 protein. Thus, NADPH oxidase-derived H(2)O(2) increases the sensitivity of intracellular Ca(2+) stores to InsP(3) in human endothelial cells. Since Ca(2+)-dependent signaling pathways are critical to normal endothelial function, this effect may be of great importance in endothelial signal transduction.

19039621|t|Optical properties, physiologic parameters and tissue composition of the human uterine cervix as a function of hormonal status.
19039621|a|The influence of sex hormones on the human uterine cervix is likely to be important in the process of cervical ripening. Frequency domain near-infrared spectroscopy (FD-NIRS) was used to investigate non-invasively the changes in the optical properties that reflect physiologic parameters and tissue composition of the uterine cervix in the different phases of the menstrual cycle. Twenty premenopausal and nine postmenopausal women were examined. Optical properties of the uterine cervix were measured, and physiological parameters [concentration of water, oxyhemoglobin (O(2)Hb) and deoxyhemoglobin (HHb), total hemoglobin (tHb), oxygen saturation (StO(2)), water, and scattering power] were calculated. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for statistical significance. The optical properties of the anterior cervical lip did not differ from those of the posterior lip. HHb was significantly lower in cervices during menstrual bleeding than during the follicular, luteal, or postmenopausal phases. The ratio of O(2)Hb to HHb was highly significantly increased by a factor of 2 when cervices during the menstrual bleeding were compared with those during the follicular, luteal, or postmenopausal phases. The scattering power was significantly lower during menstrual bleeding than during the follicular or postmenopausal phases. We demonstrated that withdrawal of sex hormones during menstrual bleeding is associated with a significant decrease in HHb and scattering power, with stable values of O(2)Hb, tHb, StO(2), and H(2)O compared with the values during the follicular, luteal or postmenopausal phases of the menstrual cycle. Cervical softening during menstrual bleeding seems to be different from cervical softening for labor.

2226329|t|Insulin-like growth factor type I increases concentrations of messenger ribonucleic acid encoding cytochrome P450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme in primary cultures of porcine granulosa cells.
2226329|a|Insulin-like growth factor type I (IGF-I) is an important intraovarian peptide that stimulates granulosa cell steroidogenesis during follicular development. The cytochrome P450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc) that converts cholesterol to pregnenolone is the rate-limiting step in progesterone biosynthesis. Since treatment of primary cultures of immature porcine granulosa cells with IGF-I will increase progesterone production as well as the synthesis of immunoprecipitable P450scc enzyme, we examined possible molecular mechanisms subserving these inductive effects of IGF-I. To this end, cultures of porcine granulosa cells were maintained in serum-free medium with or without IGF-I under various treatment paradigms. Cellular concentrations of specific P450scc mRNA were measured by Northern blot hybridization using a 32P-labeled 1-kilobase porcine cDNA clone. Northern blot autoradiogram densitometry data were normalized with a constitutively expressed 1.2-kilobase chicken glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA clone. Steroidogenesis was monitored by measuring concomitant progesterone accumulation in the culture medium. Treatment with pure recombinant human IGF-I (100 ng/ml) significantly increased P450scc mRNA concentrations after 18 h, and maximal stimulation (10- to 20-fold) occurred by 48 h for both P450scc mRNA and progesterone accumulation. The IGF-I dose-response curve studied at 48 h showed a significant increase in P450scc mRNA levels at a minimal IGF-I concentration of 1 ng/ml (although progesterone production was not increased). Treatment with equimolar concentrations of epidermal growth factor, IGF-I, or insulin significantly increased P450scc mRNA concentrations, whereas fibroblast growth factor did not. To examine possible mechanisms underlying stimulation of P450scc by IGF-I, immature granulosa cells were treated with aminoglutethimide (a P450scc enzyme inhibitor), low density lipoprotein (to increase cholesterol delivery to granulosa cells), or estradiol in the presence or absence of IGF-I. Aminoglutethimide had no effect, alone or with IGF-I, on P450scc mRNA concentrations, but suppressed progesterone production. Low density lipoprotein alone also did not stimulate P450scc mRNA levels and only slightly increased progesterone accumulation, but acted synergistically with IGF-I to augment P450scc mRNA concentrations and progesterone accumulation. Estradiol alone did not stimulate P450scc mRNA concentrations, but did significantly increase progesterone production. Estradiol cotreatment with IGF-I synergistically enhanced progesterone production, but did not alter IGF-I-stimulated P450scc mRNA concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

26111628|t|Hydrogen Sulfide Ameliorates Early Brain Injury Following Subarachnoid Hemorrhage in Rats.
26111628|a|Increasing studies have demonstrated the neuroprotective effect of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in central nervous system (CNS) diseases. However, the potential application value of H2S in the therapy of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is still not well known. This study was to investigate the potential effect of H2S on early brain injury (EBI) induced by SAH and explore the underlying mechanisms. The role of sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), a donor of H2S, in SAH-induced EBI, was investigated in both in vivo and in vitro. A prechiasmatic cistern single injection model was used to produce experimental SAH in vivo. In vitro, cultured primary rat cortical neurons and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to OxyHb at concentration of 10 μM to mimic SAH. Endogenous production of H2S in the brain was significantly inhibited by SAH. The protein levels of the predominant H2S-generating enzymes in the brain, including cystathionineb-synthase (CBS) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferase (3MST), were also correspondingly reduced by SAH, while treatment with NaHS restored H2S production and the expressions of CBS and 3MST. More importantly, NaHS treatment could significantly attenuate EBI (including brain edema, blood-brain barrier disruption, brain cell apoptosis, inflammatory response, and cerebral vasospasm) after SAH. In vitro, H2S protects neurons and endothelial function by functioning as an antioxidant and antiapoptotic mediator. Our results suggest that NaSH as an exogenous H2S donor could significantly reduce EBI induced by SAH.

22609709|t|Co-fermentation of cellobiose and xylose by Lipomyces starkeyi for lipid production.
22609709|a|Hydrolysates of lignocellulosic biomass contain glucose, xylose, arabinose, cellobiose, among other sugars. Effective utilization of these sugars remains challenging for microbial conversion, because most microorganisms consume such sugars sequentially with a strong preference for glucose. In the present study, the oleaginous yeast, Lipomyces starkeyi, was shown to consume cellobiose and xylose simultaneously and to produce intracellular lipids from cellobiose, xylose and glucose. In flask cultures with glucose, cellobiose or a mixture of cellobiose/xylose as carbon sources, overall substrate consumption rates were close to 0.6 g/L/h, and lipid coefficients were 0.19 g lipid/g sugar, respectively. This cellobiose/xylose co-fermentation strategy provides an opportunity to efficiently utilize lignocellulosic biomass for microbial lipid production, which is important for biorefinery and biofuel production.

10520813|t|Gene transfer of nitric oxide synthase: effects on endothelial biology.
10520813|a|OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to investigate the role of nitric oxide (NO) in monocyte-endothelial interaction by augmenting NO release via transfection of human endothelial cells (ECs) with EC NO synthase (eNOS) DNA. BACKGROUND: Enhancement of NO synthesis by L-arginine or shear stress reduces endothelial adhesiveness for monocytes and inhibits atherogenesis. To elucidate further the underlying mechanism, we augmented NO synthase expression by transfection of human EC. METHODS: Liposome-mediated transfection of EC was performed with a plasmid construct containing the gene encoding eNOS. Expression of eNOS was confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Endothelial cells were exposed to human monocytoid cells, and adherent cells were quantitated using a computer-assisted program. Nitric oxide was measured by chemiluminescence. RESULTS: The NO levels were not different in EC that were either not transfected, transfected with beta-gal or liposomes only. The nitric oxide synthase (NOS) transfection increased NO release by +60% (n = 6), which increased further when EC were stimulated by shear stress (24 h) by +137% (n = 5) as compared with untransfected, unstimulated EC (both p < 0.05). The RT-PCR revealed diminished monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) expression in eNOS transfected EC. There was an inverse relation between NO levels and monocyte binding (r = -0.5669, p < 0.002). Stimulation of EC with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha; 250 U/ml) led to a decrease in NO synthesis, and an increase in monocyte binding. Cells transfected with NOS were resistant to both effects of TNF-alpha. CONCLUSIONS: Endothelial cells transfected with eNOS synthesize an increased amount of NO; this is associated with diminished MCP-1 expression and monocyte-endothelial binding. The reduction in monocyte-endothelial binding persists even after cytokine stimulation.

8579948|t|Postparturient hypocalcemia of dairy cows: a model for the study of the interdependence of Ca, Pi, and Mg homeostasis.
8579948|a|Disorders of calcium, phosphorus and magnesium homeostasis in ruminants provide natural models for the study of the physiology and pathophysiology of these minerals. The knowledge that can be acquired with a better understanding of the pathogenesis of these diseases could give useful clues in the puzzle of human osteoporosis. In the present study, the case of parturient paresis of dairy cows is reexamined with a newly developed technique for the measurements of serum ionized magnesium concentrations (Mg2+). The concentrations of total magnesium (Mgtot), ionized calcium (Ca2+), total calcium (Catot), and inorganic phosphate (Pi) were also determined in the sera of seventeen 3- to 16-year-old Brown Swiss and crossed Simmental/Red Holstein cows during the periparturient period. In each animal, a transient increase of Mg2+ and Mgtot serum concentrations was observed in association with the transient decrease after parturition of Ca2+, Catot and Pi serum concentrations. On average, throughout the study, serum Mg2+ concentrations were 68.5% of those of Mgtot whereas serum Ca2+ concentrations were 52% of those of Catot. The possible mechanisms involved in the transient increase of Mg2+ and Mgtot serum concentrations are discussed and the relevance of this data for osteoporosis is outlined.

12077256|t|Negative feedback regulation of the tumor suppressor PTEN by phosphoinositide-induced serine phosphorylation.
12077256|a|The PTEN tumor suppressor phosphatase directly counteracts the multiple functions of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase by removing phosphate from the D3 position of inositol phospholipids. Like many lymphomas and leukemias, the Jurkat T cell line lacks PTEN protein due to frame-shift mutations in both PTEN alleles and therefore survives in long-term cell culture. We report that PTEN reintroduced into Jurkat was highly phosphorylated on serines 380 and 385 in its C terminus, particularly the former site. Phosphate was also detected at Ser(380) in PTEN in untransformed human T cells. Treatments that reduced the levels of D3-phospholipids in the cells resulted in reduced phosphorylation and accelerated degradation of PTEN. In contrast, expression of inactive PTEN-C124G or coexpression of a constitutively active protein kinase B led to increased phosphorylation and slower degradation of PTEN. These results suggest that PTEN normally is subjected to a feedback mechanism of regulation aimed at maintaining homeostatic levels of D3-phosphoinositides, which are crucial for T cell survival and activation.

22563443|t|Methanol may function as a cross-kingdom signal.
22563443|a|Recently, we demonstrated that leaf wounding results in the synthesis of pectin methylesterase (PME), which causes the plant to release methanol into the air. Methanol emitted by a wounded plant increases the accumulation of methanol-inducible gene mRNA and enhances antibacterial resistance as well as cell-to-cell communication, which facilitates virus spreading in neighboring plants. We concluded that methanol is a signaling molecule involved in within-plant and plant-to-plant communication. Methanol is considered to be a poison in humans because of the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)-mediated conversion of methanol into toxic formaldehyde. However, recent data showed that methanol is a natural compound in normal, healthy humans. These data call into question whether human methanol is a metabolic waste product or whether methanol has specific function in humans. Here, to reveal human methanol-responsive genes (MRGs), we used suppression subtractive hybridization cDNA libraries of HeLa cells lacking ADH and exposed to methanol. This design allowed us to exclude genes involved in formaldehyde and formic acid detoxification from our analysis. We identified MRGs and revealed a correlation between increases in methanol content in the plasma and changes in human leukocyte MRG mRNA levels after fresh salad consumption by volunteers. Subsequently, we showed that the methanol generated by the pectin/PME complex in the gastrointestinal tract of mice induces the up- and downregulation of brain MRG mRNA. We used an adapted Y-maze to measure the locomotor behavior of the mice while breathing wounded plant vapors in two-choice assays. We showed that mice prefer the odor of methanol to other plant volatiles and that methanol changed MRG mRNA accumulation in the mouse brain.We hypothesize that the methanol emitted by wounded plants may have a role in plant-animal signaling. The known positive effect of plant food intake on human health suggests a role for physiological methanol in human gene regulation.

9392076|t|The ALD6 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a cytosolic, Mg(2+)-activated acetaldehyde dehydrogenase.
9392076|a|The deduced translation product of an open reading frame on the left arm of chromosome XVI of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with the systematic name of YPL061w, is 500 amino acids in length and shares significant homology with aldehyde dehydrogenases. Amino acids 2 to 16 of the protein encoded by YPL061w were found to be identical to the N-terminal 15 amino acids of the purified cytosolic, Mg(2+)-activated acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ACDH) of S. cerevisiae. This enzyme is thought to be involved in the production of acetate from which cytosolic acetyl-CoA is then synthesized. Deletion of YPL061w was detrimental to the growth of haploid strains of yeast; an analysis of one deletion mutant revealed a maximum specific growth rate (in complex medium containing glucose) of one-third of that displayed by the wild-type strain. Mutants deleted in YPL061w were also unable to use ethanol as a carbon source. As expected, the cytosolic, Mg(2+)-activated ACDH activity had been lost from the mutants, although the mitochondrial, K(+)-activated ACDH was readily detected.

12676868|t|Involvement of nitric oxide donor compounds in the bactericidal activity of human neutrophils in vitro.
12676868|a|The bactericidal activity of human neutrophils against extracellular and facultatively intracellular bacteria was studied in the presence of the nitric oxide (NO) donors sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1), a molsidomine metabolite. SNP and molsidomine are drugs commonly used as nitrovasodilators in coronary heart disease. It is demonstrated here that the NO donor compounds themselves did not affect the viability and survival of the bacterial strains tested. Neither SNP nor SIN-1 had any effect on the process of bacteria ingestion. In contrast, NO donors enhanced the ability of neutrophils to kill Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris and Salmonella Anatum. However, strains differed in their susceptibility to SNP- and SIN-1-mediated killing by neutrophils. Removal of the superoxide anion reduced the bactericidal activity of SNP- and SIN-1-treated neutrophils against E. coli and S. Anatum. This suggests that the NO derivatives formed in the reaction of NO generated from donors with the reactive oxygen species released by phagocytosed neutrophils potentiate the bactericidal activity of human neutrophils in vitro. The above original observation discussed here suggests clinical significance for the treatment of patients with nitrovasodilators in the course of coronary heart disease therapy.

7277459|t|Pregnancy monitoring in diverse primate species by estrogen and bioactive luteinizing hormone determinations in small volumes of urine.
7277459|a|Immunoreactive estrogen and luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin (LH/CG) bioactivity have been measured throughout pregnancy in diverse primate species with a sample methodological approach utilizing small volumes of urine collected randomly. Total immunoreactive estrogen levels and the relative abundance of component estrogens (estrone, estradiol and estriol) at various stages of gestation were compared in the human, orangutan, pygmy chimpanzee, Douc langur and capuchin. Measurement of urinary LH/CG bioactivity enables an earlier detection of pregnancy when compared to the nonhuman primate pregnancy test. The methods described provide a practical and non-stressful way to detect and monitor pregnancy in widely divergent primate species.

6325325|t|Alteration of steroid hormone sensitivity during the cultivation of human mammary carcinoma cells.
6325325|a|During early cultivation steps of the newly derived and karyotyped human mammary carcinoma line EFM-19, the cells developed faster growth rates and became increasingly less responsive to the presence of serum in the culture medium. No drastic alterations of the morphology and of the karyotype were observed, and carcinoembryogenic antigen remained expressed during the course of the cultivation. In experimental incubations at various time intervals after the explantation, the cell proliferation was analyzed for dose-dependent effects of estradiol, cortisol, progesterone, and testosterone. After 16 wk of cultivation of the stock culture in the presence of estradiol, the cells had acquired a distinct sensitivity to estradiol resulting in permanent growth enhancement. The withdrawal of cortisol from the medium of the stock culture subsequently provoked the loss of the initially noted stimulation of the proliferation by cortisol. The stimulatory effect of progesterone on the proliferation was reversed to inhibition when the stock culture was deprived of cortisol in the growth medium. The results indicate that the choice of steroid hormones in the stock culture medium was determining the quality of the cellular growth responses.

2029647|t|The role of free radicals in myocardial cell injury.
2029647|a|Free radicals can affect lipids of membranes by initiating peroxidation. Since alterations in membrane fluidity can modulate membrane functions including ion permeability, the effects of free radicals on the intracellular Ca2+ level ([Ca2+]i) and membrane fluidity were studied. Human erythrocytes were spin-labeled with 5-DSA and the membrane fluidity was quantified by ESR during application of oxygen-derived free radicals. The morphology was observed by the scanning electron microscopy. The effects of H2O2 on [Ca2+]i were studied using single guinea pig ventricular myocytes and fura-2 AM. Superoxide and H2O2 (10(-3) and 10(-4) M) induced a decrease in membrane fluidity and morphological changes of erythrocytes. [Ca2+]i significantly increased from the control value (53 +/- 4 nmol/litre) to 110 +/- 29 nmol/litre when the cells were shortened, and to 130 +/- 26 nmol/litre before cells became rounded. This study showed that [Ca2+]i was significantly increased by oxygen-derived free radicals, possibly by lipid peroxidation of the cell membrane. During perfusion with H2O2 however, the increase in [Ca2+]i was not pronounced. Therefore, we suspect that the mechanism of cell injury due to free radicals may be a combination of direct cell membrane injury and Ca2+ overload rather than intracellular Ca2+ overload.

1721495|t|Cytokine-induced phagocyte adhesion to human mesangial cells: role of CD11/CD18 integrins and ICAM-1.
1721495|a|We examined the actions of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) on neutrophil and monocyte (phagocyte) adhesion to human mesangial cell monolayers (HMC) and assessed the role of phagocyte CD11/CD18 integrin adhesion molecules and HMC intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in this process, using subunit specific monoclonal antibodies (MAb). TNF, but not IL-1, provoked rapid (onset less than 1 min) neutrophil and monocyte adhesion to HMC by a phagocyte-directed action. Adhesion was markedly inhibited by MAb against CD18 and CD11b, with lesser or no inhibition being afforded by MAb against CD11a, CD11c, or ICAM-1. In contrast, prolonged exposure of HMC to TNF or IL-1 (1-18 h) increased HMC adhesiveness for phagocytes. These actions were blocked by actinomycin D or cycloheximide and by MAb against HMC ICAM-1 or phagocyte CD18, CD11a, or CD11b, suggesting that cytokines provoked adhesion by inducing HMC ICAM-1 synthesis. In keeping with this interpretation, TNF treatment of HMC was associated with increased ICAM-1 surface expression, as determined by indirect immunofluorescence, and increased ICAM-1 mRNA levels, as determined by Northern blot analysis. The actions of TNF on phagocytes and HMC were additive. HMC injury, as determined by 51Cr release, was only observed when both phagocytes and HMC were activated by TNF. HMC injury was attenuated by anti-CD18 MAb and superoxide dismutase, suggesting that the injury process was, in part, adhesion dependent and mediated by reactive oxygen species.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

4877682|t|Antibacterial activity of human urine.
4877682|a|The fate of bacteria in human urine was studied after inoculation of small numbers of Escherichia coli and other bacterial strains commonly implicated in urinary tract infection. Urine from normal individuals was often inhibitory and sometimes bactericidal for growth of these organisms. Antibacterial activity of urine was not related to lack of nutrient material as addition of broth did not decrease inhibitory activity. Antibacterial activity was correlated with osmolality, urea concentration and ammonium concentration, but not with organic acid, sodium, or potassium concentration. Between a pH range of 5.0-6.5 antibacterial activity of urine was greater at lower pH. Ultrafiltration and column chromatography to remove protein did not decrease antibacterial activity. Urea concentration was a more important determinant of antibacterial activity than osmolality or ammonium concentration. Increasing the urea of a noninhibitory urine to equal that of an inhibitory urine made the urine inhibitory. However, increasing osmolality (with sodium chloride) or increasing ammonium to equal the osmolality or ammonium of an inhibitory urine did not increase antibacterial activity. Similarly, dialysis to decrease osmolality or ammonium but preserve urea did not decrease inhibitory activity. Decreasing urea with preservation of ammonium and osmolality decreased antibacterial activity. Removal of ammonium with an ion exchanger did not decrease antibacterial activity, whereas conversion of urea to ammonium with urease and subsequent removal of the ammonium decreased antibacterial activity. Urine collected from volunteers after ingestion of urea demonstrated a marked increase in antibacterial activity, as compared with urine collected before ingestion of urea.

24090988|t|A chlorhexidine-loaded biodegradable cellulosic device for periodontal pockets treatment.
24090988|a|Absorbent points widely used in endodontic therapy were transformed into bioresorbable chlorhexidine delivery systems for the treatment of the periodontal pocket by preventing its recolonization by the subgingival microflora. These paper points (PPs) were first oxidized to promote their resorption, then grafted with β-cyclodextrin (CD) or maltodextrin (MD) in order to achieve sustained delivery of chlorhexidine. We investigated the oxidation step parameters through the time of reaction and the nitric and phosphoric acid ratios in the oxidizing mixture, and then the dextrin grafting step parameters through the time and temperature of reaction. A first selection of the appropriate functionalization parameters was undertaken in relation to the degradation profile kinetics of the oxidized (PPO) and oxidized-grafted samples (PPO-CD and PPO-MD). Samples were then loaded with chlorhexidine digluconate (digCHX), a widely used antiseptic agent in periodontal therapy. The release kinetics of digCHX from PPO-CD and PPO-MD samples were compared to PP, PPO and to PerioChip(®) (a commercial digCHX containing gelatine chip) in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) by ultraviolet spectrophotometry. The cytocompatibility of the oxidized-grafted PP was demonstrated by cell proliferation assays. Finally, the disc diffusion test from digCHX loaded PPO-MD samples immersed in human plasma was developed on pre-inoculated agar plates with four common periodontal pathogenic strains: Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella melaninogenica, Aggregatibacter actinomycetem comitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis. To conclude, the optimized oxidized-dextrin-grafted PPs responded to our initial specifications in terms of resorption and digCHX release rates and therefore could be adopted as a reliable complementary periodontal therapy.

15205258|t|SOD2-deficiency anemia: protein oxidation and altered protein expression reveal targets of damage, stress response, and antioxidant responsiveness.
15205258|a|SOD2 is an antioxidant protein that protects cells against mitochondrial superoxide. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) lacking SOD2 are capable of rescuing lethally irradiated hosts, but reconstituted animals display a persistent hemolytic anemia characterized by increased oxidative damage to red cells, with morphologic similarity to human "sideroblastic" anemia. We report further characterization of this novel SOD2-deficiency anemia. Electron micrographs of SOD2-deficient reticulocytes reveal striking mitochondrial proliferation and mitochondrial membrane thickening. Peripheral blood smears show abundant iron-stainable granules in mature red cells (siderocytes). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of cells labeled with oxidation-sensitive dyes demonstrates enhanced production of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide by SOD2-deficient cells. Oxidative damage to proteins is increased in SOD2-deficient cells, with much of the damage affecting membrane/insoluble proteins. Red cell proteome analysis demonstrates that several proteins involved in folding/chaperone function, redox regulation, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, and red cell metabolism show altered expression in SOD2-deficient cells. This data, combined with information on how protein expression levels change upon antioxidant therapy, will aid in identification of proteins that are sensitive to oxidative damage in this model, and by extension, may have a role in the regulation of red cell lifespan in other hemolytic disorders.

25324547|t|Polynucleotide 3'-terminal phosphate modifications by RNA and DNA ligases.
25324547|a|RNA and DNA ligases catalyze the formation of a phosphodiester bond between the 5'-phosphate and 3'-hydroxyl ends of nucleic acids. In this work, we describe the ability of the thermophilic RNA ligase MthRnl from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum to recognize and modify the 3'-terminal phosphate of RNA and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). This ligase can use an RNA 3'p substrate to generate an RNA 2',3'-cyclic phosphate or convert DNA3'p to ssDNA(3')pp(5')A. An RNA ligase from the Thermus scotoductus bacteriophage TS2126 and a predicted T4 Rnl1-like protein from Thermovibrio ammonificans, TVa, were also able to adenylate ssDNA 3'p. These modifications of RNA and DNA 3'-phosphates are similar to the activities of RtcA, an RNA 3'-phosphate cyclase. The initial step involves adenylation of the enzyme by ATP, which is then transferred to either RNA 3'p or DNA 3'p to generate the adenylated intermediate. For RNA (3')pp(5')A, the third step involves attack of the adjacent 2' hydroxyl to generate the RNA 2',3'-cyclic phosphate. These steps are analogous to those in classical 5' phosphate ligation. MthRnl and TS2126 RNA ligases were not able to modify a 3'p in nicked double-stranded DNA. However, T4 DNA ligase and RtcA can use 3'-phosphorylated nicks in double-stranded DNA to produce a 3'-adenylated product. These 3'-terminal phosphate-adenylated intermediates are substrates for deadenylation by yeast 5'Deadenylase. Our findings that classic ligases can duplicate the adenylation and phosphate cyclization activity of RtcA suggests that they have an essential role in metabolism of nucleic acids with 3'-terminal phosphates.

17340635|t|Crystal structure of human myo-inositol monophosphatase 2, the product of the putative susceptibility gene for bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and febrile seizures.
17340635|a|The human IMPA2 gene, which encodes myo-inositol monophosphatase 2 (IMPA2), is mapped onto 18p11.2, a susceptibility region for bipolar disorder. This chromosomal region has also been proposed to include a susceptibility locus for schizophrenia and febrile seizures. Here we report the crystal structures of human IMPA2 and its complex with calcium and phosphate ions. Human IMPA2 comprises an alpha-beta protein with a five-layered sandwich of alpha-helices and beta-sheets (alpha-beta-alpha-beta-alpha). The crystal structure and analytical ultracentrifugation results indicated that IMPA2 exists as a dimer in solution. The overall structure of IMPA2 is similar to that of IMPA1, except for the loop regions. In IMPA1, the loop region (31-43) is located at the entrance of the active site cavity. In the corresponding region (42-54) of IMPA2, the residues are disordered and partially form an alpha-helix. The structural difference in the opening of the active site cavity suggests that the substrate specificity differs between IMPA1 and IMPA2. The widely opened cavity of IMPA2 implies that the physiological substrate may be a larger compound than inositol monophosphate. The structure of IMPA2 complexed with Ca2+ revealed two metals and one phosphate binding sites, which were the same sites as in IMPA1 complexed with Mn2+ and phosphate, suggesting that the mechanism of the enzymatic reaction is similar to that of IMPA1. The crystal structures of human IMPA2 are useful for understanding the effect of nonsynonymous polymorphism reported in IMPA2, and will contribute to further functional analyses of IMPA2 that potentially predisposes to the vulnerabilities of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and febrile seizures.

7402082|t|Testosterone and 17 beta-oestradiol secretion of the human ovary. I. normal young women, and premenopausal women with endometrial hyperplasia.
7402082|a|Testosterone and 17 beta-oestradiol were determined in blood obtained from the ovarian veins of 26 women, 16 of whom were young and regularly ovulating and menstruating, and 10 of whom were premenopausal with uterine bleedings and endometrial hyperplasia. The concentrations of these two hormones in the cubital veins of the premenopausal women were also determined. It was found that the concentrations of the two hormones were not significantly greater in the premenopausal women than in the control group of young normally ovulating and menstruating women in the periovulatory phase of the menstural cycle, but that the ovarian secretion rates of both hormones, particularly of testosterone, were considerably greater in the premenopausal women. In these women the concentrations of both hormones were significantly lower in the cubital veins than in the ovarian veins. The conclusion is that the augmented oestrogenic effect on the endometrium and on other target organs of premenopausal women with endometrial hyperplasia may be due not only to an increased ovarian secretion rate of estradiol, but also and more specifically to an increased ovarian secretion rate of testosterone, and to the rapid vonversion of this hormone into oestradiol in the periphery.

9163065|t|Sphingosine-containing phospholipid vesicles support human factor VII autoactivation in the absence of tissue factor.
9163065|a|We studied the effects of lipid membrane composition on factor VII autoactivation and observed that factor VII was activated in the presence of phospholipid vesicles containing sphingosine. The time course for the factor VII activation was sigmoidal and the duration of the initial lag phase was decreased by the addition of exogenous factor VIIA. Kinetic studies revealed that factor VII activation in the presence of sphingosine-containing phospholipids can be defined by a second-order reaction mechanism with an apparent second-order rate constant of 1.1x10(4) M(-1)s(-1). The sphingosine-mediated factor VII autoactivation rate was dependent on the concentration of calcium ions and sphingosine content of the vesicles. Neither bovine serum albumin-conjugated sphingosine nor sphingosine analogues (ceramide, sphingomyelin) affected the factor VII autoactivation rate.

25427903|t|The role of iron in alcohol-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis.
25427903|a|Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is the major liver disease in the developed world and characterized by hepatic iron overload in ca. 50% of all patients. This iron overload is an independent factor of disease progression, hepatocellular carcinoma and it determines survival. Since simple phlebotomy does not allow the efficient removal of excess iron in ALD, a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms is urgently needed to identify novel targeted treatment strategies. This review summarizes the present knowledge on iron overload in patients with ALD. Although multiple sides of the cellular and systemic iron homeostasis may be affected during alcohol consumption, most studies have focused on potential hepatic causes. However, it should not be overlooked that more than 90% of the major iron pool, the hemoglobin-associated iron, is efficiently recycled within the human body and it is also strongly affected by alcohol. The few available studies suggest various molecular mechanisms that involve iron regulatory protein (IRP1), transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), and the systemic iron master switch hepcidin, but not classical mutations of the HFE gene. Notably, reactive oxygen species (ROS), namely, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), are powerful modulators of these iron-steering proteins. For instance, depending on the level, H2O2 may both strongly suppress and induce the expression of hepcidin that could partly explain the anemia and iron overload observed in these patients. More studies with appropriate ROS models such as the novel GOX/CAT system are required to unravel the mechanisms of iron overload in ALD to consequently identify molecular-targeted therapies in the future.

21296054|t|O2-mediated oxidation of ferrous nitrosylated human serum heme-albumin is limited by nitrogen monoxide dissociation.
21296054|a|Human serum heme-albumin (HSA-heme-Fe) displays globin-like properties. Here, kinetics of O(2)-mediated oxidation of ferrous nitrosylated HSA-heme-Fe (HSA-heme-Fe(II)-NO) is reported. Values of the first-order rate constants for O(2)-mediated oxidation of HSA-heme-Fe(II)-NO (i.e., for ferric HSA-heme-Fe formation) and for NO dissociation from HSA-heme-Fe(II)-NO (i.e., for NO replacement by CO) are k=9.8 × 10(-5) and 8.3 × 10(-4) s(-1), and h=1.3 × 10(-4) and 8.5 × 10(-4) s(-1), in the absence and presence of rifampicin, respectively, at pH=7.0 and T=20.0 °C. The coincidence of values of k and h indicates that NO dissociation represents the rate limiting step of O(2)-mediated oxidation of HSA-heme-Fe(II)-NO. Mixing HSA-heme-Fe(II)-NO with O(2) does not lead to the formation of the transient adduct(s), but leads to the final ferric HSA-heme-Fe derivative. These results reflect the fast O(2)-mediated oxidation of ferrous HSA-heme-Fe and highlight the role of drugs in modulating allosterically the heme-Fe-atom reactivity.

15044461|t|Neuropathy target esterase and its yeast homologue degrade phosphatidylcholine to glycerophosphocholine in living cells.
15044461|a|Eukaryotic cells control the levels of their major membrane lipid, phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), by balancing synthesis with degradation via deacylation to glycerophosphocholine (GroPCho). Here we present evidence that in both yeast and mammalian cells this deacylation is catalyzed by neuropathy target esterase (NTE), a protein originally identified by its reaction with organophosphates, which cause nerve axon degeneration. YML059c, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein with sequence homology to NTE, had similar catalytic properties to the mammalian enzyme in assays of microsome preparations and, like NTE, was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. Yeast lacking YML059c were viable under all conditions examined but, unlike the wild-type strain, did not convert PtdCho to GroPCho. Despite the absence of the deacylation pathway, the net rate of [(14)C]choline incorporation into PtdCho in YML059c-null yeast was not greater than that in the wild type; this was because, in the null strain diminished net uptake of extracellular choline and decreased formation of the rate-limiting intermediate, CDP-choline, resulted in a reduced rate of PtdCho synthesis. In [(14)C]choline labeling experiments with cultured mammalian cell lines, production of [(14)C]GroPCho was enhanced by overexpression of catalytically active NTE and was diminished by reduction of endogenous NTE activity mediated either by RNA interference or organophosphate treatment. We conclude that NTE and its homologues play a central role in membrane lipid homeostasis.

27995355|a|pcyd: 3,5-dichloro phenylcyanamide) have been synthesized and fully characterized. Cellular uptake, DNA platination and cytotoxicity against a panel of human tumor cell lines were evaluated. The complexes 1-3 revealed a significant in vitro antiproliferative activity against human ovarian carcinoma (A2780), colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT29), breast (MCF-7), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG-2) and lung adenocarcinoma (A549) cancer cell lines. All the complexes are more active than cisplatin and follow the trend 1 > 2 > 3. Mechanistic studies showed that the trend in cytotoxicity of the Pt(II) complexes is mainly consistent with their ability to accumulate into cancer cells and to increase intracellular basal reactive oxygen species levels, which consequently results in the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis induction. The complex 1 caused to approximately 80-fold higher DNA platination level with respect to cisplatin. The complexes 1-3 can considerably stimulate the production of hydrogen peroxide in a time-dependent manner. Also, the complexes 1-3 induced an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production that was superior to that induced by antimycin. The complex 1 had the most effect on ROS production in comparison with other complexes.

8144674|t|Specificity of coenzyme binding in thiamin diphosphate-dependent enzymes. Crystal structures of yeast transketolase in complex with analogs of thiamin diphosphate.
8144674|a|The three-dimensional structures of complexes of yeast apotransketolase with the coenzyme analogs 6'-methyl, N1'-pyridyl, and N3'-pyridyl thiamin diphosphate, respectively, were determined with protein crystallographic methods. All three coenzyme analogs bind to the enzyme in a fashion highly similar to the cofactor thiamin diphosphate. Thus, either one of the hydrogen bonds of the pyrimidine ring nitrogens to the protein is sufficient for proper binding and positioning of the cofactor. The lack of catalytic activity of the N3'-pyridyl analog is not due to incorrect orientation of the pyrimidine ring, but results from the absence of the hydrogen bond between the N1' nitrogen atom and the conserved residue Glu418. The structure analysis provides further evidence for the importance of this conserved interaction for enzymatic thiamin catalysis.

23517093|t|Genomics-guided discovery of thailanstatins A, B, and C As pre-mRNA splicing inhibitors and antiproliferative agents from Burkholderia thailandensis MSMB43.
23517093|a|Mining the genome sequence of Burkholderia thailandensis MSMB43 revealed a cryptic biosynthetic gene cluster resembling that of FR901464 (4), a prototype spliceosome inhibitor produced by Pseudomonas sp. No. 2663. Transcriptional analysis revealed a cultivation condition in which a regulatory gene of the cryptic gene cluster is adequately expressed. Consequently, three new compounds, named thailanstatins A (1), B (2), and C (3), were isolated from the fermentation broth of B. thailandensis MSMB43. Thailanstatins are proposed to be biosynthesized by a hybrid polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase pathway. They differ from 4 by lacking an unstable hydroxyl group and by having an extra carboxyl moiety; those differences endow thailanstatins with a significantly greater stability than 4 as tested in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. In vitro assays showed that thailanstatins inhibit pre-mRNA splicing as potently as 4, with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations in the single to sub-μM range. Cell culture assays indicated that thailanstatins also possess potent antiproliferative activities in representative human cancer cell lines, with half-maximal growth inhibitory concentrations in the single nM range. This work provides new chemical entities for research and development and new structure-activity information for chemical optimization of related spliceosome inhibitors.

26948426|t|Cyanobacteria biennal dynamic in a volcanic mesotrophic lake in central Italy: Strategies to prevent dangerous human exposures to cyanotoxins.
26948426|a|Vico Lake, a volcanic meso-eutrophic lake in Central Italy, whose water is used for drinking and recreational activities, experienced the presence of the microcystins (MC) producing cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens. In order to assess the human health risks and to provide the local health authorities with a scientific basis for planning tailored monitoring activities, we studied P. rubescens ecology and toxicity for two years. P. rubescens generally dominated the phytoplankton community, alternating with Limnothrix redekei, potentially toxic. P. rubescens was distributed throughout the water column during winter; in summer it produced intense blooms where drinking water is collected (-20 m); here MC were detected all year round (0.5-5 μg/L), with implications for drinking water quality. In surface waters, MC posed no risk for recreational activities in summer, while in winter surface blooms and foams (containing up to 56 μg MC/L) can represent a risk for people and children practicing water sports and for animals consuming raw water. Total phosphorus, phosphate and inorganic nitrogen were not relevant to predict densities nor toxicity; however, a strong correlation between P. rubescens density and aminopeptidase ectoenzymatic activity, an enzyme involved in protein degradation, suggested a role of organic nitrogen for this species. The fraction of potentially toxic population, determined both as mcyB(+)/16SrDNA (10-100%) and as the MC/mcyB(+) cells (0.03-0.79 pg MC/cell), was much more variable than usually observed for P. rubescens. Differently from other Italian and European lakes, the correlation between cell density or the mcyB(+) cells and MC explained only ∼50 and 30% of MC variability, respectively: for Vico Lake, monitoring only cell or the mcyB(+) cell density is not sufficient to predict MC concentrations, and consequently to protect population health. Finally, during a winter bloom one site has been sampled weekly, showing that monthly sampling during such a phase could greatly underestimate the 'hazard'. Our results highlight the need to adopt a stepwise monitoring activity, considering the lake and the cyanobacteria specific features.

15083656|t|Ocean pollution from land-based sources: East China Sea, China.
15083656|a|The environment of East China Sea (ECS) has been faced by huge stresses from anthropogenic activities and population growth in the Yangtze River drainage basin and the areas along the coasts. Improper use of natural resources and short-term economic objectives have resulted in severe environmental degradation in a fairly short time frame and the degradation has now reached a level where the health and well being of the coastal populations are threatened. The main pollutants are inorganic nitrogen, phosphate, oil hydrocarbons, organic matters and heavy metals. Nutrients cause eutrophication of the coastal waters and the estuarine area and very often stimulate the occurrence of red tides. The environmental pollution of Yangtze River basin directly impact on the state of the marine environment in the ECS. The ecosystem stability is maintained by a steady water discharge from the river, that mixes with the marine salty water in the estuary, and the sediment loads from the river that balance ocean erosion in the delta and its adjacent coastal area. The large-scale water transfer and dam constructions in the Yangtze River basin will change this basis. For the ECS the challenge is to reverse the negative processes taking place and to restore ecosystem balance. The main challenge is to integrate socioeconomic and environmental decision making in order to promote sustainable development. A better understanding of the driving forces in society that cause these environmental pressures is required in order to overcome these obstacles. International cooperation may be an important contributor to the progress and in particular provide access to financial, technological, scientific and human resource assistance.

12568723|t|Functional analysis of the KCS-like element of the interferon-inducible RNA-specific adenosine deaminase ADAR1 promoter.
12568723|a|The ADAR1 gene encodes an RNA-specific adenosine deaminase that alters the functional activity of both viral and cellular RNAs by posttranscriptional adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing. The interferon (IFN) responsive PI promoter of the ADAR1 gene possesses an IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) responsible for IFN-inducibility, as well as an adjacent upstream sequence, designated kinase conserved sequence-like (KCS-l) element. The KCS-l element is similar to the 15-bp KCS element so far unique to the human and mouse RNA-dependent PKR kinase gene promoters. The KCS element of the PKR kinase (PKR) promoter is essential for both basal and IFN-inducible PKR promoter activity. We have now examined the functional properties of the KCS-l element of the ADAR1 PI promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) detected constitutively expressed nuclear proteins that bound selectively to the ADAR1 KCS-l element. Competition EMSA and antibody supershift assays indicated that ADAR1 KCS-l-binding proteins shared some properties with PKR KCS-binding proteins. However, transient transfection analyses performed with ADAR1 PI promoter constructs possessing deletion and substitution mutant forms of the KCS-l element revealed that the ADAR1 KCS-l element was not essential for either basal or IFN-inducible promoter activity. Substitution of the ADAR1 KCS-l element with the PKR KCS element increased both basal and inducible ADAR1 PI promoter activity. These results suggest that the KCS-l element of the ADAR1 PI promoter is not functionally equivalent to the KCS element of the PKR promoter.

1995331|t|Closely related isozymes of alcohol dehydrogenase. Carboxymethylation: gamma 1 gamma 1 differs widely from both beta 1 beta 1 and its equine equivalence EE.
1995331|a|Human gamma 1 gamma 1 alcohol dehydrogenase is quite insensitive to inactivation by iodoacetate, its equine counterpart EE highly sensitive, and the human beta 1 beta 1 form intermediately sensitive. Imidazole hardly influences the iodoacetate inactivation of gamma 1 gamma 1, enhances that of EE and decreases that of beta 1 beta 1. In all isozymes, metal-binding Cys residues are the most reactive, but the patterns for those binding the active site zinc atom differ. In phosphate, Cys-46 is most sensitive in EE and gamma 1 gamma 1, Cys-174 in beta 1 beta 1. This difference appears to correlate with the absence or presence, respectively, of an extra methyl group in the side-chain at position 48 (Ser in EE and gamma 1 gamma 1, Thr in beta 1 beta 1). In imidazole, the reactivity in beta 1 beta 1 is shifted to Cys-46, while the specificity is enhanced in EE and decreased in gamma 1 gamma 1. Thus, the inactivations illustrate large differences among structures closely related.

25959076|t|Kinetic Evaluation of Determinant Factors for Cellular Accumulation of Protoporphyrin IX Induced by External 5-Aminolevulinic Acid for Photodynamic Cancer Therapy.
25959076|a|Five-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is a prodrug to generate phototoxic protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) for photodynamic cancer therapy. It remains unclear how PPIX accumulates in cancer cells; therefore, we aimed to clarify determinant factors by assessing ALA uptake, PPIX biosynthesis, conversion of PPIX to heme (ferrochelatase activity), and PPIX efflux, independently, in 10 human cancer cell lines. ALA-induced PPIX accumulation was not correlated with ALA uptake clearance. ALA uptake rates were far greater than maximum conversion rates of ALA to PPIX in the five cell lines, where ALA uptake activity was detected. A negative correlation of PPIX accumulation with ferrochelatase activity was found, but not statistically significant among all cell lines. As PPIX accumulation was restored in MCF-7 and DU145 cells by adding an inhibitor of PPIX efflux transporter BCRP, a compartment model incorporating PPIX synthesis, ferrochelatase activity, and PPIX efflux, was established, and hybrid parameters (π index) calculated using the model were significantly correlated with ALA-induced PPIX accumulation (r = 0.90, p = 0.005). Accordingly, kinetic analyses indicate that ALA-induced PPIX levels are determined by the three processes of PPIX biosynthesis, conversion of PPIX to heme, and PPIX efflux, suggesting that π index is a useful to predict ALA-induced PPIX accumulation.

15055471|t|Circulating nitric oxide is modulated by recombinant human TSH administration during monitoring of thyroid cancer remnant.
15055471|a|During the administration of recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) to monitor differentiated thyroid carcinoma, mild side effects, such as nausea and headaches, often occur. The origin of these is not clear. Since changes in TSH and thyroid hormones can modulate some endothelial-derived factors, we aimed at testing whether rhTSH administration induces changes in nitric oxide. We studied 25 patients (56.6+/-12.6 yr) who had undergone thyroidectomy followed by ablative radioiodine for papillary thyroid cancer and who were under follow-up. While L-thyroxine therapy continued, thyroglobulin (Tg), TSH, free-T3, free-T4 and nitrite-plus-nitrate (NOx) concentrations were evaluated before and after rhTSH administration (0.9 mg i.m. on 2 consecutive days). Mean TSH showed a huge increase from baseline (0.1+/-0.0 mIU/l) to day 3 (216.3+/-17.5 mIU/l, p<0.001), which was not accompanied by changes in thyroid hormones. Mean baseline NOx levels were 12.6+/-1.2 micromoles/l and showed a significant increase on day 3 (20.1+/-1.2 micromoles/l, p<0.05 vs day 0), followed by progressive reduction from day 6 (18.1+/-2.8 micromoles/l) to day 9 (10.6+/-1.3 micromoles/l, p<0.05 vs day 0). There was a significant (p=0.04) correlation between the percentage increase in TSH and the percentage increase in NOx. On the other hand, increase in TSH did not correlate with the percentage decrease in NOx from day 6 to day 9. No correlation was noted between the increase in TSH or NOx and the occurrence or severity of the symptoms. Our study shows that, during rhTSH testing, circulating nitric oxide increases. This endothelial-derived factor might, in turn, mediate the occurrence of vasomotor headache and nausea in some particularly susceptible patients.

18083522|t|N(delta)-Methylated L-arginine derivatives and their effects on the nitric oxide generating system.
18083522|a|So far N(delta)-methyl-l-arginine (MA) is only detected in yeast cells. Assuming that MA also exists in mammalians we examined possible physiological effects of N(delta)-methylated l-arginine derivatives on the nitric oxide generating system, that is, nitric oxide synthase (NOS), arginase and dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH). N(delta)-methyl-l-citrulline (MC) turned out to be a weak non-specific inhibitor of nitric oxide synthases. Moreover, MA is hydroxylated by all human NOS isoforms to N(omega)-hydroxy-N(delta)-methyl-l-arginine (NHAM) but not converted further. This hydroxylated intermediate, however, was detected to be a potent inhibitor of bovine liver arginase with a K(i) of 17.1+/-2.2 microM.

15141835|t|Nitric oxide inhibition after Toxoplasma gondii infection of chicken macrophage cell lines.
15141835|a|Toxoplasma gondii infects many warm-blooded animals, including chickens. However, little is known about how this protozoan behaves within chicken macrophages. Thus, the microbicidal biology of HD11 and MQ-NCSU (available chicken macrophage cell lines) and the escaping mechanism of T. gondii were investigated. After infection, both cell lines were activated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and nitric oxide (NO), and reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) were evaluated. T. gondii infected both cell lines, and 30 and 60% inhibition of NO production was detected in MQ-NCSU and HD11, respectively. In HD11, NO inhibition was not dependent on cyclooxygenase products. Although NO was partially inhibited, it did control T. gondii multiplication, showing the importance of this microbicidal molecule. Production of ROI was not detected in either cell line after T. gondii or yeast interaction. NADPH diaphorase (NADPH-d) activity, a histochemical marker of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), was detected at various levels in the HD11 population activated with LPS. The HD11 population infected with T. gondii showed a decrease in NADPH-d, indicating that NO production inhibition was related to iNOS disappearance in infected macrophages. These results demonstrate that in chicken macrophages T. gondii can also inhibit NO production, which suggests that an iNOS suppression mechanism might be used for better survival in macrophages.

2160469|t|A synthetic presequence reversibly inhibits protein import into yeast mitochondria.
2160469|a|We show that a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 22 residues of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV presequence blocked import of pre-subunit IV into yeast mitochondria. The 22-residue peptide pL4-(1-22) did not alter the electrical potential across the mitochondrial inner membrane (the delta psi). Inhibition of import was reversible and could be overcome by the addition of increased amounts of precursor. Two other peptides, pL4-(1-16) and pL4-(1-23), which correspond to, respectively, the N-terminal 16 and 23 residues of the same presequence, also blocked import of pre-subunit IV. However, pL4-(1-16) was a much weaker inhibitor of import, while the inhibitory effect of pL4-(1-23) was due to its ability to completely collapse the delta psi. pL4-(1-22) seems to be a general inhibitor of mitochondrial import, in that it also blocked uptake of several other proteins. These included the precursors of the yeast proteins cytochrome c oxidase subunit Va, the F1-ATPase beta subunit, mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase, and the ATP/ADP carrier. In addition, uptake of two non-yeast precursor proteins (human ornithine transcarbamylase and a cytochrome oxidase subunit IV-dihydrofolate reductase fusion), was also blocked by the peptide. Subsequent studies revealed that pL4-(1-22) did not block the initial recognition or binding of proteins to mitochondria. Rather, our results suggest that the peptide acts at a subsequent translocation step which is common to the import pathways of many different precursor proteins.

2981928|t|Impaired oxidative burst does not affect human monocyte tumoricidal activity.
2981928|a|Human peripheral blood monocytes have been shown to lyse neoplastic cells selectively. It has been suggested that the oxidative burst may mediate monocyte tumoricidal activity. Two patients with chronic granulomatous disease were studied. The first patient had no detectable secretion of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion after stimulation with 100 ng/ml PMA. Nevertheless, his tumoricidal activity measured against K562 targets in 4-hr 51Cr-release assays by using highly purified monocytes was reproducibly above the 95th percentile of the normal population. His monocytes lysed WEHI-164 targets pretreated with 1 microgram/ml Actinomycin D with similar efficiency. Another patient whose oxidative burst was 15% of normal nevertheless killed Daudi targets efficiently. In addition, oxygen-deprived monocytes of normal donors manifested normal tumoricidal activity, despite failure to produce any detectable oxidative burst after PMA stimulation. We conclude that reactive oxygen metabolites are not the primary mediators of tumor cytolysis by human peripheral blood monocytes.

12967937|t|Mechanisms of anion secretion in Calu-3 human airway epithelial cells by 7,8-benzoquinoline.
12967937|a|(1) Cultured epithelial monolayers of Calu-3 human airway cells were used to measure anion secretion in response to a number of phenanthrolines and benzoquinolines, using short-circuit current measurements. Calu-3 cells are derived from serous cells of submucosal glands of the airways and are a target for conditions in which muco-ciliary clearance is compromised. (2) Compounds studied were 5,6-benzoquinoline, 5-chloro-1,10-phenanthroline, 7,8-benzoquinoline, 5-nitro-1,10-phenanthroline, benzo[c]cinnoline and 1,10-phenanthroline, which gave EC50 values of 34, 48, 123, 235, 192 and 217 microm, respectively. Of these, 7,8-benzoquinoline was chosen for further detailed study. Concentration-response relationships for all the compounds had Hill slopes greater than 1. (3) Permeabilisation of the apical surface of epithelia with nystatin in the presence of an apical to basolateral potassium ion gradient reduced the EC50 for 7,8-benzoquinoline to 31 microm and altered the Hill slope to close to 1. (4) Using apically permeabilised epithelia it was shown that 7,8-benzoquinoline activates an intermediate-conductance calcium-sensitive potassium channel (KCNN4) and a cAMP-sensitive potassium channel (KCNQ1/KCNE3) in the basolateral epithelial membranes. (5) 7,8-Benzoquinoline was shown to increase chloride conductance of apical epithelial membranes, presumed to be by activation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. (6) 7,8-Benzoquinoline had a minor effect on cAMP accumulation in Calu-3 cells, probably by inhibition of phosphodiesterase, which may contribute to its effect on CFTR- and cAMP-sensitive potassium channels. (7) The usefulness of these novel actions in promoting secretion in airway submucosal glands is discussed.

17985234|t|Dex-ras1 and serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible protein kinase 1: regulation of expression by dexamethasone in HEK293 cells.
17985234|a|The molecular and cellular basis of the psychotropic actions of adrenal corticosteroids is poorly understood. Previously, we reported that modulation of large conductance Ca2+-activated potassium channel (BK-channel) function by glucocorticoids can be recapitulated in human embryonic kidney293 (HEK293) cells (J Physiol 537:57, 2001). In the present paper, we examined the effect of dexamethasone on the expression of candidate mediator proteins of glucocorticoid action, dex-ras1 and serum and glucocorticoid inducible protein kinase 1 (SGK), in HEK293 cells. Dex-ras1 mRNA was readily detectable under basal conditions however, no changes of dex-ras1 mRNA expression occurred upon exposure to 100 nM of dexamethasone for 2 h. In contrast, a 2.5-fold increase of SGK mRNA was found under similar conditions. Total levels of cellular SGK protein were unaltered upon exposure to dexamethasone, but a marked increase of SGK in a Triton-X100 insoluble fraction was observed. BK-channel alpha-subunits could not be co-immunoprecipitated with SGK. In summary, SGK, but not dex-ras1, mRNA is rapidly induced by glucocorticoid stimulation in HEK293 cells. However, there appears to be no direct protein-protein interaction between SGK and BK-channel alpha-subunits.

26091567|t|The mitochondrial phosphate carrier: Role in oxidative metabolism, calcium handling and mitochondrial disease.
26091567|a|The mitochondrial phosphate carrier (PiC) is a mitochondrial solute carrier protein, which is encoded by SLC25A3 in humans. PiC delivers phosphate, a key substrate of oxidative phosphorylation, across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This transport activity is also relevant for allowing effective mitochondrial calcium handling. Furthermore, PiC has also been described to affect cell survival mechanisms via interactions with cyclophilin D and the viral mitochondrial-localized inhibitor of apoptosis (vMIA). The significance of PiC has been supported by the recent discovery of a fatal human condition associated with PiC mutations. Here, we present first the early studies that lead to the discovery and molecular characterization of the PiC, then discuss the very recently developed mouse models for PiC and pathological mutations in the human SLC25A3 gene.

8938715|t|Potassium currents expressed from Drosophila and mouse eag cDNAs in Xenopus oocytes.
8938715|a|The ether-a-go-go (eag) gene family encodes a set of related ion channel polypeptides expressed in the excitable cells of organisms ranging from invertebrates to mammals. Earlier studies demonstrated that eag mutations in Drosophila cause an increase in membrane excitability in the nervous system. Mutations in the human eag-related gene (HERG) have been implicated in cardiac arrhythmia, and recent studies show that HERG subunits contribute to the channels mediating IKr and the terminal repolarization of the cardiac action potential. A physiological role for M-EAG, the mouse counterpart to Drosophila eag, has not been determined. Here, we describe basic properties of Eag and M-EAG channels expressed in frog oocytes, using two-electrode voltage clamp and patch clamp techniques. Both Eag and M-EAG channels are voltage-dependent, outwardly rectifying and highly selective for K+ over Na+ over Na+ ions. In contrast to previous reports, we found no evidence for Ca2+ flux through Eag channels. The most notable difference between these closely related channels is that Eag currents exhibit partial inactivation, whereas M-EAG currents are sustained for the duration of an activating voltage command. In addition, Eag currents run down more rapidly than do M-EAG currents in excised macropatches. Rundown is reversible by inserting the patch into the interior of the oocyte, indicating that a cytosolic factor regulates channel activity or stability. These studies should facilitate identification of currents mediated by Eag and M-EAG channels in vivo.

26542709|t|Improved electroporation procedure for genetic transformation of Dekkera/Brettanomyces bruxellensis.
26542709|a|Yeast Dekkera/Brettanomyces bruxellensis is one of the most common contaminants in wine industry, but also one of the most promising candidates for large-scale bioethanol production. Brettanomyces bruxellensis not only produces and tolerates high ethanol concentrations, but can also ferment cellobiose and adapt to lignocellulose hydrolasate. Furthermore, genome sequences of several B. bruxellensis strains are available, and efforts have been made to develop tools for genetic transformation of this yeast. Previously, we reported a successful transformation using lithium acetate/PEG method and electroporation, however, with very low transformation efficiency (10-20 transformants μg(-1)). Here we describe an optimization of electroporation procedure which resulted in a significant increase of transformation efficiency (2.8 × 10(3) transformants μg(-1)). Several key transformation parameters were optimized including cell growth phase, density of cells in the transformation sample and electroporation settings. We determined that treating the cells with both lithium acetate (100 mM) and dithiothreitol (35 mM) synergistically improves transformation efficiency. Using the described procedure around 500 transformants can be obtained per transformation sample with 180 ng of non-homologous linear transforming fragment. Additionally, several transformants were obtained with less than 1 ng of DNA demonstrating that this procedure is adequate even when very limited amount of DNA is available.

15381763|t|Sword and shield: linked group B streptococcal beta-hemolysin/cytolysin and carotenoid pigment function to subvert host phagocyte defense.
15381763|a|Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a major cause of pneumonia, bacteremia, and meningitis in neonates and has been found to persist inside host phagocytic cells. The pore-forming GBS beta-hemolysin/cytolysin (betaH/C) encoded by cylE is an important virulence factor as demonstrated in several in vivo models. Interestingly, cylE deletion results not only in the loss of betaH/C activity, but also in the loss of a carotenoid pigment of unknown function. In this study, we sought to define the mechanism(s) by which cylE may contribute to GBS phagocyte resistance and increased virulence potential. We found that cylE-deficient GBS was more readily cleared from a mouse's bloodstream, human whole blood, and isolated macrophage and neutrophil cultures. Survival was linked to the ability of betaH/C to induce cytolysis and apoptosis of the phagocytes. At a lower bacterial inoculum, cylE also contributed to enhanced survival within phagocytes that was attributed to the ability of carotenoid to shield GBS from oxidative damage. In oxidant killing assays, cylE mutants were shown to be more susceptible to hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorite, superoxide, and singlet oxygen. Together, these data suggest a mechanism by which the linked cylE-encoded phenotypes, betaH/C (sword) and carotenoid (shield), act in partnership to thwart the immune phagocytic defenses.

22721584|t|Role of intramyocelluar lipids in human health.
22721584|a|Intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) is predominantly stored as intramuscular triglyceride (IMTG) in lipid droplets and is utilized as metabolic fuel during physical exercise. IMTG is also implicated in muscle insulin resistance (IR) in type 2 diabetes. However, it has become apparent that lipid moieties such as ceramide and diacylglycerol are the likely culprits of IR. This article reviews current knowledge of IMCL-mediated IR and important areas of investigation, including myocellular lipid transport and lipid droplet proteins. Several crucial questions remain unanswered, such as the identity of specific ceramide and diacylglycerol species that mediate IR in human muscle and their subcellular location. Quantitative lipidomics and proteomics of targeted subcellular organelles will help to better define the mechanisms underlying pathological IMCL accumulation and IR.

28131071|t|Early drug use of dapagliflozin prescribed by general practitioners and diabetologists in Germany.
28131071|a|OBJECTIVES: Dapagliflozin is an inhibitor of the human sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) that has been shown to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics and treatment patterns of dapagliflozin users in comparison to users of other anti-diabetic (AD) treatments in Germany. METHODS: Data from patients with T2DM initiating at least one prescription for dapagliflozin or other AD therapy between November 2012 and April 2014 were collected from the IMS German Disease Analyzer database. RESULTS: The use of dapagliflozin combination therapy (n=1034; 74%) was more common than monotherapy (n=371; 26%). In comparison with other AD therapy users, a higher percentage of dapagliflozin users were ⩽64years of age (62.3% vs. 36.4%), and a higher proportion were male (59.1% vs. 53.6%). The average duration of diabetes was comparable between dapagliflozin patients and other AD therapy users (5.7yearsvs. 5.5years), however higher levels of HbA1c were found in dapagliflozin users (8.2% (66mmol/mol) vs. 7.5% (58mmol/mol). For the vast majority (71.5% of 10mg dapagliflozin users and 88.9% of 5mg users), dapagliflozin was prescribed in combination with other AD therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Patients starting on dapagliflozin differed in several demographic and health-related respects to patients starting another AD therapy during the same period. Dapagliflozin was predominantly used as a component of combination therapy, adding on to existing therapy. After initiation, switching to other AD treatments or adding to therapy was comparatively rare during the first year.

10969303|t|Intracarotid infusion of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, L-NMMA, modestly decreases cerebral blood flow in human subjects.
10969303|a|BACKGROUND: The authors hypothesized that if nitric oxide (NO) was a determinant of background cerebrovascular tone, intracarotid infusion of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), a NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor, would decrease cerebral blood flow (CBF) and intracarotid L-arginine would reverse its effect. METHODS: In angiographically normal cerebral hemispheres, after the initial dose-escalation studies (protocol 1), the authors determined the effect of intracarotid L-NMMA (50 mg/min for 5 min) on CBF and mean arterial pressure (MAP) over time (protocol 2). Changes in CBF and MAP were then determined at baseline, during L-NMMA infusion, and after L-NMMA during L-arginine infusion (protocol 3). To investigate effects of higher arterial blood concentrations of L-NMMA, changes in CBF and MAP were assessed at baseline and after a bolus dose of L-NMMA (250 mg/1 min), and vascular reactivity was tested by intracarotid verapamil (1 mg/min, protocol 4). CBF changes were also assessed during induced hypertension with intravenous phenylephrine (protocol 5). RESULTS: Infusion of L-NMMA (50 mg/min for 5 min, n = 7, protocol 2) increased MAP by 17% (86 +/- 8 to 100 +/- 11 mmHg; P < 0.0001) and decreased CBF by 20% (45 +/- 8 to 36 +/- 6 ml. 100 g-1. min-1; P < 0.005) for 10 min. Intracarotid l-arginine infusion after L-NMMA (protocol 3) reversed the effect of L-NMMA. Bolus L-NMMA (protocol 4) increased MAP by 20% (80 +/- 11 to 96+/-13 mmHg; P< 0.005), but there was no significant decrease in CBF. Intracarotid verapamil increased CBF by 41% (44+/- 8 to 62 +/- 9 ml. 100 g-1. min-1; P< 0.005). Phenylephrine-induced hypertension increased MAP by 20% (79 +/- 9 to 95 +/- 6 mmHg; P = 0.001) but did not affect CBF. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that intracarotid L-NMMA modestly decreases CBF, and the background tone of cerebral resistance vessels may be relatively insensitive to NOS inhibition by the intraarterial route.

7169496|t|Butyrate-induced histone hyperacetylation in human and mouse cells: estimation of putative sites of histone acetylation in vivo.
7169496|a|Human and mouse cells in culture were treated with various concentrations of sodium butyrate. Acid-extracted histones of control and butyrate-treated cells were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. All core histones of the control cells contained modified forms. All core histones of the butyrate-treated cells were hyperacetylated. Depending on the number of acetylation sites per molecule, each histone or histone variant exhibited a characteristic number of acetylated forms. This number was the same for each histone common in human and mouse cells treated with butyrate. Histones 2A.1, 2A.2, and 2A.X have two sites of inner acetylation; 2A.Z has 3; 2B's have 5; and each one of the H3 variants as well as H4 have 4.

12238564|t|Dexamethasone inhibits apoptosis of human neutrophils induced by reactive oxygen species.
12238564|a|Neutrophils are completely differentiated cells that die in tissues a few days after they migrate from the vascular compartment as a consequence of a rigouous apoptotic program. Many of the mediators produced during an inflammatory response delay neutrophil apoptosis allowing a more efficient removal of microorganisms but also favoring the tissue damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lysosomal proteins released by neutrophils. Glucocorticoids delay the apoptosis of neutrophils but the mechanisms are not completely understood. To investigate the inhibition of glucocorticoids on neutrophil apoptosis we have used the glucose/glucose oxidase (G/GO) system as a constant source of hydrogen peroxide. When neutrophils are incubated in the presence of the G/GO system, a significant acceleration of their apoptotic response is observed. Preincubation with 10(-6) M, 10(-7) M, 10(-8) M or 10(-9) M of dexamethasone, negatively modulated the spontaneous and G/GO induced apoptosis of neutrophils. Then the G/GO system is a useful model to simulate the oxidative stress of neutrophils, and that the effect of DXM on neutrophil apoptosis depends, at least in part, on blocking the proapoptotic effect of ROS.

3105618|t|Immunoradiometric quantitation of tissue plasminogen activator-related antigen in human plasma: crypticity phenomenon and relationship to plasma fibrinolysis.
3105618|a|A two-site immunoradiometric assay for tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) antigen has been developed using immunoaffinity purified antibody. Various treatments enhanced the detection of tPA antigen in the plasma samples. Maximum detection was obtained by acidification of plasma to pH 4.8 to 6.5 or addition of 0.5 mol/L of L-lysine or L-arginine. Acidification or addition of lysine to plasma is also required for maximum immunoadsorption of plasma tPA antigen on anti-tPA-Ig-sepharose. These results indicate that plasma tPA antigen is partially cryptic to antibody in untreated plasma. The plasma tPA antigen isolated by immunoadsorption of either untreated plasma or acidified plasma on anti-tPA-Ig-sepharose consists mainly of a 100-kd plasminogen activator species as determined by fibrin-agar zymography. The 100-kd activity is possibly a tPA:inhibitor complex. A standardized sample preparation method was conveniently adopted by mixing 3 vol of plasma and 1 vol of 2 mol/L of L-lysine for the assay. Reconstitution and recovery studies showed that the method is specific and permits full detection of both free tPA and tPA:inhibitor complex. The validity of the assay is further supported by the finding that the spontaneous plasma fibrinolysis previously demonstrated to be dependent on plasma tPA antigen is correlated with tPA antigen content. Using the standardized assay, we found that tPA antigen concentrations in 16 blood bank plasmas are equivalent to 3.7 to 20 ng of 60 kd tPA/mL. In all the plasma tested, more than half of the antigen is undetected unless the plasma is treated as described above.

3463438|t|Host cell reactivation by human cells of DNA expression vectors damaged by ultraviolet radiation or by acid-heat treatment.
3463438|a|We utilized a plasmid vector host cell reactivation assay to probe the biological functioning of DNA expression vectors and their encoded genes. We studied the effect of ultraviolet radiation or acid-heat treatment on the transient expression of genes transfected into normal human cells and into DNA repair deficient (xeroderma pigmentosum) cells and modification of gene expression by sodium butyrate. U.v. inactivation of transient expression of the bacterial gpt gene contained in a non-replicating expression vector plasmid, pSV2catSVgpt, was much greater in three xeroderma pigmentosum lines than in the four other human cell lines tested. In contrast, treatment of pSV2catSVgpt with acid and heat to produce apurinic sites resulted in a similar slope of the inactivation curve of the bacterial cat gene in the repair deficient and repair proficient cells. Thus, u.v. damage of DNA expression vectors was subject to repair by the normal host cells, but acid-heat treatment resulted in damage (apurinic sites) that was handled in a similar manner by excision repair deficient and excision repair proficient human cells. In both normal and xeroderma pigmentosum cells sodium butyrate treatment of cells resulted in a greater stimulation of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression with u.v. damaged than with undamaged plasmid. This assay thus permits examination of the effects of defined types of DNA damage on plasmid expression and study of its modulation by cellular repair activities.

17592118|t|Measurement of 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine metabolism in MCF-7 cells at low concentrations using accelerator mass spectrometry.
17592118|a|Growing evidence suggests that oxidative damage to cells generates mutagenic 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), which may initiate diseases related to aging and carcinogenesis. Kinetic measurement of 8-oxodG metabolism and repair in cells has been hampered by poor assay sensitivity and by difficulty characterizing the flux of oxidized nucleotides through the relevant metabolic pathways. We report here the development of a sensitive and quantitative approach to characterizing the kinetics and metabolic sources of 8-oxodG in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells by accelerator mass spectrometry. We observed that [(14)C]8-oxodG at medium concentrations of up to 2 pmol/ml was taken up by MCF-7 cells, phosphorylated to mono-, di-, and triphosphate derivatives, and incorporated into DNA. Oxidative stress caused by exposure of the cells to 17beta-estradiol resulted in a reduction in the rate of [(14)C]8-oxodG incorporation into DNA and an increase in the ratio of 8-oxodG monophosphate (8-oxodGMP) to 8-oxodG triphosphate (8-oxodGTP) in the nucleotide pool. 17beta-Estradiol-induced oxidative stress up-regulated the nucleotide pool cleansing enzyme MTH1 and possibly other Nudix-related pyrophosphohydrolases. These data support the conclusion that 8-oxodGTP is formed in the nucleotide pool by both 8-oxodG metabolism and endogenous reactive oxygen species. The metabolism of 8-oxodG to 8-oxodGTP, followed by incorporation into DNA is a mechanism by which the cellular presence of this oxidized nucleoside can lead to mutations.

19805063|t|Voltage-gated proton channels maintain pH in human neutrophils during phagocytosis.
19805063|a|Phagocytosis of microbial invaders represents a fundamental defense mechanism of the innate immune system. The subsequent killing of microbes is initiated by the respiratory burst, in which nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase generates vast amounts of superoxide anion, precursor to bactericidal reactive oxygen species. Cytoplasmic pH regulation is crucial because NADPH oxidase functions optimally at neutral pH, yet produces enormous quantities of protons. We monitored pH(i) in individual human neutrophils during phagocytosis of opsonized zymosan, using confocal imaging of the pH sensing dye SNARF-1, enhanced by shifted excitation and emission ratioing, or SEER. Despite long-standing dogma that Na(+)/H(+) antiport regulates pH during the phagocyte respiratory burst, we show here that voltage-gated proton channels are the first transporter to respond. During the initial phagocytotic event, pH(i) decreased sharply, and recovery required both Na(+)/H(+) antiport and proton current. Inhibiting myeloperoxidase attenuated the acidification, suggesting that diffusion of HOCl into the cytosol comprises a substantial acid load. Inhibiting proton channels with Zn(2+) resulted in profound acidification to levels that inhibit NADPH oxidase. The pH changes accompanying phagocytosis in bone marrow phagocytes from HVCN1-deficient mice mirrored those in control mouse cells treated with Zn(2+). Both the rate and extent of acidification in HVCN1-deficient cells were twice larger than in control cells. In summary, acid extrusion by proton channels is essential to the production of reactive oxygen species during phagocytosis.

7867086|t|Different subcellular localization of cytochrome b and the dormant NADPH-oxidase in neutrophils and macrophages: effect on the production of reactive oxygen species during phagocytosis.
7867086|a|When neutrophils and macrophages phagocytose a prey, e.g., complement (C3b)-opsonized yeast particles, the oxygen radical generating NADPH-oxidase is activated. In neutrophils, most of the production of oxygen metabolites occurred in an intracellular compartment, possibly in the phagolysosome. In contrast, no intracellular production could be detected in human macrophages. In these cells, the subcellular localization of the superoxide-generating NADPH-oxidase and associated cytochrome b was assessed in intact cells with indirect immunofluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy, and with subcellular fractionation, using centrifugation on Percoll density gradients. A dual localization of the cytochrome b as well as the dormant NADPH-oxidase activity in neutrophils was in agreement with earlier immunocytochemical, biochemical, and subcellular fractionation studies. Furthermore, most of the activity was recovered from the specific granules, whereas only a small fraction was retained in the plasma membrane. In contrast, the cytochrome b/NADPH-oxidase activity in macrophages localized primarily in the plasma membrane fraction. We suggest that the macrophages are incapable of producing reactive oxygen species intraphagosomally, due to an absence of a granule-localized pool of the membrane components of the NADPH-oxidase.

1910812|t|Differential expression of hsp70 stress proteins in human endothelial cells exposed to heat shock and hydrogen peroxide.
1910812|a|The potential role of oxidative stress conditions in the induction of heat shock proteins was studied in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. We compared the effects of temperature (43 to 45 degrees C), exposure to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and oxygen metabolites generated by the enzyme system hypoxanthine-xanthine oxidase (O2- plus H2O2), as well as exposure to 95% O2, on the expression of the major 70-kD heat shock proteins (hsp70). Northern blot analysis indicated that: (1) heat shock induced a rapid and marked increase in hsp70 mRNA levels that reached a maximum during recovery from a 30-min exposure to 45 degrees C; (2) treatment with a 5-mM H2O2 bolus or 50 mU/ml xanthine oxidase also increased hsp70 mRNA levels but to a lesser extent than heat shock (about 10 and 25 times less, respectively); (3) no change was detected after a 5-day exposure to 95% O2. Nuclear run on transcription data and kinetics of mRNA decay in the presence of actinomycin D indicated that the observed increase in hsp70 mRNA levels in both heat-shocked and H2O2-treated cells was mainly due to a transcriptional induction. The kinetics of hsp70 synthesis correlated with the accumulation of hsp70 mRNA. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunologic analysis of these heat shock proteins revealed a series of at least five distinct hsp70 isoforms induced in heat-shocked cells, whereas only a specific subset of these proteins, mainly one acidic isoform, was induced in very low amounts in response to H2O2 treatment. These results clearly indicate that the endothelial cell responses to oxidative stress and heat shock differ in both qualitative and quantitative terms in respect to hsp70 induction. They also suggest that the intensity of this response to oxidative stress conditions may vary depending on the nature of the oxidative challenge.

6810003|t|Repair of chromosome damage induced by X-irradiation during G2 phase in a line of normal human fibroblasts and its malignant derivative.
6810003|a|A line of normal human skin fibroblasts (KD) differed from its malignant derivative (HUT-14) in the extent of cytogenetic damage induced by X-irradiation during G2 phase. Malignant cells had significantly more chromatid breaks and gaps after exposure to 25, 50, or 100 rad. On the assumption that each chromatid contains a single continuous DNA double helix, chromatid breaks would represent unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks; the gaps may represent single-strand breaks. Results from alkaline elution of cellular DNA immediately after irradiation showed that the normal and malignant cells in asynchronous population were equally sensitive to DNA single-strand breakage by X-irradiation. Caffeine or beta-cytosine arabinoside (ara-C), inhibitors of DNA repair, when added directly following G2 phase exposure, significantly increased the incidence of radiation-induced chromatid damage in the normal cells. In contrast, similar treatment of the malignant cells had little influence. Ara-C differed from caffeine in its effects; whereas both agents increased the frequency of chromatid breaks and gaps, only ara-C increased the frequency of gaps to the level observed in the irradiated malignant cells. Addition of catalase, which destroys H2O2, or mannitol, a scavenger of the derivative free hydroxyl radical (.OH), to the cultures of malignant cells before, during, and following irradiation significantly reduced the chromatid damage; and catalase prevented formation of chromatid gaps. The DNA damage induced by X-ray during G2 phase in the normal KD cells was apparently repaired by a caffeine- and ara-C-sensitive mechanism(s) that was deficient or absent in their malignant derivatives.

19602432|t|Oxidative stress of silica nanoparticles in human bronchial epithelial cell, Beas-2B.
19602432|a|In this study, the potentially harmful effect of the exposure to fumed and porous silicon dioxide (silica) nanoparticles was investigated using human bronchial epithelial cell, Beas-2B, with a focus on the involvement of oxidative stress as the toxic mechanism. Silica nanoparticles-induced oxidative stress was assessed by examining the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induction of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Subsequently, to understand the mechanism of nanoparticles-induced oxidative stress, the involvement of oxidative stress-responding transcription factors, such as, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and nuclear factor-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf-2), as well as the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signal transduction pathway were investigated. From the overall results, silica nanoparticles exerted toxicity via oxidative stress, which lead to the induction of HO-1 via the Nrf-2-ERK MAP kinase signaling pathway; cells exposed to porous silica nanoparticles showed a more sensitive response than those exposed to fumed silica. Nevertheless, the parameters tested were rather limited in terms of gaining a full understanding of the oxidative stress and cellular response due to exposure to silica nanoparticles. Further studies on the mechanism by which silica nanoparticles induce the Nrf-2-ERK MAP kinase pathway, to more clearly elucidate the silica-induced oxidative stress, as well as on the relationship between the physico-chemical properties of nanoparticles and their cytotoxicity are warranted to gain an understanding of the phenomenon of different sensitivities between porous and fumed silica.

20417210|t|Regulation of mRNAs encoding the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme in the elasmobranch interrenal gland.
20417210|a|The rate-limiting and regulated step in steroidogenesis, the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, is facilitated by the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and cytochrome P450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage (P450scc). We have isolated cDNAs encoding StAR and P450scc from the Atlantic stingray, Dasyatis sabina, and characterized the steroidogenic activity of the encoded proteins using a heterologous expression system. Green monkey kidney (COS-1) cells cotransfected with D. sabina StAR and human P450scc/adrenodoxin reductase/adrenodoxin fusion (F2) constructs produced significantly more pregnenolone than cells transfected with the F2 construct alone. COS-1 cells transfected with a modified F2 construct (F2DS) in which human P450scc is replaced by D. sabina P450scc had higher rates than cells transfected with D. sabina P450scc alone. In other vertebrates, the stress peptide adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) elicits its effects on corticosteroidogenesis in part through regulation of StAR and P450scc mRNAs. In vitro incubation of D. sabina interrenal tissue with porcine ACTH significantly increased intracellular cAMP and corticosteroid production. As demonstrated by quantitative PCR, ACTH also induced significant increases in mRNA abundance of both StAR and P450scc. Our results suggest that, as in higher vertebrates, chronic ACTH-induced glucocorticoid synthesis in elasmobranchs is mediated by regulation of primary steroidogenic mRNAs. This study is the first to demonstrate steroidogenic activity of an elasmobranch P450scc protein and express a composite elasmobranch steroidogenic pathway in a heterologous cell line. Also, the regulation of StAR and P450scc mRNAs has not previously been demonstrated in elasmobranch fishes.

CBS deficient yeast export significantly more homocysteine into the media than wild-type yeast and have elevated internal pools of homocysteine and SAH. We found that 5 mM homocysteine added to the media had very little effect on the growth of wild-type or CBS deficient yeast, although intracellular homocysteine concentrations increased five- to tenfold. In contrast, as little as 25 microM S-adenosylhomocysteine inhibited the growth of CBS deficient yeast, but had no effect on wild-type yeast. Measurements of the intracellular S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and SAH indicate that CBS deficient yeast contain reduced SAM/SAH ratios relative to wild-type, and this ratio is further reduced by adding SAH to the media. Growth inhibition by SAH in CBS deficient yeast can be totally reversed by addition of SAM to the media, indicating that the ratio and not absolute level is critical for cell growth. These results suggest that CBS plays a key role in the regulation of the SAM/SAH ratio inside cells and that excessive perturbations of this ratio can inhibit growth. We hypothesize that elevated extracellular homocysteine present in humans may reflect an altered intracellular SAM/SAH ratio and that this may be related to disease pathogenesis.

2479641|t|Lipid peroxidation changes the expression of specific epitopes of apolipoprotein A-I.
2479641|a|Incubation of human serum or high density lipoprotein (HDL) at 37 degrees C in the presence of Fe2+, Fe2+/Fe3+, or Mn2+ results in the increased immunoreactivity (up to 12-, 40-, and 80-fold, respectively) of specific apoA-I epitopes identified as 3D4 and 6B8, while Mg2+, Ca2+, or Cu2+ have minimal or nonsignificant effects. The effect of Mn2+ on the 3D4 epitope requires a specific association with lipids since it can be observed with HDL but not with apoHDL, even in the presence of other lipoproteins. The increase in immunoreactivity noted with Fe2+/Fe3+ or Mn2+ can be blocked with either EDTA or antioxidants (GSH and ascorbic acid), suggesting that it takes place during a peroxidative reaction of the lipids. The peroxidation of lipids which accompanies the increase in immunoreactivity does cross-link apoA-I both with itself and with apoA-II but does not cleave the molecule. The apoA-I-containing lipoproteins which float between 1.18 and 1.22 g/ml and have a pre B-electrophoretic migration are characterized by a very low immunoreactivity with monoclonal antibody 3D4 but are 10-fold or more responsive to Mn2+ treatment than other lipoprotein subfractions, thus demonstrating heterogeneity under oxidative conditions. Proteoliposomes containing apoA-I, cholesterol, and dilinoleyl-lecithin are sensitive to Mn2+ treatment, but not those made with dioleyl- or dimyristoyl-lecithins. However, the increase in 3D4 immunoreactivity is weak and transient and is followed by the disappearance of the epitope caused by cross-linking. We conclude that lipid peroxidation can specifically cross-link apoA-I and change its conformation and antigenicity.

12051356|t|Fatal and nonfatal poisoning by hydrogen sulfide at an industrial waste site.
12051356|a|An adult man (A) entered a pit to collect seepage at an industrial waste site in Japan. As he suddenly lost consciousness, three colleagues (B, C, D) entered the pit to rescue him. All of these men lost consciousness in the pit. Two workers (A and B) died soon after the accident, one worker (C) died 22 days after the accident, and one worker (D) survived. Since hydrogen sulfide gas was detected in the atmosphere of the pit, gas poisoning was suspected. Toxicological analyses of sulfide and thiosulfate, a metabolite of sulfide, in blood and urine of the victims were made using the extractive alkylation technique combined with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Sulfide was detected in the blood of A and B at levels of 0.13 and 0.11 mg/L, respectively, somewhat higher than in healthy persons. Thiosulfate was detected in whole blood of deceased victims A and B, in the plasma of deceased victim C, at concentrations of 10.53, 4.59, and 4.14 mg/L, respectively. These values were similar to those found in fatal cases of hydrogen sulfide poisoning. Thiosulfate was not detected in the plasma of survivor D. With respect to urine samples, thiosulfate was the highest in the non-acute death victim C (137.20 mg/L), followed by that in the survivor D (29.34 mg/L), and low (0.90 mg/L) and not detected in the acute death victims, A and B, respectively. Based on these results, all four patients were victims of hydrogen sulfide poisoning. The concentrations of thiosulfate in blood and urine were more useful than that for sulfide for determining hydrogen sulfide poisoning. Thiosulfate in urine was the only indicator of hydrogen sulfide poisoning in the non-fatal victim.

7475869|t|Distribution of efferent cholinergic terminals and alpha-bungarotoxin binding to putative nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the human vestibular end-organs.
7475869|a|Although acetylcholine (ACh) has been identified as the primary neurotransmitter of the efferent vestibular system in most animals studied, no direct evidence exists that ACh is the efferent neurotransmitter of the human vestibular system. Choline acetyltransferase immunohistochemistry (ChATi), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) histochemistry, and alpha-bungarotoxin binding were used in human vestibular end-organs to address this question. ChATi and AChE activity was found in numerous bouton-type terminals contacting the basal area of type II vestibular hair cells and the afferent chalices surrounding type I hair cells; alpha-bungarotoxin binding suggested the presence of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on type II vestibular hair cells and on the afferent chalices surrounding type I hair cells. This study provides evidence that the human efferent vestibular axons and terminals are cholinergic and that the receptors receiving this innervation may be nicotinic.

26539255|t|EGCG Attenuates Uric Acid-Induced Inflammatory and Oxidative Stress Responses by Medicating the NOTCH Pathway.
26539255|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to investigate whether (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) can prevent the UA-induced inflammatory effect of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and the involved mechanisms in vitro. METHODS: HUVEC were subjected to uric acid (UA) with or without EGCG treatment. RT-PCR and western blots were performed to determine the level of inflammation marker. The antioxidant activity was evaluated by measuring scavenged reactive oxygen species (ROS). Functional studies of the role of Notch-1 in HUVEC lines were performed using RNA interference analyses. RESULTS: UA significantly increased the expressions of IL-6, ICAM-1, TNF-α, and MCP-1 and the production of ROS in HUVEC. Meanwhile, the expression of Notch-1 and its downstream effects significantly increased. Using siRNA, inhibition of Notch-1 signaling significantly impeded the expressions of inflammatory cytokines under UA treatment. Interestingly, EGCG suppressed the expressions of inflammatory cytokines and the generation of ROS. Western blot analysis of Notch-1 showed that EGCG significantly decreased the expressions of inflammatory cytokines through Notch-1 signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our findings indicated that Notch-1 plays an important role in the UA-induced inflammatory response, and the downregulation of Notch-1 by EGCG could be an effective approach to decrease inflammation and oxidative stress induced by UA.

18437032|t|Two autocrine pathways to regulate cyclic GMP synthesis in cultured human retinal pigment epithelial cells.
18437032|a|AIM: To investigate the role of two separate enzymatic pathways [soluble (sGC) vs. particulate (pGC) guanylyl cyclase] in the synthesis of cyclic GMP (cGMP) in cultured human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. METHODS: cGMP accumulation was evaluated by quantitative analysis of cGMP immunoreactivity. RPE cells were also stained for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), ANP and beta(1)- and alpha(2)-subunits of sGC. RESULTS: We showed nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) diaphorase activity and iNOS immunoreactivity in RPE cells. Incubation of the cells in the presence of 1 mM IBMX to inhibit phosphodiesterase activity, and the simultaneous inhibition of NOS activity with L-NAME suggested the involvement of sGC in maintaining a low level of cGMP in the RPE cells. The involvement of sGC was further supported by detection of the beta(1)- and alpha(2)-subunits of sGC. Incubation of the cells in the presence of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) to stimulate pGC strongly increased cGMP immunoreactivity. We also demonstrated the presence of ANP in all RPE cells. CONCLUSION: Cultured human RPE cells are capable of producing cGMP after stimulation of sGC or pGC. The presence of iNOS and ANP in all cells suggests two different autocrine pathways of stimulating cGMP production in these cells. The possible role of cGMP in the regulation iNOS gene expression and in the regulation of ANP is discussed.

15521360|t|D5 dopamine receptor knockout mice and hypertension.
15521360|a|Abnormalities in dopamine production and receptor function have been described in human essential hypertension and rodent models of genetic hypertension. All of the five dopamine receptor genes (D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5) expressed in mammals and some of their regulators are in loci linked to hypertension in humans and in rodents. Under normal conditions, D1-like receptors (D1 and D5) inhibit sodium transport in the kidney and the intestine. However, in the Dahl salt-sensitive and spontaneously hypertensive rats, and humans with essential hypertension, the D1-like receptor-mediated inhibition of sodium transport is impaired because of an uncoupling of the D1-like receptor from its G protein/effector complex. The uncoupling is genetic, and receptor-, organ-, and nephron segment-specific. In human essential hypertension, the uncoupling of the D1 receptor from its G protein/effector complex is caused by an agonist-independent serine phosphorylation/desensitization by constitutively active variants of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase type 4. The D5 receptor is also important in blood pressure regulation. Disruption of the D5 or the D1 receptor gene in mice increases blood pressure. However, unlike the D1 receptor, the hypertension in D5 receptor null mice is caused by increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system, apparently due to activation of oxytocin, V1 vasopressin, and non-N-methyl D-aspartate receptors in the central nervous system. The cause of the activation of these receptors remains to be determined.

24746619|t|Hsp27 suppresses the Cu(2+)-induced amyloidogenicity, redox activity, and cytotoxicity of α-synuclein by metal ion stripping.
24746619|a|Aberrant copper homeostasis and oxidative stress have critical roles in several neurodegenerative diseases. Expression of heat-shock protein 27 (Hsp27) is elevated under oxidative stress as well as upon treatment with Cu(2+), and elevated levels of Hsp27 are found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. We demonstrate, using steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy as well as isothermal titration calorimetry studies, that Hsp27 binds Cu(2+) with high affinity (Kd ~10(-11) M). Treating IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells with Cu(2+) leads to upregulation of endogenous Hsp27. Further, overexpression of Hsp27 in IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells confers cytoprotection against Cu(2+)-induced cell death. Hsp27 prevents the deleterious interaction of Cu(2+) with α-synuclein, the protein involved in Parkinson disease and synucleinopathies. Hsp27 attenuates Cu(2+)- or Cu(2+)-α-synuclein-mediated generation of reactive oxygen species and confers cytoprotection on IMR-32 cells as well as on mouse primary neural precursor cells. Hsp27 prevents Cu(2+)-ascorbate or Cu(2+)-α-synuclein-ascorbate treatment-induced increase in mitochondrial superoxide level and mitochondrial disorganization in IMR-32 cells. Hsp27 dislodges the α-synuclein-bound Cu(2+) and prevents the Cu(2+)-mediated amyloidogenesis of α-synuclein. Our findings that Hsp27 binds Cu(2+) with high affinity leading to beneficial effects and that Hsp27 can dislodge Cu(2+) from α-synuclein, preventing amyloid fibril formation, indicate potential therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases involving aberrant Cu(2+) homeostasis.

24094195|t|Purification of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase by using immobilized metal affinity cryogels.
24094195|a|In this study, poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-glycidylmethacrylate) [poly(HEMA-GMA)] cryogels were prepared by radical cryocopolymerization of HEMA with GMA as a functional comonomer and N,N'-methylene-bisacrylamide (MBAAm) as a crosslinker. Iminodiacetic acid (IDA) functional groups were attached via ring opening of the epoxy group on the poly(HEMA-GMA) cryogels and then Zn(II) ions were chelated with these structures. Characterization of cryogels was performed by FTIR, SEM, EDX and swelling studies. These cryogels have interconnected pores of 30-50 μm size. The equilibrium swelling degree of Zn(II) chelated poly(HEMA-GMA)-IDA cryogels was approximately 600%. Zn(II) chelated poly(HEMA-GMA)-IDA cryogels were used in the adsorption of alcohol dehydrogenase from aqueous solutions and adsorption was performed in continuous system. The effects of pH, alcohol dehydrogenase concentration, temperature, and flow rate on adsorption were investigated. The maximum amount of alcohol dehydrogenase adsorption was determined to be 9.94 mg/g cryogel at 1.0mg/mL alcohol dehydrogenase concentration and in acetate buffer at pH5.0 with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. Desorption of adsorbed alcohol dehydrogenase was carried out by using 1.0M NaCI at pH8.0 phosphate buffer and desorption yield was found to be 93.5%. Additionally, these cryogels were used for purification of alcohol dehydrogenase from yeast with a single-step. The purity of desorbed alcohol dehydrogenase was shown by silver-stained SDS-PAGE. This purification process can successfully be used for the purification of alcohol dehydrogenase from unclarified yeast homogenates and this work is the first report about the usage of the cryogels for purification of alcohol dehydrogenase.

10862882|t|Air pressure effects on biomass yield of two different Kluyveromyces strains.
10862882|a|The use of air pressure as a way of improving oxygen transfer in aerobic bioreactors was investigated. To compare the air pressure effects with traditional air bubbled cultures, experiments using a pressure reactor and a stirred flask, with the same oxygen transfer rate, were made. Kluyveromyces marxianus is an important industrial yeast and some of it show a "Kluyver effect" for lactose: even under oxygen limited growth conditions, certain disaccharides that support aerobic, respiratory growth, are not fermented. This study deals with the effect of increased pressure on the physiological behavior of two Kluyveromyces strains: K. marxianus ATCC10022 is a lactose-fermenting strain, whereas K. marxianus CBS 7894 has a Kluyver-effect for lactose. For K. marxianus ATCC10022 an air pressure increase of 2 bar led to a 3-fold increase in biomass yield. When air pressure increased an enhancement of ethanol oxidation of cell yeasts was also observed. Batch cultures of K. marxianus CBS 7894 exhibited different growth behaviour. Its metabolism was always oxidative and ethanol was never produced. With the increase in air pressure, it was possible to increase the productivity in biomass of K. marxianus CBS 7894. As a response to high oxygen concentrations, due to the increase in oxygen partial pressure, oxidative stress in the cells was also studied. Antioxidant defences, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione reductase, were at high activity levels, suggesting that these yeast strains could tolerate the increased pressures applied.

15808465|a|We have examined the stability of fluorescently-labelled oligonucleotides that are based on the human telomeric repeat [(GGGTTA)(3)GGG], in which one of the guanines in turn is substituted with inosine.

The data for potassium suggest a parallel arrangement of the strands, while the sodium form is mixed parallel and antiparallel.

8847182|t|Evidences of 4-hydroxynonenal involvement in modulation of phagocyte activities.
8847182|a|The peroxidative breakdown of membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids leads to the production of various carbonylic compounds: among these, 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) displays many biological properties related to neutrophil functions. It stimulates rat and human polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell migration and has been detected during inflammation. The aim of this study was to elucidate and well characterize the mechanism of action of HNE. We observed that micromolar HNE concentrations that influence migration do not stimulate differently from many other chemoattractants the human PMN chemiluminescence (CL) induced by opsonized zymosan or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Higher HNE concentrations inhibit the light emission of stimulated PMN. Addition of 0.5 mM L-arginine (L-arg), the substrate of nitric oxide synthase, into the incubation medium had the effect of modifying human CL. In fact, HNE at 10-6 M, a concentration which is ineffective in absence of L-Arg, at 10-5 M reduces CL emission of PMA-stimulated human PMN. These observations have been confirmed by electron-spin resonance (ESR) analysis. HNE, according to other stimuli, induced PMN phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PL-C). All these results considered together suggest the conclusion that HNE represents an interesting endogenous molecule that plays a role as an inflammatory mediator involved a) in the recruitment of phagocytic cells at the inflamed area, and b) in the modulation of respiratory burst and of nitric oxide (NO) production.

16935492|t|Iron enriched yeast biomass--a promising mineral feed supplement.
16935492|a|Yeast biomass enriched with iron could represent a new and safer solution for prevention from anaemia development. Such an iron source is less toxic and has better absorbability in organisms. The purpose of our research was the determination of the most suitable iron source in the cultivation medium for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, regarding good growth and iron accumulation in cells. Iron(III) citrate, iron(III) chloride, iron(III) nitrate and Fe-EDTA complex were used. The uptake of the chosen iron compound, Fe(III) citrate, by the yeasts Candida intermedia and Kluyveromyces marxianus was also investigated. Different growth behaviour of the three yeast strains in the presence of Fe(III) citrate was observed. The highest amounts of accumulated iron in S. cerevisiae, C. intermedia and K. marxianus biomass were about 13, 20 and 34mgFeg(-1)dry wt., respectively. To optimise the accumulation of iron in K. marxianus and to characterise iron enriched yeast biomass, further experiments are needed.

8114512|t|Antiinflammatory steroids inhibit granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor production by human lung tissue.
8114512|a|Granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is an important hematopoietic growth factor which has been shown to induce proliferation and activation of inflammatory cells, and may play a role in allergic diseases and experimental allergic reactions. Since little is known about the involvement of cytokines in allergic inflammation in the lung, we investigated whether human lung fragments produce GM-CSF in vitro. The present studies demonstrate that human lung fragments produce GM-CSF in vitro and that glucocorticoids are potent inhibitors of this cytokine production. Human lung was cut into fragments, rinsed, and cultured in 60-mm tissue culture plates containing 50 mg of tissue in RPMI 1640 with antibiotics in the presence or absence of a variety of steroids for 18 h. Lung fragments were rinsed and then incubated for an additional 4 h. Supernatants were harvested and analyzed for GM-CSF activity using the GM-CSF/interleukin (IL)-3 responsive M-07e human leukemic cell line. Steroids alone had no effect on M-07e proliferation. Human lung fragments produced 32.1 +/- 11.8 ng of GM-CSF equivalents per gram wet weight of tissue during the 4 h incubation (mean +/- S.E.M., n = 5, range 9.2-74.2). While specific antisera against human GM-CSF neutralized 96.8 +/- 2.8% (n = 5) of the activity, anti-IL-3 antibody had no effect, suggesting most or all of this activity was GM-CSF. Treatment of lung fragments in vitro for 18 h with hydrocortisone (HC) inhibited the production of GM-CSF dose-dependently. Maximal inhibition of GM-CSF production was 72.8 +/- 4.0% at a concentration of 10(-6) M hydrocortisone (n = 5), and the molar concentration of HC that inhibited of GM-CSF production by lung tissue by 50% (IC50) was approximately 4.5 x 10(-7) M. Kinetic studies revealed that a 6 h preincubation with the drug was required for 50% inhibition of GM-CSF production. HC and other glucocorticoids, at a concentration of 0.1 microM, demonstrated significant inhibition of GM-CSF release. Based on the rank order of potency of several glucocorticoids, and the fact that nonglucocorticoid steroids including testosterone and beta-estradiol (0.1 microM) had no effect, we suggest that this is a specific receptor-mediated effect. We conclude that human lung produces GM-CSF in vitro and that antiinflammatory steroids are potent and effective inhibitors of the production of this cytokine. This may contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of these drugs in pulmonary diseases.

15754147|t|Comparative study of apatite formation on CaSiO3 ceramics in simulated body fluids with different carbonate concentrations.
15754147|a|Apatite formation on CaSiO3 ceramics was investigated using two different simulated body fluids (SBF) proposed by Kokubo (1990) and Tas (2000) and three sample/SBF (S/S) ratios (1.0, 2.5 and 8.3 mg/ml) at 36.5 degrees C for 1-25 days. The CaSiO3 ceramic was prepared by firing coprecipitated gel with Ca/Si = 0.91 at 1400 degrees C. The bulk density was 2.14 g/cm3 and the relative density about 76%. The two SBF solutions contain different concentrations of HCO3- and Cl- ions, the concentrations of which are closer to human blood plasma in the Tas SBF formulation than in the Kokubo formulation. The pH values in the former solution are also more realistic. The CaSiO3 ceramics show apatite formation in SBF (Kokubo) after soaking for only 1 day at all S/S ratios whereas different phases were formed at each S/S ratio in SBF (Tas). The crystalline phases formed were mainly apatite at S/S = 1.0 mg/ml, carbonate-type apatite at 2.5 mg/ml and calcite at 8.3 mg/ml. At higher S/S ratios the increase in the Ca concentration became higher while the P concentration became lower in the reacted SBF. These changes in SBF concentrations and increasing pH occurred at higher S/S ratios, producing more favorable conditions in the SBF for the formation of carbonate bearing phases, finally leading to the formation of calcite instead of apatite in the higher HCO3- ion concentration SBF (Tas). Apatite is, however, formed in the lower HCO3- ion concentration SBF (Kokubo) even though the Ca and P concentrations change in a similar manner to SBF (Tas).

23030661|t|p53-Pathway activity and apoptosis in hydrogen sulfide-exposed stem cells separated from human gingival epithelium.
23030661|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Hydrogen sulfide ( H₂S ) is a volatile sulfur compound responsible for physiological halitosis. H₂S was also reported as having periodontal pathologic activities. Gingival crevicular epithelium is the first barrier against periodontal pathogens and their products; oral keratinocyte stem cells OKSCs play key roles in maintaining this barrier. The p53 pathway is responsible for regulating key biological events. Increased apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest of DNA repair can affect keratinocyte stem cells, having a direct impact on the architecture of the oral epithelial tissue. However, the link between H₂S , p53 activity and OKSCs has not yet been fully explored. The main objective of the present study was to explore the implications of the p53 pathway in OKSCs following exposure to H₂S. MATERIAL AND METHODS: OKSCs were isolated from human gingival epithelium and incubated with physiological levels of H₂S for 24 and 48 h. Apoptosis and the mitochondrial membrane potential were detected using flow cytometry. Cytochrome c, total p53, phosphorylated p53 and caspase activity were assessed using specific ELISAs. p53 Pathway gene activity was assayed using quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: The levels of apoptosis were significantly increased following incubation in the presence of H₂S, especially after 48 h (36.95 ± 1.91% vs. 4.77 ± 0.74%). Caspases 9 and 3 were activated, whereas caspase-8 activity remained low. Total p53 activity and particularly phosphorylated p53 at serine 46, were significantly enhanced compared with controls (47.11 ± 9.84 units/mL vs. 1.5 ± 0 units/mL and 32.22 ± 10.23 units/mL vs. 0.15 ± 0 units/mL, respectively, at 48 h). Among p53 pathway genes, apoptosis-related genes [i.e. phosphatase and tensin homolog ( PTEN ), B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 ( BCL2), sirtuin 3 ( SIRT3) and caspases]) were dramatically increased when compared with controls. Moreover, cell-cycle progression genes [i.e. E2F transcription factor (E2F) family and histone deacetylase ( HDAC )] and DNA-repair genes [i.e. growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible, gamma ( GADD45G ) family and serine/threonine-protein kinase Chk2 ( CHEK2)] were also increased. CONCLUSION: Following incubation with H2 S , OKSCs express multiple p53-associated genes, including programmed cell death, cell-cycle control and DNA-repair genes.

24576675|t|LRRK2, but not pathogenic mutants, protects against H2O2 stress depending on mitochondrial function and endocytosis in a yeast model.
24576675|a|BACKGROUND: Mutations in LRRK2 are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease (PD). Studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have provided valuable insights into the mechanisms of cellular dysfunction associated with the expression of faulty PD genes. METHODS: We developed a yeast model for full-length LRRK2 studies. We expressed wild-type (wt) LRRK2 and mutations and evaluated their role during oxidative stress conditions. The involvement of mitochondria was assessed by using rho-zero mutants and by evaluating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial membrane potential by flow cytometry. The involvement of endocytosis was also studied by testing several endocytic mutants and by following the vacuolar delivery of the probe FM4-64. RESULTS: Expression of LRRK2 in yeast was associated to increased hydrogen peroxide resistance. This phenotype, which was dependent on mitochondrial function, was not observed for PD-mutants G2019S and R1441C or in the absence of the kinase activity and the WD40 repeat domain. Expression of the pathogenic mutants stimulated ROS production and increased mitochondrial membrane potential. For the PD-mutants, but not for wild-type LRRK2, endocytic defects were also observed. Additionally, several endocytic proteins were required for LRRK2-mediated protection against hydrogen peroxide. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that LRRK2 confers cellular protection during oxidative stress depending on mitochondrial function and endocytosis. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Both the loss of capacity of LRRK2 pathogenic mutants to protect against oxidative stress and their enhancement of dysfunction may be important for the development of PD during the aging process.

12741470|t|Dose-response relationship and mechanism of action of Saccharomyces boulardii in castor oil-induced diarrhea in rats.
12741470|a|For biotherapeutic agents, there is a lack of information on dose-response relationships and mechanism of action. The present study was designed to address these issues for Saccharomyces boulardii using the rat model of castor oil-induced diarrhea. A single dose of Saccharomyces boulardii at 12 x 10(10) CFU/kg of viable cells given 1 hr before castor oil administration significantly reduced the onset of diarrhea. Repeated ingestion of the yeast, twice daily between 1.2 and 12 x 10(10) CFU/kg for 5 days before castor oil, showed a dose-response relationship. The percentage of rats with diarrhea decreased and a stronger protection was afforded by the repeated treatment. The mechanism of action of Saccharomyces boulardii in this model was investigated with two classes of antagonists, naloxone and L-arginine. The effect of Saccharomyces boulardii was not inhibited by naloxone but was significantly reduced by L-arginine. This last result suggests a novel mechanism of action for Saccharomyces boulardii involving a possible inhibition of nitric oxide production by the yeast.

21050250|t|A practical guide for the stabilization of acylghrelin in human blood collections.
21050250|a|OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: To better understand acylghrelin plasma stability, human synthetic acylghrelin was spiked into plasma and tracked by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. To investigate the best method for quantifying clinical plasma acylghrelin levels, pre- and postprandial human blood was collected from healthy volunteers (n=6) using various sample collections and treatments. Plasma ghrelin levels from human blood collections were analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Acylghrelin's half-life in plasma was approximately 45 min with the formation of des-acylghrelin approaching 50% before the end of the 60-min incubation. Loss of acylghrelin inversely correlated with an increase in des-acylghrelin (P<0.008; r(2) =0.870). Plasma pretreated with 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF) or protease inhibitor cocktail without acidification resulted in no detectible acylghrelin losses. Acylghrelin measurements with AEBSF-treated blood were minimally 40% higher than sodium citrate/citric acid, K(2) EDTA, aprotinin/HCl and P800 collections. HCl addition to AEBSF-treated plasma did not provide enhanced acylghrelin stability and induced deacylation at and above the 100 mM final concentration. Pre- and postprandial ghrelin attenuation was investigated using aprotinin/HCl, AEBSF, protease inhibitor cocktail and no treatment for blood and plasma preparations. Fasting samples treated with AEBSF and protease inhibitor cocktail were approximately threefold higher than aprotinin/HCl and control treatments (P<0.03). Pre- and postprandial ghrelin attenuation was approximately twofold different (P<0.04) with significant counterintuitive trends in aprotinin/HCl and K(2) EDTA groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that AEBSF addition to K(2) EDTA blood immediately after collection without plasma acidification, processing on ice and 14-day 70 °C storage is the best treatment for accurately quantifying acylghrelin in human plasma.

11920514|t|31Phosphorus-magnetic resonance spectroscopy to assess histologic tumor response noninvasively after isolated limb perfusion for soft tissue tumors.
11920514|a|BACKGROUND: In patients with unresectable soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities, isolated limb perfusion (ILP) has been reported to result in significant tumor regression enabling limb-sparing resection in the majority of patients. However, clinical tumor response as evaluated by imaging and histopathology (extent of tumor necrosis) often differ significantly. The current study was initiated to evaluate prospectively the role of 31phosphorus-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) in the noninvasive assessment of histologic response in patients treated with ILP. METHODS: Thirty-two patients with locally advanced and unresectable soft tissue tumors (sarcoma in 28 patients and bulky melanoma in 4 patients) were treated by ILP with recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-alpha and melphalan or with cytostatics. 31P-MRS was performed prior to treatment and at regular intervals after ILP until definite tumor resection. Clinical response parameters according to the World Health Organization as well as the histopathologic necrosis rate of the resection specimen were correlated with changes in the energy-rich phosphorous metabolites phosphocreatine (PCR); alpha-, beta-, gamma-adenosine triphosphate (ATP); phosphomonoesters (PME); and inorganic phosphate (Pi). RESULTS: Clinically, 15 of 32 patients (response rate [RR] of 47%) demonstrated a partial response (PR). The ratios of PME/PCR and PME/beta-ATP decreased significantly after ILP in comparison with preoperative values (P < 0.001). The changes in the PME/beta-ATP ratio were significantly different between clinical responders and nonresponders (P < 0.02) in contrast with the PME/PCR ratios (P < 0.09). Histologic necrosis of > 90% (pathologic (p) PR) was present in 17 resection specimens, 7 of which demonstrated no clinical response. Seven tumors demonstrated a pathologic complete response (pCR). When combining PR, pPR, and pCR (RR of 68%), 31P-MRS was able to predict response with a specificity of 94% and a sensitivity of 68% (P < 0.006, by the chi-square test). CONCLUSIONS: The considerable difference between clinical and pathologic RR after ILP underlines the shortcomings of established response criteria. Utilizing changes in PME/beta-ATP ratios, 31P-MRS is a highly specific tool with which to predict histologic response in this setting. This finding may be of major value in those patients in whom the decision to perform a major resection or amputation must be made for local tumor control.

23994555|t|Safflor yellow B suppresses angiotensin II-mediated human umbilical vein cell injury via regulation of Bcl-2/p22(phox) expression.
23994555|a|Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) are derived from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase. Angiotensin II (Ang II) can cause endothelial dysfunction by promoting intracellular ROS generation. Safflor yellow B (SYB) effectively inhibits ROS generation by upregulating Bcl-2 expression. In this study, we examined the effects of SYB on Ang II-induced injury to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and elucidated the roles of NADPH oxidase and Bcl-2. We treated cultured HUVECs with Ang II, SYB, and Bcl-2 siRNA, and determined NADPH oxidase activity and ROS levels. Furthermore, cellular and mitochondrial physiological states were evaluated, and the expression levels of target proteins were analyzed. Ang II significantly enhanced intracellular ROS levels, caused mitochondrial membrane dysfunction, and decreased cell viability, leading to apoptosis. This was associated with increased expression of AT1R and p22(phox), increased NADPH oxidase activity, and an increased ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, leading to decreases in antioxidant enzyme activities, which were further strengthened after blocking Bcl-2. Compared to Ang II treatment alone, co-treatment with SYB significantly reversed HUVEC injury. Taken together, these results demonstrate that SYB could significantly protect endothelial cells from Ang II-induced cell damage, and that it does so by upregulating Bcl-2 expression and inhibiting ROS generation.

8728025|t|Isoluminol-enhanced chemiluminescence: a sensitive method to study the release of superoxide anion from human neutrophils.
8728025|a|A very sensitive chemiluminescence (CL) method was developed for the determination of respiratory burst products generated by the NADPH-oxidase in human neutrophils. Despite the fact that the CL reaction is peroxidase dependent, hydrogen peroxide was found not to participate in the light generating reaction. Phagocytic cells were mixed with isoluminol, a chemiluminescence substrate that detects extracellularly released oxygen species only. Owing to the fact that the availability of released cellular myeloperoxidase is a limiting factor in the reaction, extra peroxidase (horseradish peroxidase; HRP) has to be added to the measuring system. From the fact that the response to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), as well as to formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) was almost totally inhibited by superoxide dismutase (SOD), we conclude that O2.- is the reacting oxygen species measured. The assay system described is well suited for real-time studies of superoxide anion release from activated neutrophils. With the technique, the release of O2.- can be detected from as few as 250 neutrophils.

10233149|t|Glucose-induced autophagy of peroxisomes in Pichia pastoris requires a unique E1-like protein.
10233149|a|Cytosolic and peroxisomal enzymes necessary for methanol assimilation are synthesized when Pichia pastoris is grown in methanol. Upon adaptation from methanol to a glucose environment, these enzymes are rapidly and selectively sequestered and degraded within the yeast vacuole. Sequestration begins when the vacuole changes shape and surrounds the peroxisomes. The opposing membranes then fuse, engulfing the peroxisome. In this study, we have characterized a mutant cell line (glucose-induced selective autophagy), gsa7, which is defective in glucose-induced selective autophagy of peroxisomes, and have identified the GSA7 gene. Upon glucose adaptation, gsa7 cells were unable to degrade peroxisomal alcohol oxidase. We observed that the peroxisomes were surrounded by the vacuole, but complete uptake into the vacuole did not occur. Therefore, we propose that GSA7 is not required for initiation of autophagy but is required for bringing the opposing vacuolar membranes together for homotypic fusion, thereby completing peroxisome sequestration. By sequencing the genomic DNA fragment that complemented the gsa7 phenotype, we have found that GSA7 encodes a protein of 71 kDa (Gsa7p) with limited sequence homology to a family of ubiquitin-activating enzymes, E1. The knockout mutant gsa7Delta had an identical phenotype to gsa7, and both mutants were rescued by an epitope-tagged Gsa7p (Gsa7-hemagglutinin [HA]). In addition, a GSA7 homolog, APG7, a protein required for autophagy in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was capable of rescuing gsa7. We have sequenced the human homolog of GSA7 and have shown many regions of identity between the yeast and human proteins. Two of these regions align to the putative ATP-binding domain and catalytic site of the family of ubiquitin activating enzymes, E1 (UBA1, UBA2, and UBA3). When either of these sites was mutated, the resulting mutants [Gsa7(DeltaATP)-HA and Gsa7(C518S)-HA] were unable to rescue gsa7 cells. We provide evidence to suggest that Gsa7-HA formed a thio-ester linkage with a 25-30 kDa protein. This conjugate was not observed in cells expressing Gsa7(DeltaATP)-HA or in cells expressing Gsa7(C518S)-HA. Our results suggest that this unique E1-like enzyme is required for homotypic membrane fusion, a late event in the sequestration of peroxisomes by the vacuole.

6546635|t|Serum concentrations of vitamin D metabolites in exclusively breast-fed infants at 70 degrees north.
6546635|a|The effect of prolonged breast-feeding on the serum concentrations of vitamin D metabolites, calcium, phosphate, and alkaline phosphatase was studied longitudinally in 7 infants from Northern Norway. They were exclusively breast-fed for a median of 7 1/2 months. Three of the mothers were supplemented with vitamin D throughout lactation. All but one of the infants had 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels in the rachitic range (less than 20 nmol/l) on at least one occasion. Vitamin D supplementation of the mother had no apparent effect on the infants' 25-OHD levels, but the values increased during summer. The infant who had the lowest 25-OHD levels also had decreased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-(OH)2D) concentrations, while the others maintained 1,25-(OH)2D levels within normal limits. 24,25-(OH)2D concentrations were undetectable when the 25-OHD levels were below 35 nmol/l, but the two metabolites were closely correlated for higher values of 25-OHD. Low 25-OHD levels were associated with decreased phosphate concentrations at 6 months. The calcium levels were normal throughout the study period of one year, as were all but two of the alkaline phosphatase values. Although none of the infants had clinical or biochemical evidence of rickets, the results suggest that the vitamin D supply from human milk is inadequate, and that routine vitamin D supplementation is advisable for breast-fed infants who are deprived of sunlight exposure.

20969759|t|A multi-level study of recombinant Pichia pastoris in different oxygen conditions.
20969759|a|BACKGROUND: Yeasts are attractive expression platforms for many recombinant proteins, and there is evidence for an important interrelation between the protein secretion machinery and environmental stresses. While adaptive responses to such stresses are extensively studied in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, little is known about their impact on the physiology of Pichia pastoris. We have recently reported a beneficial effect of hypoxia on recombinant Fab secretion in P. pastoris chemostat cultivations. As a consequence, a systems biology approach was used to comprehensively identify cellular adaptations to low oxygen availability and the additional burden of protein production. Gene expression profiling was combined with proteomic analyses and the 13C isotope labelling based experimental determination of metabolic fluxes in the central carbon metabolism. RESULTS: The physiological adaptation of P. pastoris to hypoxia showed distinct traits in relation to the model yeast S. cerevisiae. There was a positive correlation between the transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolic fluxes adaptation of P. pastoris core metabolism to hypoxia, yielding clear evidence of a strong transcriptional regulation component of key pathways such as glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway and TCA cycle. In addition, the adaptation to reduced oxygen revealed important changes in lipid metabolism, stress responses, as well as protein folding and trafficking. CONCLUSIONS: This systems level study helped to understand the physiological adaptations of cellular mechanisms to low oxygen availability in a recombinant P. pastoris strain. Remarkably, the integration of data from three different levels allowed for the identification of differences in the regulation of the core metabolism between P. pastoris and S. cerevisiae. Detailed comparative analysis of the transcriptomic data also led to new insights into the gene expression profiles of several cellular processes that are not only susceptible to low oxygen concentrations, but might also contribute to enhanced protein secretion.

11902565|t|Role of nitric oxide in carcinogenesis and tumour progression.
11902565|a|Nitric oxide (NO) is a short-lived molecule required for many physiological functions, produced from L-arginine by NO synthases (NOS). It is a free radical, producing many reactive intermediates that account for its bioactivity. Sustained induction of the inducible form of NOS (iNOS) in chronic inflammation may be mutagenic, through NO-mediated DNA damage or hindrance to DNA repair, and thus potentially carcinogenic. Expression of iNOS is positively associated with P53 mutation in tumours of the colon, lung, and oropharynx. Progression of a large majority of human and experimental tumours seems to be stimulated by NO resulting from activation of iNOS or constitutive NOS, whereas inhibition is documented in others. This discrepancy is largely explained by differential sensitivity of tumour cells to NO-mediated cytostasis or apoptosis and clonal evolution of NO-resistant and NO-dependent cells. P53 mutation or loss is one of many events linked with NO resistance and dependence. NO can stimulate tumour growth and metastasis by promoting migratory, invasive, and angiogenic abilities of tumour cells, which may also be triggered by activation of cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2. Thus, selective inhibitors of NOS, COX, or both may have a therapeutic role in certain cancers.

26626025|t|Rapid, efficient, and simple motor neuron differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells.
26626025|a|BACKGROUND: Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are being applied in regenerative medicine and for the in vitro modeling of human intractable disorders. In particular, neural cells derived from disease-specific human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) established from patients with neurological disorders have been used as in vitro disease models to recapitulate in vivo pathogenesis because neural cells cannot be usually obtained from patients themselves. RESULTS: In this study, we established a rapid, efficient, and simple method for efficiently deriving motor neurons from hPSCs that is useful for pathophysiological analysis and the development of drugs to treat motor neuron diseases. Treatment with GSK3β inhibitors during the initial phase of differentiation in combination with dual SMAD inhibition was sufficient to induce PAX6 (+) and SOX1 (+) neural progenitors within 1 week, and subsequent treatment with retinoic acid (RA) and purmorphamine, which activates sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling, resulted in the highly efficient induction of HB9(+) and ISL-1(+) motor neurons within 2 weeks. After 4 weeks of monolayer differentiation in motor neuron maturation medium, hPSC-derived motor neurons were shown to mature, displaying larger somas and clearer staining for the mature motor neuron marker choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Moreover, hPSC-derived motor neurons were able to form neuromuscular junctions with human myotubes in vitro and induced acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering, as detected by Alexa 555-conjugated α-Bungarotoxin (α-BTX), suggesting that these hPSC-derived motor neurons formed functional contacts with skeletal muscles. This differentiation system is simple and is reproducible in several hiPSC clones, thereby minimizing clonal variation among hPSC clones. We also established a system for visualizing motor neurons with a lentiviral reporter for HB9 (HB9 (e438) ::Venus). The specificity of this reporter was confirmed through immunocytochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR analysis of high-positive fractions obtained via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), suggesting its applicability for motor neuron-specific analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our motor neuron differentiation system and lentivirus-based reporter system for motor neurons facilitate the analysis of disease-specific hiPSCs for motor neuron diseases.

6634830|t|Human blood acetaldehyde concentration during ethanol oxidation (update 1982).
6634830|a|A wide variety of levels of human blood acetaldehyde have been reported in the past. During the last few years, however, it has become increasingly evident that most, if not all, of the previously observed acetaldehyde concentrations during normal (i.e., no deficiency in, or inhibition of, aldehyde dehydrogenase activity) ethanol oxidation merely reflected artefactual acetaldehyde formed during the analytical procedures. The artefactual acetaldehyde formation, which occurs mainly during blood protein precipitation, is effectively minimized by the recently improved PCA method in which blood is immediately mixed with a perchloric acid-saline solution, and by the semicarbazide method in which blood is treated with a fresh isotonic semicarbazide solution before removal of the plasma. Nevertheless, a procedure involving control blood with ethanol added should be employed to control for any artefactual acetaldehyde still produced. Based on the improved analytical procedures, no detectable acetaldehyde was found in the venous blood of Caucasian subjects after acute ethanol intake.

19702871|t|Growth phase-dependent variations in transcript profiles for thioredoxin- and glutathione-dependent redox systems followed by budding and hyphal Candida albicans cultures.
19702871|a|We report the absolute transcription profiles of 24 genes coding for putative thioredoxin (Trx)- and glutathione (GSH)-dependent redox system components, accompanying the Candida albicans batch culture growth, under either yeast or hyphal conditions. All mRNAs investigated (plus the housekeeping ACT1) displayed significant alterations in their steady-state copy number. Collectively, these quantifications show that: (1) the most abundant mRNAs during active growth coded for putative thiol peroxidases (TSA1, PRX1, AHP11 and AHP12) and for donor thioredoxin Trx1p, i.e. those five mRNAs represented >74% of all transcript molecules quantified in a late exponential phase; (2) the transcripts under study differed between budding and hyphal cells not only in their abundance but also in their profiles throughout the growth stages; (3) mRNA amounts for four GSH-transferase putative genes (GTT12, GTT13, GTT14 and GST3) increased in the stationary phase in yeast but not under filamentous conditions. Hydrogen peroxide resistance, plus GSH, GSSG and reactive oxygen species contents, throughout yeast and hyphal growth, were also studied, and the differences observed were related to the transcript profiles.

3520568|t|Carbon source regulation of RAS1 expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the phenotypes of ras2- cells.
3520568|a|Transcriptional analysis of the yeast RAS genes in different culture conditions suggests that the inability of ras2 mutants to grow in nonfermentable carbon sources results from the regulation of RAS1 mRNA expression. The amount of RAS1 mRNA is significantly repressed in cultures grown on the nonfermentable carbon sources ethanol and acetate. As a result, low RAS function should be expressed under these conditions in a ras2 mutant. This can explain the inability of ras2- cells to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources. This interpretation is supported by the finding that an extragenic suppressor of ras2- (sra6-15), which restores growth on ethanol or acetate, also leads to an increase in the amount of RAS1 mRNA under these conditions. The sra6-15 mutation does not alter the level of RAS1 mRNA in cells grown on glucose. The pattern of transcriptional regulation described for the RAS1 gene is not shared by RAS2, indicating differential control of the functionally homologous yeast RAS genes at the level of gene expression.

15708472|t|Direct binding of estradiol enhances Slack (sequence like a calcium-activated potassium channel) channels' activity.
15708472|a|17Beta-estradiol (E2) is a major neuroregulator, exerting both genomic and non-genomic actions. E2 regulation of Slack (sequence like a calcium-activated potassium channel) potassium channels has not been identified in the CNS. We demonstrate E2-induced activation of Slack channels, which display a unitary conductance of about 60 pS, are inhibited by intracellular calcium, and are abundantly expressed in the nervous system. In lipid bilayers derived from rat cortical neuronal membranes, E2 increases Slack open probability and appears to decrease channel inactivation. Additionally, E2 binds to the Slack channel and activates outward currents in human embryonic kidney-293 cells that express Slack channels but not classical estrogen receptors (i.e. ERalpha or ERbeta). Neither E2-induced activation nor the binding intensity of E2 to the Slack channel is blocked by tamoxifen, an ER antagonist/agonist. Thus, E2 activates a potassium channel, Slack, through a non-traditional membrane binding site, adding to known non-genomic mechanisms by which E2 exerts pharmacological and toxicological effects in the CNS.

17033005|t|Effect of cis-urocanic acid on bovine neutrophil generation of reactive oxygen species.
17033005|a|Neutrophils play a fundamental role in the host innate immune response during mastitis and other bacterial-mediated diseases of cattle. One of the critical mechanisms by which neutrophils contribute to host innate immune defenses is through their ability to phagocytose and kill bacteria. The ability of neutrophils to kill bacteria is mediated through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the extracellular release of ROS can be deleterious to the host because ROS induce tissue injury. Thus, in diseases such as mastitis that are accompanied by the influx of neutrophils, the generation of large quantities of ROS may result in significant injury to the mammary epithelium. cis-Urocanic acid (cis-UCA), which is formed from the UV photoisomerization of the trans isoform found naturally in human and animal skin, is an immunosuppressive molecule with anti-inflammatory properties. Little is known about the effect of cis-UCA on neutrophils, although one report demonstrated that it inhibits human neutrophil respiratory burst activity. However, the nature of this inhibition remains unknown. Because of the potential therapeutic use that a molecule such as cis-UCA may have in blocking excessive respiratory burst activity that may be deleterious to the host, the ability of cis-UCA to inhibit bovine neutrophil production of ROS was studied. Further, because neutrophil generation of ROS is necessary for optimal neutrophil bactericidal activity, a response which is critical for the host innate immune defense against infection, the effects of cis-UCA on bovine neutrophil phagocytosis and bacterial killing were assayed. cis-Urocanic acid dose-dependently inhibited the respiratory burst activity of bovine neutrophils as measured by luminol chemiluminescence. Subsequently, the effect of cis-UCA on the production of specific oxygen radicals was investigated using more selective assays. Using 2 distinct assays, we established that cis-UCA inhibited the generation of extracellular superoxide. In contrast, cis-UCA had no effect on the generation of intracellular levels of superoxide or other ROS. At concentrations that inhibited generation of extracellular superoxide, bovine neutrophil phagocytosis and bacterial activity remained intact. Together, these data suggest that cis-UCA inhibits the tissue-damaging generation of extracellular ROS while preserving neutrophil bactericidal activity.

2985869|t|Surface contact inhibits neutrophil superoxide generation induced by soluble stimuli.
2985869|a|Human neutrophils in suspension undergo a metabolic burst and generate reactive O2- metabolites upon exposure to many soluble and particulate stimuli. They can also be stimulated to produce O2- when in contact with surfaces. We found that when neutrophils were allowed to settle into protein-coated surfaces the amount of O2- they generated varied with the nature of the protein: IgG greater than bovine serum albumin greater than plastic greater than gelatin greater than serum greater than collagen. However, when polymorphonuclear leukocytes were permitted to settle onto a surface and then were stimulated with either phorbol myristate acetate or N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine the O2- response was greatly diminished compared to control cells that were exposed to the stimulus in suspension. In contrast, superoxide production in response to the particulate stimulus opsonized zymosan was similar in both suspended and settled neutrophils. The degree of inhibition was not related to the degree of adherence since the diminished response occurred with all of the surfaces tested and in the presence of cytochalasin B. Onset of inhibition was very rapid as was recovery when cells were resuspended. Whereas production of O2- was greatly inhibited by surface contact, release of lysosomal enzymes was only slightly affected. The effect of surface contact did not appear to be mediated via activation of adenylate cyclase since the combination of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor and exogenous dibuteryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate did not inhibit phorbal myristate acetate O2- production, but surface contact did. These data indicate that surface contact such as would occur during diapedesis and chemotaxis profoundly alters neutrophil behavior by an unknown mechanism and imply that observations made on polymorphonuclear leukocytes in suspension cannot be generalized to polymorphonuclear leukocytes in tissue.

25164923|t|Nitrate and nitrite in the diet: how to assess their benefit and risk for human health.
25164923|a|Nitrate is a natural constituent of the human diet and an approved food additive. It can be partially converted to nitrogen monoxide, which induces vasodilation and thereby decreases blood pressure. This effect is associated with a reduced risk regarding cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Moreover, dietary nitrate has been associated with beneficial effects in patients with gastric ulcer, renal failure, or metabolic syndrome. Recent studies indicate that such beneficial health effects due to dietary nitrate may be achievable at intake levels resulting from the daily consumption of nitrate-rich vegetables. N-nitroso compounds are endogenously formed in humans. However, their relevance for human health has not been adequately explored up to now. Nitrate and nitrite are per se not carcinogenic, but under conditions that result in endogenous nitrosation, it cannot be excluded that ingested nitrate and nitrite may lead to an increased cancer risk and may probably be carcinogenic to humans. In this review, the known beneficial and detrimental health effects related to dietary nitrate/nitrite intake are described and the identified gaps in knowledge as well as the research needs required to perform a reliable benefit/risk assessment in terms of long-term human health consequences due to dietary nitrate/nitrite intake are presented.

3033110|t|Detection of the production of oxygen-centered free radicals by human neutrophils using spin trapping techniques: a critical perspective.
3033110|a|Human neutrophils generate oxygen reduction products as a consequence of membrane interactions with a number of stimuli. One oxygen-centered free radical (superoxide) has been unequivocally shown to result from this "respiratory burst," and some experimental evidence for another (hydroxyl radical) has been published, although debate remains as to its significance. The role of phagocyte-derived free radicals in microbicidal and tumoricidal activity as well as tissue damage at sites of inflammation has been the focus of extensive investigation in recent years. Of the techniques available to study free radical generation in biological systems, spin trapping has emerged as a powerful tool for detection and identification of these reactive species, owing in part to its ability to measure production of free radicals inside the phagosome. However, interpretation of resulting spectra is extremely complex and filled with pitfalls and limitations. In this communication we review spin-trapping techniques and discuss the application of this system to the identification of free radicals resulting from stimulation of human neutrophils. Criteria are established which are necessary for definitive identification of superoxide and hydroxyl radical when employing this technology. In this context a critical perspective of previous studies of neutrophil-derived free radicals is offered.

7814363|t|Evidence for Cu(II) reduction as a component of copper uptake by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
7814363|a|The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains a plasma membrane reductase activity associated with the gene product of the FRE1 locus. This reductase is required for Fe(III) uptake by this yeast; transcription from FRE1 is repressed by iron (Dancis, A., Klausner, R. D., Hinnebusch, A. G., and Barriocanal, J. G. (1990) Mol. Cell. Biol. 10, 2294-2301). We show here that Cu(II) is equally efficient at repressing FRE1 transcription and is an excellent substrate for the Fre1p reductase. This reductase activity is required for 50-70% of the uptake of 64Cu by wild type cells. Under conditions of low Fre1-dependent activity, cells retain 30-70% of Cu(II) reductase activity but only 8-25% of Fe(III) reductase activity. While Fre1p-dependent activity is 100% inhibitable by Pt(II), this residual Cu(II) reduction is insensitive to this inhibitor. The data suggest the presence of a Fre1p-independent reductase activity in the yeast plasma membrane which is relatively specific for Cu(II) and which supports copper uptake in the absence of FRE1 expression. The gene product of MAC1, which is required for regulation of FRE1 transcription, is also required for expression of Cu(II) reduction activity. This is due in part to its role in the regulation of FRE1; however, it is required for expression of the putative Cu(II) reductase, as well. Similarly, a gain-of-function mutation, MAC1up1, which causes elevated and unregulated transcription from FRE1 and elevated Fe(III) reduction and 59Fe uptake exhibits a similar phenotype with respect to Cu(II) reduction and 64Cu uptake. Ascorbate, which reduces periplasmic Cu(II) to Cu(I), suppresses the dependence of 64Cu uptake on plasma membrane reductase activity as is the case for ascorbate-supported 59Fe uptake. The close parallels between Cu(II) and Fe(III) reduction, and 64Cu and 59Fe uptake, strongly suggest that Cu(II) uptake by yeast involves a Cu(I) intermediate. This results in the reductive mobilization of the copper from periplasmic chelating agents, making the free ion available for translocation across the plasma membrane.

15096052|t|Domain-specific effector interactions within the central cavity of human adult hemoglobin in solution and in porous sol-gel matrices: evidence for long-range communication pathways.
15096052|a|The water-filled central cavity of human adult hemoglobin (Hb A) is the binding or interaction site for many different allosteric effectors. Oxygen binding titrations reveal that pyrenetetrasulfonate (PyTS), a fluorescent analogue of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, behaves like an allosteric effector. The ligation state, pH, and concentrations of other effectors (IHP, L35, and chloride) alter PyTS fluorescence for both solution-phase and sol-gel-encapsulated Hb samples. These conditions also alter the resonance Raman spectra and rates of geminate recombination of CO-ligated Hb. Together, these results demonstrate that there are conformational and functional consequences resulting from interactions between specific domains of the central cavity and individual effectors as well as from long-range synergistic effects that are mediated through the central cavity.

26824002|t|Discrepancy between Measured Serum Total Carbon Dioxide Content and Bicarbonate Concentration Calculated from Arterial Blood Gases.
26824002|a|Large differences between the concentrations of serum total carbon dioxide (TCO2) and blood gas bicarbonate (HCO3 (-)) were observed in two consecutive simultaneously drawn sets of samples of serum and arterial blood gases in a patient who presented with severe carbon dioxide retention and profound acidemia. These differences could not be explained by the effect of the high partial pressure of carbon dioxide on TCO2, by variations in the dissociation constant of the carbonic acid/bicarbonate system or by faults caused by the algorithms of the blood gas apparatus that calculate HCO3 (-). A recalculation using the Henderson-Hasselbach equation revealed arterial blood gas HCO3 (-) values close to the corresponding serum TCO2 values and clarified the diagnosis of the acid-base disorder, which had been placed in doubt by the large differences between the reported TCO2 and HCO3 (-) values. Human error in the calculation of HCO3 (-) was identified as the source of these differences. Recalculation of blood gas HCO3 (-) should be the first step in identifying the source of large differences between serum TCO2 and blood gas HCO3 (-).

23002105|t|Pseudohyphal growth of Cryptococcus neoformans is a reversible dimorphic transition in response to ammonium that requires Amt1 and Amt2 ammonium permeases.
23002105|a|Cryptococcus neoformans is a human-pathogenic basidiomycete that commonly infects HIV/AIDS patients to cause meningoencephalitis (7, 19). C. neoformans grows as a budding yeast during vegetative growth or as hyphae during sexual reproduction. Pseudohyphal growth of C. neoformans has been observed rarely during murine and human infections but frequently during coculture with amoeba; however, the genetics underlying pseudohyphal growth are largely unknown. Our studies found that C. neoformans displays pseudohyphal growth under nitrogen-limiting conditions, especially when a small amount of ammonium is available as a sole nitrogen source. Pseudohyphal growth was observed with Cryptococcus neoformans serotypes A and D and Cryptococcus gattii. C. neoformans pseudohyphae bud to produce yeast cells and normal smooth hemispherical colonies when transferred to complete media, indicating that pseudohyphal growth is a conditional developmental stage. Subsequent analysis revealed that two ammonium permeases encoded by the AMT1 and AMT2 genes are required for pseudohyphal growth. Both amt1 and amt2 mutants are capable of forming pseudohyphae; however, amt1 amt2 double mutants do not form pseudohyphae. Interestingly, C. gattii pseudohypha formation is irreversible and involves a RAM pathway mutation that drives pseudohyphal development. We also found that pseudohyphal growth is related to the invasive growth into the medium. These results demonstrate that pseudohyphal growth is a common reversible growth pattern in C. neoformans but a mutational genetic event in C. gattii and provide new insights into understanding pseudohyphal growth of Cryptococcus.

12833201|t|Nitric oxide and inflammatory response in simulated extracorporeal circulation.
12833201|a|BACKGROUND: Simulated extracorporeal circulation (SECC) induces inflammatory reaction. Nitric oxide (NO) has pro-and anti-inflammatory properties. NO role in SECC-related inflammatory response is unclear. The aim of this study was to clarify if NO affects the foreign-surface induced leukocyte activation during SECC. METHODS: Human blood was circulated through SECC during 3 hours. Control group C was ventilated with oxygen/air mixture and the study group with oxygen/air mixture and NO. Leukocyte activation was measured as serum levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO), human neutrophil lipocalin (HNL), lactoferrin (LF), interleukin-1-beta (IL-1 beta) and interleukin-10 (IL-10). Oxygen free radical production capacity was evaluated with chemiluminescence. NO metabolites nitrite/nitrate were estimated in serum. RESULTS: Leukocyte granule release increased over time. Addition of NO significantly increased MPO, HNL and LF release. The average difference increased with SECC duration. NO addition did not significantly affect measured interleukins concentration or oxygen free radical production capacity. NO metabolites increased significantly in the NO circuits. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that NO addition during SECC is pro-inflammatory and has no effect on oxygen free radical production and interleukin release.

12585696|t|Serotonin transporter modulation in blood lymphocytes from patients with major depression.
12585696|a|1. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system which has been implicated in the aetiology and pathogenesis of affective disorders. The serononergic system also plays several roles in the immune system through the expression of a number of its receptor subtypes in the immune cells. 2. Following release serotonin is inactivated by reuptake into neurons and other cells by a specific serotonin sodium and chloride-dependent transporter molecule, whose structure has been elucidated. 3. Measurement [3H]paroxetine binding showed that human lymphocytes contain a high-affinity serotonin transporter. 4. To assess the serotonin function in major depression, we investigated serotonin transporter density in blood lymphocytes from patients with this disorder and selected according to the interview of the American Psychiatric Association. 5. Patients were divided into two groups and treated with two different antidepressant drugs, one group receiving fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, and another mirtazapine, an antagonist of alpha2-adrenergic auto and heteroreceptors, for a period of 6 weeks. 6. Blood samples were obtained before and after the treatment, lymphocytes were isolated by Ficoll/Hypaque gradient, subjected to differential adhesion to plastic, and cell membranes were prepared for binding assay of [3H]paroxetine. 7. Lymphocytes serotonin transporter number was significantly reduced, while the affinity was unchanged, in patients with major depression disorder as compare to controls. 8. In addition, there was a partial recovery in lymphocytes serotonin (5HT) transporter number in the period posterior to the antidepressants administration, accompanied with clinical and depression rating scales improvement. Serotonin was determined in platelet-poor plasma and in lymphocytes before and after drugs administration, showing a significant decrease in the patients treated compared to untreated and controls. 9. These results are evidence of the potential interaction between the nervous and immune systems. The mechanisms underlying this interaction are under study, and might be related to modifications in the expression or function of the serotonin transporters in lymphocytes of depressed patients.

3743638|t|Effect of calcium antagonist darodipine on the isolated human heart.
3743638|a|Darodipine is a new light stable dihydropyridine calcium antagonist. In isolated large conductance vessels from experimental animals, darodipine blocks the potential-dependent but not the receptor-operated calcium channel. We studied the effects of darodipine in isolated human epicardial coronary arteries and in isolated right ventricular trabecula obtained from the explanted hearts of patients undergoing cardiac transplantation. In the coronary artery, the PD'2 for calcium was 9.7 and for carbachol was 9.5. In the cardiac muscle, the PD'2 for calcium was 6.5. Using 45Ca2+, darodipine blocked uptake in presence of potassium and histamine. We conclude that darodipine is (1) a potent calcium antagonist in the isolated human coronary artery, but not in ventricular myocardium, thus showing very pronounced target tissue selectivity, and (2) in contrast to findings obtained in rabbit aorta, it inhibits contraction and 45Ca2+ uptake mediated by both the potential-dependent and receptor-operated channels in the human epicardial coronary artery.

11106946|t|Hydrogen peroxide augments eosinophil adhesion via beta2 integrin.
11106946|a|During eosinophil (EOS) accumulation at sites of allergic inflammation, an initial step is the binding of EOS to adhesion molecules expressed on vascular endothelial cells (EC). We have previously observed that adhesion of peripheral blood EOS to recombinant human vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (rh-VCAM-1) stimulates the respiratory burst of EOS. Although the biological consequence of this activation remains to be elucidated, reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) may modify the adhesive property of EOS. In the present study, we examined whether H2O2 modifies the adhesive property of EOS. EOS were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy subjects. Adhesion of the EOS to paraformaldehyde-fixed human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC), stimulated or not stimulated with tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha; 100 pM for 24 hr), was examined in the presence or absence of H2O2. H2O2 significantly enhanced adhesion of EOS to both resting and TNF-alpha-stimulated fixed HUVEC (P < 0.01, respectively). Such enhancing effects were inhibited by anti-beta2 integrin antibody or anti-CD11b antibody, but not by anti-CD11a or anti-alpha4 integrin antibody. H2O2 also enhanced EOS adhesion to rh-intracellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) but not to rh-VCAM-1. Finally, H2O2 enhanced the expression of both CD11b and CD18 on EOS. These results indicate that H2O2 directly augments the adhesive property of EOS through beta2 integrin.

3013973|t|Molecular heterogeneity in chronic granulomatous disease: a human model of defective phagocyte superoxide production.
3013973|a|Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a genetically transmitted disorder thought to result from defect(s) in the activation or turnover of the NADPH dependent O2- generating oxidase enzyme system of human neutrophils and monocytes. The normal oxidase may be a flavoprotein-cytochrome b559 complex; therefore, these components of the oxidase were quantitated in the neutrophils from patients and family members of two unrelated CGD kindreds. The male propositus from an X-linked recessive kindred had a neutrophil oxidase fraction with low FAD content (26 pmol/mg protein) and undetectable cytochrome b559 (less than 5 pmol/mg protein). The male propositus from an autosomal recessive kindred had a neutrophil oxidase fraction with low FAD content (34 pmol FAD/mg protein), but normal cytochrome b559 content (170 pmol cytochrome b559/mg protein). Both parents of this latter CGD patient had normal FAD and cytochrome b559 content in their neutrophil oxidase fraction. We conclude that the carrier state in certain X-linked recessive female carriers of CGD can be detected by partial deficiencies of both flavoprotein and cytochrome b559 components of the oxidase, whereas presumed heterozygous carriers of certain autosomal recessive CGD kindreds cannot be detected by this means.

18567894|t|FSHB promoter polymorphism within evolutionary conserved element is associated with serum FSH level in men.
18567894|a|BACKGROUND: No polymorphisms affecting serum FSH levels have been described in the human FSHB gene. We have identified a potential regulatory single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, rs10835638; G/T) 211 bp upstream from the FSHB mRNA transcription start-site, located within a highly conserved region among placental mammals. We aimed to determine the correlation of carrier status of rs10835638 alternative alleles with serum FSH level in men, and testicular and hormonal parameters. METHODS: A quantitative genetic association study using a cohort of healthy men (n = 554; age 19.2 +/- 1.7 years) visiting the Centre of Andrology, Tartu University Hospital, Estonia. RESULTS: Rs10835638 (allele frequencies: G 87.6%, T 12.4%) was significantly associated with serum FSH level (analysis of variance: F = 13.0, P = 0.0016, df = 1; regression testing for a linear trend: P = 0.0003). Subjects with the GG genotype exhibited higher FSH levels (3.37 +/- 1.79 IU/l, n = 423) compared with heterozygotes (2.84 +/- 1.54 IU/l, n = 125) (P = 0.0005), the group of T-allele carriers (GT+TT, 2.78 +/- 1.51 IU/l, n = 131) (P = 0.0005) and TT-homozygotes (2.02 +/- 0.81 IU/L, n = 6) (P = 0.031). Rs10835638 was also associated with significant (P < 0.05) reduction in free testosterone index and testes volume, but increased semen volume, sex hormone-binding globulin, serum testosterone and estradiol. LH and inhibin-B levels did not differ significantly between groups. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of a regulatory SNP in FSHB promoter paves the way to study the effect of constitutively low FSH on male health and fertility. As FSH contributes to follicular development and sex steroid production in women, the role of this FSHB variant in female reproductive success is still to be addressed.

25280787|t|Nitric oxide plays a dual role in the oxidative injury of cultured rat microglia but not astroglia.
25280787|a|Nitric oxide (NO) and oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation are two important factors that lead to the progression of human neurological diseases. NO can be detrimental or protective to neurons under oxidative toxicity; however, in the case of brain exposure to oxidative stress, in addition to neurons, the existence of glia may also be disturbed by toxic ROS. The influence NO will have on ROS-mediated glial injury remains unclear. Here, we examined the effects of NO on cell viability under oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in rat primary mixed glia cultures, as well as pure astroglia and microglia cultures. We found that in mixed glia cultures, both H2O2 and NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-d,l-penicillamine (SNAP) elicited cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. Combinations of H2O2 and SNAP at sublytic concentrations were sufficient to damage mixed glia, and sublytic concentrations of SNAP could reduce the insults that resulted from toxic H2O2. Furthermore, in microglia or astroglia, sublytic concentrations of H2O2 were toxic when combined with SNAP, and the potency was increased with an increased SNAP concentration. In microglia but not astroglia, a toxic H2O2-induced apoptotic injury was attenuated by a sublytic level of SNAP. H2O2 at toxic levels activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and p53 pathways and increased DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in microglia, whereas the rescue exerted by sublytic SNAP against toxic H2O2 occurred via the activation of both Akt and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascades and decreased DNA DSBs. Moreover, a sublytic concentration of SNAP induced both heat shock protein 70 and heme oxygenase-1, which may be involved in decreasing the susceptibility of microglia to H2O2 toxicity. These results suggest that NO exhibits a concentration-dependent dual action of weakening or enhancing oxidative injury in mixed glia, particularly microglia.

23954680|a|The endogenous deposition of protein aggregates with fibrillar morphology is known to govern the genesis of several neurodisorders. The investigation of naturally occurring small molecules which can restrict the fibrillation process can help in the design of rational therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases. We report the inhibition of HSA fibrillation in the presence of naturally occurring sugars such as glucose, fructose, ribose and sucrose with fructose being the most potent. We have characterized the inhibitory potency of the sugars, using different spectroscopic and microscopic techniques.

19740767|t|Evidence for large diversity in the human transcriptome created by Alu RNA editing.
19740767|a|Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing alters the original genomic content of the human transcriptome and is essential for maintenance of normal life in mammals. A-to-I editing in Alu repeats is abundant in the human genome, with many thousands of expressed Alu sequences undergoing editing. Little is known so far about the contribution of Alu editing to transcriptome complexity. Transcripts derived from a single edited Alu sequence can be edited in multiple sites, and thus could theoretically generate a large number of different transcripts. Here we explored whether the combinatorial potential nature of edited Alu sequences is actually fulfilled in the human transcriptome. We analyzed datasets of editing sites and performed an analysis of a detailed transcript set of one edited Alu sequence. We found that editing appears at many more sites than detected by earlier genomic screens. To a large extent, editing of different sites within the same transcript is only weakly correlated. Thus, rather than finding a few versions of each transcript, a large number of edited variants arise, resulting in immense transcript diversity that eclipses alternative splicing as mechanism of transcriptome diversity, although with less impact on the proteome.

16946714|t|Oxidative stress via hydrogen peroxide affects proopiomelanocortin peptides directly in the epidermis of patients with vitiligo.
16946714|a|The human skin holds the capacity for autocrine processing of the proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived peptides. Recent data demonstrated the presence and functionality of ACTH, alpha- and beta-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), and beta-endorphin in the regulation of skin pigmentation, and a role has been put forward for alpha-MSH as an effective antioxidant. In patients with vitiligo, decreased epidermal POMC processing and low alpha-MSH levels were documented previously. These patients accumulate hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the 10(-3) M range in their epidermis. Therefore, we examined the involvement of H2O2 on POMC-derived peptides as possible targets for oxidation by this reactive oxygen species. To address this, we employed immunofluorescence labelling, dot blot analysis, Fourier transform Raman spectroscopy, functionality studies, and computer simulation of the peptide structures. We demonstrate H2O2-mediated oxidation of epidermal ACTH, alpha-MSH, and beta-endorphin in vitiligo owing to oxidation of methionine residues in the sequences of these peptides. Moreover, we show that oxidized beta-endorphin loses its function in the promotion of pigmentation in melanocytes. These changes are reversible upon the reduction of H2O2 levels by a pseudocatalase PC-KUS. Moreover, oxidation of alpha-MSH can be prevented by the formation of a 1:1 complex with the abundant cofactor (6R)-L-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin. Thus, using vitiligo, we demonstrate that H2O2 can affect pigmentation via epidermal POMC peptide redox homeostasis.

20302854|t|Mycophenolic acid inhibits the phosphorylation of NF-kappaB and JNKs and causes a decrease in IL-8 release in H2O2-treated human renal proximal tubular cells.
20302854|a|Ischaemia-reperfusion injury is a common occurrence in renal transplantation and may affect the long-term survival of the allograft. Oxidative stress may play a crucial role in this, with reactive oxygen species formed during reperfusion causing direct cellular damage as well as activating pro-inflammatory pathways. A human proximal tubule cell line (HK-2) was subjected to hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) stress that resulted in phosphorylation of c-jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) and the transcription factor NF-kappaB at Ser276, both of which have been associated with inflammation. Interleukin (IL)-8 production also increased upon H(2)O(2) stimulation. Pre-incubation of the cells with mycophenolic acid (MPA) resulted in reduced phosphorylation of both JNKs and NF-kappaB, and reduced IL-8 release in H(2)O(2)-stimulated HK-2 cells. MPA also reduced the H(2)O(2)-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinase, the extracellular-signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), Akt kinase and the transcription factor CREB (cyclic AMP response element binding protein). In rat kidneys subjected to ischaemia-reperfusion, an increase in both pJNK1/2 and pNF-kappaB was observed, which was reduced in kidneys obtained from mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)-treated rats. These results suggest that MPA may inhibit pro-inflammatory responses in the kidney by inhibiting activation of pro-inflammatory molecules in both the kidney and human renal proximal tubular cells subjected to oxidative stress.

15737440|t|Rat choline acetyltransferase of the peripheral type differs from that of the common type in intracellular translocation.
15737440|a|Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the synthesizing enzyme for acetylcholine, has been implicated to involve multiple isoforms of ChAT mRNA in several animals. Since these isoforms are mostly non-coding splice variants, only a homologous ChAT protein of about 68 kDa has been shown to be produced in vivo. Recent evidence indicates the existence of a protein coding splice variant of ChAT mRNA, which lacks exons 6-9 of the rat ChAT gene. The encoded protein was designated ChAT of a peripheral type (pChAT), because of its preferential expression in the peripheral nervous system as confirmed by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. However, functional significance of pChAT is unknown. To obtain a clue to this question, we examined a possible difference in intracellular trafficking between pChAT and the well-known ChAT of the common type (cChAT) using green fluorescent protein (GFP) in living human embryonic kidney cells. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that pChAT-GFP was detectable in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus, whereas cChAT-GFP was found in both cytoplasm and nucleus. Following treatment with leptomycin B, a nuclear export pathway inhibitor, pChAT-GFP became detectable in both cytoplasm and nucleus, indicating that pChAT can be translocated to the nucleus. In contrast, the leptomycin B treatment did not seem to affect the content of intranuclear cChAT-GFP. After incubation with protein kinase C inhibitors, enhanced accumulation of pChAT-GFP but not cChAT-GFP occurred in the nucleus. These results clearly indicate that pChAT varies from cChAT in intracellular transportation, probably reflecting the difference in physiological roles between pChAT and cChAT.

27349509|t|Taxonomic and functional diversity of cultured seed associated microbes of the cucurbit family.
27349509|a|BACKGROUND: Endophytes are microbes that colonize plant internal tissues without causing disease. In particular, seed-associated endophytes may be vectors for founder microbes that establish the plant microbiome, which may subsequently contribute beneficial functions to their host plants including nutrient acquisition and promotion of plant growth. The Cucurbitaceae family of gourds (e.g., cucumbers, melons, pumpkin, squash), including its fruits and seeds, is widely consumed by humans. However, there is limited data concerning the taxonomy and functions of seed-associated endophytes across the Cucurbitaceae family. Here, bacteria from surface-sterilized seeds of 21 curcurbit varieties belonging to seven economically important species were cultured, classified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and subjected to eight in vitro functional tests. RESULTS: In total, 169 unique seed-associated bacterial strains were cultured from selected cucurbit seeds. Interestingly, nearly all strains belonged to only two phyla (Firmicutes, Proteobacteria) and only one class within each phyla (Bacilli, γ-proteobacteria, respectively). Bacillus constituted 50 % of all strains and spanned all tested cucurbit species. Paenibacillus was the next most common genus, while strains of Enterobacteriaceae and lactic acid bacteria were also cultured. Phylogenetic trees showed limited taxonomic clustering of strains by host species. Surprisingly, 33 % of strains produced the plant hormone, indole-3-acetic acid (auxin), known to stimulate the growth of fruits/gourds and nutrient-acquiring roots. The next most common nutrient acquisition traits in vitro were (in rank order): nitrogen fixation/N-scavenging, phosphate solubilisation, siderophore secretion, and production of ACC deaminase. Secretion of extracellular enzymes required for nutrient acquisition, endophyte colonization and/or community establishment were observed. Bacillus strains had the potential to contribute all tested functional traits to their hosts. CONCLUSION: The seeds of economically important cucurbits tested in this study have a culturable core microbiota consisting of Bacillus species with potential to contribute diverse nutrient acquisition and growth promotion activities to their hosts. These microbes may lead to novel seed inoculants to assist sustainable food production. Given that cucurbit seeds are consumed by traditional societies as a source of tryptophan, the precursor for auxin, we discuss the possibility that human selection inadvertently facilitated auxin-mediated increases in gourd size.

16084674|t|Biochemical characterization and membrane fluidity of membranous vesicles isolated from boar seminal plasma.
16084674|a|Mammalian seminal plasma contains membranous vesicles (MV), which differ in composition and origin. Among these particles, human prostasomes and equine prostasome-like MV have been the most studied. The aim of the present work is to characterize the biochemical composition and membrane fluidity of MV isolated from boar seminal plasma. The MV from boar seminal plasma were isolated by ultracentrifugation and further purification by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. The MV were examined by electron microscopy (EM), amount of cholesterol, total phospholipid, protein content, and phospholipid composition were analyzed. Membrane fluidity of MV and spermatozoa were estimated from the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra of the 5-doxilstearic acid incorporated into the vesicle membranes by the order parameter (S). The S parameter gives a measure of degree of structural order in the membrane and is defined as the ratio of the spectral anisotropy in the membranes to the maximum anisotropy obtained in a rigidly oriented system. The S parameter takes into consideration that S = 1 for a rapid spin-label motion of about only one axis and S = 0 for a rapid isotropic motion. Intermediate S values between S = 0 and S = 1 represents the consequence of decreased membrane fluidity. The EM revealed the presence of bilaminar and multilaminar electron-dense vesicles. Cholesterol to phospholipid molar ratio from the isolated MV was 1.8. Phospholipid composition showed a predominance of sphingomyelin. The S parameter for porcine MV and for boar spermatozoa was 0.73 +/- 0.02 and 0.644 +/- 0.008, respectively, with the S for MV being greater (p < 0.001) than the S for spermatozoa. The high order for S found for boar MV was in agreement with the greater cholesterol/phospholipids ratio and the lesser ratio for phosphatidylcholine/sphingomyelin. Results obtained in the present work indicate that MV isolated from boar semen share many biochemical and morphological characteristics with equine prostasome-like MV and human prostasomes. The characteristics of the porcine MV of the seminal plasma, however, differed from those of boar sperm plasma membranes.

7581009|t|Effect of inhibitors on the transport of dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione in human erythrocytes.
7581009|a|Effect of inhibitors on and pH dependence of the export of dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione (DNP-SG), a glutathione S-conjugate formed upon in vivo conjugation of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene to glutathione, was studied in intact human erythrocytes. The transport was inhibited by orthovanadate (IC50 = 80 microM) and fluoride (IC50 = 9 nM). Erythrocyte anion exchange (Band 3) protein inhibitors DIDS and SITS did not exert any significant effect on the transport. The transport rate increased with increasing extracellular pH in the range of 6.0-8.0. The Arrhenius activation energy of the process was 72.4 +/- 1.3 kJ/mol. Membrane potential, extracellular sodium/potassium concentration ratio and extracellular osmolality in the range 300-600 mOsm did not influence the export rate.

24157722|t|Yeast cells with impaired drug resistance accumulate glycerol and glucose.
24157722|a|Multiple drug resistance (MDR) in yeast is effected by two major superfamilies of membrane transporters: the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) and the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily. In the present work, we investigated the cellular responses to disruptions in both MFS (by deleting the transporter gene, QDR3) and ABC (by deleting the gene for the Pdr3 transcription factor) transporter systems by growing diploid homozygous deletion yeast strains in glucose- or ammonium-limited continuous cultures. The transcriptome and the metabolome profiles of these strains, as well as the flux distributions in the optimal solution space, reveal novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of action of QDR3 and PDR3. Our results show how cells rearrange their metabolism to cope with the problems that arise from the loss of these drug-resistance genes, which likely evolved to combat chemical attack from bacterial or fungal competitors. This is achieved through the accumulation of intracellular glucose, glycerol, and inorganic phosphate, as well as by repurposing genes that are known to function in other parts of metabolism in order to minimise the effects of toxic compounds.

23568753|t|Continuous production of high-purity fructooligosaccharides and ethanol by immobilized Aspergillus japonicus and Pichia heimii.
23568753|a|High-purity fructooligosaccharides (FOS) were produced from sucrose by an innovative process incorporating immobilized Aspergillus japonicus and Pichia heimii cells. Intracellular FTase of A. japonicus converted sucrose into FOS and glucose, and P. heimii fermented glucose mainly into ethanol. The continuous production of FOS was carried out using a tanks-in-series bioreactor consisting of three stirred tanks. When a solution composed of 1 g L(-1) yeast extract and 300 g L(-1) sucrose was fed continuously to the bioreactor at a dilution rate of 0.1 h(-1), FOS at a purity of up to 98.2 % could be achieved and the value-added byproduct ethanol at 79.6 g L(-1) was also obtained. One gram of sucrose yielded 0.62 g FOS and 0.27 g ethanol. This immobilized dual-cell system was effective for continuous production of high-purity FOS and ethanol for as long as 10 days.

2621624|t|Respiratory responses to sustained isometric muscle contractions in man: the effect of muscle mass.
2621624|a|1. Respiratory responses to sustained isometric contractions of a small mass of muscle (the finger flexors) during handgripping, and of a larger mass of muscle (the quadriceps) during extension of the leg at the knee, have been studied in man. 2. For both masses of muscle the increases of ventilation and of oxygen consumption were greater for contractions at 40% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) than for contractions at 20% MVC. 3. The increase of ventilation was not related to the mass of muscle involved. 4. At 20% MVC oxygen consumption during contraction of the quadriceps was greater than that during handgripping. At 40% MVC the oxygen consumptions were similar. The oxygen debts following both handgrip and knee extensor contractions at 20% MVC were negligible. Following 40% MVC contractions of the quadriceps a significant oxygen debt was recorded but no debt was apparent following 40% MVC contractions of the finger flexors. 5. The increases of ventilation during isometric exercise were generally inappropriately high for the increases of gas exchange. This led to reductions of the end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure (PET,CO2), especially towards the end of exercise. 6. Following 40% MVC handgripping hyperventilation continued despite the reduced alveolar PCO2. By contrast, following 40% MVC knee extension PET,CO2 transiently rose above the resting level, but did not stimulate ventilation. 7. It appears that following fatiguing isometric contractions hyperventilation continues and appears to be independent of alveolar PCO2. It is suggested that stimuli which increase ventilation during exercise may continue to act during the early phase of recovery.

12039699|t|Agonistic and antagonistic properties of progesterone metabolites at the human mineralocorticoid receptor.
12039699|a|OBJECTIVE: Progesterone binds to the human mineralocorticoid receptor (hMR) with nearly the same affinity as do aldosterone and cortisol, but confers only low agonistic activity. It is still unclear how aldosterone can act as a mineralocorticoid in situations with high progesterone concentrations, e.g. pregnancy. One mechanism could be conversion of progesterone to inactive compounds in hMR target tissues. DESIGN: We analyzed the agonist and antagonist activities of 16 progesterone metabolites by their binding characteristics for hMR as well as functional studies assessing transactivation. METHODS: We studied binding affinity using hMR expressed in a T7-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. We used co-transfection of an hMR expression vector together with a luciferase reporter gene in CV-1 cells to investigate agonistic and antagonistic properties. RESULTS: Progesterone and 11beta-OH-progesterone (11beta-OH-P) showed a slightly higher binding affinity than cortisol, deoxycorticosterone and aldosterone. 20alpha-dihydro(DH)-P, 5alpha-DH-P and 17alpha-OH-P had a 3- to 10-fold lower binding potency. All other progesterone metabolites showed a weak affinity for hMR. 20alpha-DH-P exhibited the strongest agonistic potency among the metabolites tested, reaching 11.5% of aldosterone transactivation. The agonistic activity of 11beta-OH-P, 11alpha-OH-P and 17alpha-OH-P was 9, 5.1 and 4.1% respectively. At a concentration of 100 nmol/l, progesterone, 17alpha-OH-P and 20alpha-DH-P inhibit nearly 75, 40 and 35% of the transactivation by aldosterone respectively. All other progesterone metabolites tested demonstrate weaker affinity, and agonistic and antagonistic potency. CONCLUSIONS: The binding affinity for hMR and the agonistic and antagonistic activity diminish with increasing reduction of the progesterone molecule at C20, C17 and at ring A. We assume that progesterone metabolism to these compounds is a possible protective mechanism for hMR. 17alpha-OH-P is a strong hMR antagonist and could exacerbate mineralocorticoid deficiency in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

2554092|t|Receptors for and bioresponses to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in a human colon carcinoma cell line (HT-29).
2554092|a|Human colon carcinoma (HT-29) cells were examined for their capacity to bind and respond to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1,25-(OH)2D3]. These cells are known to differentiate and increase their population doubling time when galactose is substituted for glucose in their media. High-affinity and specific binding of 1,25-(OH)2[3H]D3 was observed in extracts of these cells grown in glucose. The binder sedimented in sucrose gradients and eluted from DEAE-cellulose columns in a manner indistinguishable from rabbit intestinal 1,25-(OH)2D3-receptor. Smaller amounts of this binder were seen in HT-29 cells grown in galactose. Both glucose-fed and galactose-fed cells exhibited a dose-dependent decrease in growth rate on exposure to 10(-12) to 10(-6) mol/L 1,25-(OH)2D3. Ultrastructural examination of galactose-fed and glucose + 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated cells showed enterocytic differentiation and features that were not distinguishable between these groups. Sucrase activity was higher in galactose-fed cells and did not change with 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment. However, the lower sucrase activity in glucose-fed cells increased after exposure to 10(-8) mol/L 1,25-(OH)2D3. These results indicate receptor content and bioresponsivity to 1,25-(OH)2D3 in a human enterocytic cell line, suggesting that it will be a useful model for the study of the mechanisms of action of this sterol.

27216435|t|Phospholipid: diacylglycerol acyltransferase contributes to the conversion of membrane lipids into triacylglycerol in Myrmecia incisa during the nitrogen starvation stress.
27216435|a|In addition to the Kennedy pathway for de novo biosynthesis, triacylglycerol (TAG), the most important stock for microalgae-based biodiesel production, can be synthesized by phospholipid: diacylglycerol acyltransferase (PDAT) that transfers an acyl group from phospholipids (PLs) to diacylglycerol (DAG). This study presents a novel gene that encodes PDAT from the green microalga Myrmecia incisa Reisigl H4301 (designated MiPDAT ). MiPDAT is localized on the plasma membrane (PM) via the agroinfiltration of tobacco leaves with a green fluorescent protein-fused construct. MiPDAT synthesizes TAG based on functional complementary experiments in the mutant yeast strain H1246 and the membrane lipid phosphatidylcholine (PC) is preferentially used as substrates as revealed by in vitro enzyme activity assay. The gradually increased transcription levels of MiPDAT in M. incisa during the cultivation under nitrogen starvation conditions is proposed to be responsible for the decrease and increase of the PC and TAG levels, respectively, as detected by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry after 4 d of nitrogen starvation. In addition, the mechanism by which MiPDAT in this microalga uses PC to yield TAG is discussed. Accordingly, it is concluded that this PM-located PDAT contributes to the conversion of membrane lipids into TAG in M. incisa during the nitrogen starvation stress.

10494845|t|Sugars as signal molecules in plant seed development.
10494845|a|Higher plants as sessile organisms react very flexible to environmental changes and stresses and use metabolites like glucose, sucrose and nitrate not only as nutrients but also as signals as part of their life strategies. The role of metabolites as signal molecules has attracted considerable interest during recent years. Data reviewed here for developing plant seeds suggest a trigger function of especially sugars also in development in that metabolic regulatory control can override developmental regulation, i.e., the developmental programme only continues normally if a certain metabolic state is sensed at a given time point in a given cell or tissue. Several experimental strategies have provided mainly correlative evidence that certain sugar levels and/or the resulting changes in osmotic values are necessary within defined tissues or cells to maintain a distinct stage of differentiation or to proceed with the developmental programme. In young legume seeds, but certainly also in other tissues, a high hexose (probably mainly glucose) level seems to maintain the capacity of cells to divide whereas - later in seed development - a certain sucrose level is necessary to induce storage-associated cell differentiation. A major determinant of embryo hexose levels in young legume seeds is an apoplastic invertase preferentially expressed in the inner cell layers of the seed coat. The enzyme cleaves the incoming photoassimilate sucrose into glucose and fructose. During development the tissue harbouring the invertase is degraded in a very specific spatial and temporal pattern as part of the developmental programme and is thus creating steep glucose gradients within the cotyledons. These gradients can be measured at nearly cellular resolution and were found to be correlated positively with cell division rate and negatively with cell differentiation and storage activities. A hexose and a sucrose transporter accumulating only in the epidermal cell layer of the cotyledons seem to be essential in creating and maintaining these gradients. To gain further insights into the role of metabolites, especially sugars, as triggers of developmental processes we foremost have to identify receptor molecules already characterised in yeast, and to describe and understand the signal transduction networks involved.

19462963|t|Analytical approaches toward successful human cell metabolome studies by NMR spectroscopy.
19462963|a|The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of cell handling and storage on cell integrity and (1)H high resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS) NMR spectra. Three different cell types have been considered (lung tumoral, amniocytes, and MG-63 osteosarcoma cells) in order for sample-dependent effects to be identified. Cell integrity of fresh cells and cells frozen in cryopreservative solution was approximately 70-80%, with the former showing higher membrane degradation, probably enzymatic, as indicated by increased phosphocholine (PC) and/or glycerophosphocholine (GPC). Unprotected freezing (either gradual or snap-freezing) was found to lyse cells completely, similar to mechanical cell lysis. Besides enhanced metabolites visibility, lysed cells showed a different lipid profile compared to intact cells, with increased choline, PC, and GPC and decreased phosphatidylcholine (PTC). Cell lysis has, therefore, a significant effect on cell lipid composition, making handling reproducibility an important issue in lipid analysis. Sample spinning was found to disrupt 5-25% of cells, depending on cell type, and HRMAS was shown to be preferable to solution-state NMR of suspensions or supernatant, giving enhanced information on lipids and comparable resolution for smaller metabolites. Relaxation- and diffusion-edited NMR experiments gave limited information on intact cells, compared to lysed cells. The (1)H HRMAS spectra of the three cell types are compared and discussed.

26432026|t|Combined exposure to nano-silica and lead induced potentiation of oxidative stress and DNA damage in human lung epithelial cells.
26432026|a|Growing evidence has confirmed that exposure to ambient particulate matters (PM) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. Ambient PM is a complex mixture of particles and air pollutants. Harmful effects of PM are specifically associated with ultrafine particles (UFPs) that can adsorb high concentrations of toxic air pollutants and are easily inhaled into the lungs. However, combined effects of UFPs and air pollutants on human health remain unclear. In the present study, we elucidated the combined toxicity of silica nanoparticles (nano-SiO2), a typical UFP, and lead acetate (Pb), a typical air pollutant. Lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells were exposed to nano-SiO2 and Pb alone or their combination, and their combined toxicity was investigated by focusing on cellular oxidative stress and DNA damage. Factorial analyses were performed to determine the potential interactions between nano-SiO2 and Pb. Our results showed that exposure of A549 cells to a modest cytotoxic concentration of Pb alone induced oxidative stress, as evidenced by elevated reactive oxygen species generation and lipid peroxidation, and reduced glutathione content and superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities. In addition, exposure of A549 cells to Pb alone induced DNA damage, as evaluated by alkaline comet assay. Exposure of A549 cells to non-cytotoxic concentration of nano-SiO2 did not induce cellular oxidative stress and DNA damage. However, exposure to the combination of nano-SiO2 and Pb potentiated oxidative stress and DNA damage in A549 cells. Factorial analyses indicated that the potentiation of combined toxicity of nano-SiO2 and Pb was induced by additive or synergistic interactions.

3801971|t|Variability in the effect of alcohol on alcohol metabolizing enzymes may determine relative sensitivity to alcohols: a new hypothesis.
3801971|a|Individual and racial differences in response to alcohol and with respect to alcoholism have strong genetic predispositions. Most studies on the actual genetic determinants have concentrated on the isozymes of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), the two enzymes of the primary pathway of alcohol metabolism. Although few "activity" variants (associated with mutations in the structural genes) of the two enzymes are known to exist in susceptible groups, these observations do not offer an adequate explanation for the observed variability in response to alcohols in the population. Some recent studies have reported alterations in the specific activity of the two enzymes following exposure to alcohol for different lengths of time in man, rat, and mice. The induction-repression so observed is hypothesized to be regulated by one or more inducibility genetic elements (IGE) associated with the structural loci of the two enzymes. Variability in IGE will permit a genotype (individual) specific response in ADH and ALDH specific activity when challenged with a given level of alcohol. Considering the relative toxicity of acetaldehyde, the primary metabolite of this pathway, the resistant individuals would be expected to show ALDH induction. Conversely, the susceptible individuals should respond to alcohol by ALDH repression. The ability of an individual to show induction or repression following alcohol ingestion will depend on his or her IGE genotype(s) associated with specific enzyme loci. Also, the degree of polymorphism at these loci would be expected to be extensive and yet population and race specific. Once experimentally established, this approach could have important implications in screening, counselling, prevention, and in novel approaches to treatment.

29146232|t|Parathyroidectomy in patients with chronic kidney disease: Impacts of different techniques on the biochemical and clinical evolution of secondary hyperparathyroidism.
29146232|a|BACKGROUND: Parathyroidectomy (PTx) decreases the mortality rate of refractory secondary hyperparathyroidism (rSHP) due to chronic kidney disease. A consensus regarding which techniques of PTx are associated with better outcomes is not available. The aims of this study are to evaluate the clinical and laboratory evolution of 49 hemodialysis patients with rSHP who underwent PTx using different techniques. METHODS: ) and were followed for 12 months. We analyzed the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), calcium-sensing receptor (CasR), vitamin D receptor (VDR), fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1), sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter-1 (PIT1), and Klotho in parathyroid glands. RESULTS: Baseline median serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels were 1,466 (1,087-2,125) pg/mL; vascular calcification scores correlated with serum iPTH (r = 0.529; P = .002) and serum phosphate levels (r = 0.389; P = .028); and Klotho expression was negatively correlated with serum phosphate levels (r = -0.4; P = .01). After 12 months, serum iPTH and alkaline phosphatase levels were significantly controlled in all groups, as was bone pain. The proportions of patients with serum iPTH levels within the ranges recommended by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes were similar among the treatment groups. During the hungry bone disease (HBS), patients received 3,786 g (1,412-7,580) of elemental calcium, and a trend toward a positive correlation between the cumulative calcium load at the end of follow up and VC score post-PTx was noted (r = 0.390; P = .06). Two cases evolved to clinically uncontrolled hyperparathyroidism in the sub-PTx group. The expression patterns of PCNA, VDR, CasR, PIT1, FGFR1, and Klotho in parathyroid glands did not correlate with serum systemic iPTH levels or the duration of HBS. CONCLUSIONS: All 3 operative techniques were effective at controlling rSHP, both in clinical and laboratory terms. Neither the quantity nor quality of parathyroid fragments influenced serum systemic iPTH and AT-iPTH levels. The cumulative calcium load appeared to correlate with the VC score and may have affected its progression. The effects of phosphate restriction on Klotho expression in human parathyroid glands and the subsequent decrease in FGF23 resistance must be addressed in further studies.

12496360|t|Role of reactive oxygen species in cells overexpressing manganese superoxide dismutase: mechanism for induction of radioresistance.
12496360|a|Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide anions (O(2)(-)) into hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). We altered the intracellular status of reactive oxygen species by introducing human MnSOD cDNA into the human ovarian cancer cell line SK-OV-3. The overexpression of MnSOD inhibited cell growth and induced a concomitant increase in the level of H(2)O(2) in SK-OV-3 cells. The cells overexpressing MnSOD were more resistant to irradiation than parental cells. MnSOD overexpression shortened the G(2)-M duration in irradiated cells. Either inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) or scavenging free radicals blocked the induction of radioresistance by MnSOD and also abolished the shortening of the G(2)-M duration with concomitant inhibition of p38MAPK phosphorylation. Irradiation increased the generation of H(2)O(2) even more in these transfectants. These results suggest that the accumulated H(2)O(2) potentiated the activation of p38MAPK after irradiation in cells overexpressing MnSOD, which led to the protection of cells from irradiation-mediated cell death through the G(2)-M checkpoint. SK-OV-3 cells had no constitutive expression of p53, and the overexpression of MnSOD and/or irradiation did not induce p53 or p21(WAF1), which causes cell cycle arrest. Thus, our results suggest that MnSOD alters the cell cycle progression of irradiated cells independently of p53 and p21(WAF1).

25699522|t|Cell-based screening identifies the active ingredients from Traditional Chinese Medicine formula Shixiao San as the inhibitors of atherosclerotic endothelial dysfunction.
25699522|a|In this study, we performed a phenotypic screening in human endothelial cells exposed to oxidized low density lipoprotein (an in vitro model of atherosclerotic endothelial dysfunction) to identify the effective compounds in Shixiao San. After investigating the suitability and reliability of the cell-based screening method using atorvastatin as the positive control drug, this method was applied in screening Shixiao San and its extracts. The treatment of n-butanol fraction on endothelial cells exhibited stronger healing effects against oxidized low density lipoprotein-induced insult when compared with other fractions. Cell viability, the level of nitric oxide, endothelial nitric oxide synthase and endothelin-1 were measured, respectively. The assays revealed n-butanol fraction significantly elevated the survival ratio of impaired cells in culture. In parallel, n-butanol fraction exhibited the highest inhibition of inflammation. The generation of prostaglandin-2 and adhesion molecule (soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1) was obviously declined. Furthermore, n-butanol fraction suppressed the production of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde, and restored the activity of superoxide dismutase. Compounds identification of the n-butanol fraction was carried out by ultra high liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry. The active ingredients including quercetin-3-O-(2G-α-l-rhamnosyl)-rutinoside, quercetin-3-O-neohesperidoside, isorhamnetin-3-O-neohesperidoside and isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside revealed the ability of anti-atherosclerosis after exposing on endothelial cells. The current work illustrated the pharmacology effect of Shixiao San and clearly indicated the major active components in Shixiao San. More importantly, the proposed cell-based screening method might be particularly suitable for fast evaluating the anti-atherosclerosis efficacy of Traditional Chinese Medicines and screening out the interesting ingredients of Traditional Chinese Medicines.

3258534|t|Characterization of plasma membranes from A431 cells, isolated by self-generating Percoll gradient: a rapid isolation procedure to obtain plasma membranes with functional epidermal growth factor receptors.
3258534|a|Plasma membranes have been isolated from the human epidermoid carcinoma cell line A431 by a rapid fractionation of lysate on Percoll density gradient at pH 9.6. Endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes and mitochondria sedimented at the bottom of gradient whereas plasma membranes focused at low density, as shown with specific markers. Plasma membranes displayed a 4.5- and 4.4-fold enrichment in [3H]concanavalin A and 5'-nucleotidase, respectively. This proteic fraction was further characterized by its lipid composition and phospholipid analysis. The cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio was 0.45 in plasma membranes against 0.19 in lysate. Sphingomyelin increased from 7.5% of total phospholipids in lysate to 16.2% in plasma membranes, as well as phosphatidylserine which displayed a 1.5-fold enrichment in the plasma membrane fraction. This was at the expense of phosphatidylcholine (45.2% in lysate, against 35% in plasma membranes). Electron microscopy of the isolated material showed vesicles essentially free from endoplasmic reticulum and organelles. These plasma membranes retained the ability to bind 125I-labelled epidermal growth factor (125I-EGF) with a Kd = 4.7 nM and Bmax = 63 pmol/mg protein. EGF binding resulted in a stimulation of the phosphorylation protein reaction in the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels of phosphorylated proteins indicated that the radioactivity of the major band of molecular weight 170,000 was clearly enhanced by EGF binding. These results indicate that the EGF receptor and its intrinsic protein kinase activity were preserved during our plasma membrane isolation procedure.

18094428|a|PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of the three different forms of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase [i.e., manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), copper zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), and extracellular superoxide dismutase (EcSOD)] on the malignant phenotype of human pancreatic cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Human pancreatic cancer cell lines were infected with adenoviral vectors containing the cDNAs for three different forms of the antioxidant enzyme SOD. Intratumoral injections of the adenoviral vectors were used in nude mice with human tumor xenografts. RESULTS: Increases in immunoreactive protein and enzymatic activity were seen after infections with the AdMnSOD, AdCuZnSOD, or AdEcSOD constructs. Increased SOD activity decreased superoxide levels and increased hydrogen peroxide levels. Increasing SOD levels correlated with increased doubling time. Cell growth and plating efficiency decreased with increasing amounts of the adenoviral constructs, with the AdCuZnSOD vector having the greatest effect in decreasing in vitro tumor growth. In contrast, inhibiting endogenous SOD with small interfering RNA increased superoxide levels and promoted tumor growth. Of the three SODs, tumors grew the slowest and survival was increased the greatest in nude mice injected with the AdEcSOD construct. CONCLUSIONS: Scavenging plasma membrane-generated superoxide may prove beneficial for suppression of pancreatic cancer growth.

9511801|t|Laser-based spectroscopic methods in tissue characterization.
9511801|a|Laser-based spectroscopic techniques were developed for tumor tissue characterization utilizing different tumor-localizing substances. In particular, sensitization with the heme precursor delta-amino levulinic acid (ALA) administered topically, orally or intravenously was used for the induction of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). The autofluorescence as well as the PpIX-related fluorescence signals were monitored, and tumor demarcation functions were calculated for different human malignant tumors, such as tumors in the urinary bladder and the prostatic gland, in the head and neck region, in the breast and in the gastrointestinal tract. In the gastrointestinal tract, colon tumors were examined as well as tumors and dysplastic lesions in the esophagus, where patients with Barrett's esophagus were examined. Time-integrated laser-induced fluorescence measurements utilizing a point monitoring fluorosensor and a multicolor fluorescence imaging system were performed in vivo in patients in different clinical specialities.

11692274|t|The effects of inhibiting Rho-associated kinase with Y-27632 on force and intracellular calcium in human myometrium.
11692274|a|Recent work has indicated that smooth muscle force production may be influenced by pathways not dependent upon the Ca2+-calmodulin phosphorylation of light chains. Few studies, however, have examined the importance of these pathways in intact muscles that contract phasically rather than tonically. Therefore, to determine whether the Ca2+-independent Rho-A and associated kinase (ROK) pathway can affect contractions of the intact human myometrium, we used Y-27632 to inhibit ROK. Three types of contractile activity were examined: spontaneous and those elicited by oxytocin and by depolarisation by high K+. Y-27632 decreased force significantly under all three conditions, without changing intracellular [Ca2+]. However, the effects on force were only large when the uterus was producing force tonically rather than phasically. This suggests that the Rho-A-ROK pathway may not be a potent modulator of force in the human myometrium under physiological conditions.

2681329|t|The role of dietary electrolytes in hypertension.
2681329|a|The possible contribution of dietary electrolyte intake as a cause of or contributor to the development of hypertension has been intensively investigated for over 50 years. Evidence from various sources suggests a role for sodium-salt, chloride, calcium, and magnesium. In this article, we will review the evidence supporting a role for each of these electrolytes in human hypertension.

2419119|t|Study of cholesterol side-chain cleavage (20,22 desmolase) deficiency causing congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia using bovine-sequence P450scc oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes.
2419119|a|Conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone is mediated by the cholesterol side-chain cleavage (SCC) enzyme, P450scc. Deficient SCC activity causes congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia (also known as 20,22 desmolase deficiency), a potentially lethal defect in the synthesis of all steroid hormones. To probe for possible genetic defects causing this disease we synthesized four oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing 63 to 72 bases corresponding to portions of the bovine complementary DNA (cDNA) sequence for P450scc. The bovine oligonucleotides were labeled and used directly to probe Southern blots of normal human genomic DNA, revealing a pattern indicating there is a single P450scc gene in the human genome. Hybridization to Northern blots of normal human and bovine adrenal messenger RNA indicates that P450scc messenger RNA is about 2.0 kilobases long in both species. Hybridizations of the oligonucleotides to genomic DNA from three unrelated patients with SCC deficiency did not detect a deletion in the human P450scc gene. The bovine sequence oligonucleotides were then used to isolate a human P450scc cDNA clone. The isolated P450scc cDNA fragment contains 818 bases encoding 239 amino acids of the protein, the translation termination signal, and 98 bases of the 3' untranslated region. The sequence of this carboxy-terminal half of the human P450scc protein is 72% homologous with the bovine sequence and contains an additional amino acid not found in bovine P450scc; the human and bovine nucleotide sequences are 81% homologous. Repetition of the genomic DNA blotting studies with the cDNA probe gave the same results obtained with the bovine-sequence oligonucleotide probes, confirming that SCC deficiency is not due to a deletion in the regions of the P450scc hybridizing with the probes. Long, chemically synthesized heterologous sequence oligonucleotides containing unknown numbers of base mismatches with human sequences may thus be used to study human genes so that access to a cDNA is not necessary for such studies.

17220918|t|Effect of Volume Loading with Water, Normal Saline, Palm Wine and Lipton Tea on Urinary Output, pH, Specific Gravity, Sodium and Potassium Concentrations in Human Subjects.
17220918|a|A comparative study of the diuretic effect of water, normal saline, palm wine and Lipton tea was carried out on forty (40) randomly selected, apparently normal undergraduate students of Medicine and Pharmacy at the University of Uyo, Nigeria. One and a half (1.5) litres of water, normal saline, palm wine and Lipton tea were given on separate days to the same subjects. The subjects were made to void their bladder before ingesting these substances and the urine sample collected was taken as control sample at the time zero. Thereafter, all the subjects emptied their bladder hourly for 3 hours. The urinary output, pH, specific gravity, sodium and potassium concentrations were determined. The results showed that water, palm wine and Lipton tea produced diuresis. Normal saline did not. Reduction of specific gravity and pH of urine accompanied these diuretic effects. Administration of normal saline and Lipton tea caused natriuresis. Potassium sparing diuresis was seen with Lipton tea and palm wine, whereas, water diuresis led to increased levels of potassium in urine. Volume loading with the above substances affected not only urinary output but also renal handling of sodium and potassium ions.

3169258|t|Chloride mediated inhibition of the phosphate and the sulfate transport by dipyridamole in human erythrocyte ghosts.
3169258|a|The inhibition of the unidirectional phosphate and sulfate flux in human erythrocyte ghosts by dipyridamole has been investigated. The inhibition of the phosphate and the sulfate flux is mediated by chloride. At zero chloride, dipyridamole was found to be completely ineffective. At 10 mM chloride, dipyridamole acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor of the phosphate and the sulfate flux and elicits an up to 95% inhibition of the phosphate and the sulfate transport. The results of our studies provide strong evidence for a cooperative binding of chloride and of dipyridamole to the non-protonated form of the band 3 membrane domain.

17513442|t|The pharmacodynamics of L-arginine.
17513442|a|L-arginine is a precursor for nitric oxide (NO) synthesis. NO is a ubiquitous mediator that is formed by a family of enzymes named NO synthases. In the brain, NO acts as a neurotransmitter; in the immune system, NO acts as a mediator of host defense; and in the cardiovascular system, NO mediates the protective effects of the intact endothelium, acting as a vasodilator and endogenous antiatherogenic molecule. About 5 g of L-arginine is ingested each day in a normal Western diet. L-arginine plasma levels are not significantly reduced in most disease conditions, except end-stage renal failure during hemodialysis treatment. Nonetheless, intravenous or dietary (oral) administration of relatively large doses of L-arginine has been shown to result in enhanced NO formation in subjects with impaired endothelial function at baseline. In several controlled clinical trials, long-term administration of L-arginine has been shown to improve the symptoms of cardiovascular disease. However, in other trials L-arginine was not beneficial, and in a recent study, the authors reported higher mortality of subjects receiving L-arginine than those receiving placebo. Recently it became clear that endogenous levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), a competitive inhibitor of L-arginine metabolism by NO synthase, may determine a subject's response to L-arginine supplementation. L-arginine appears to exert no effect in subjects with low ADMA levels, whereas in subjects with high ADMA levels, L-arginine restores the L-arginine/ADMA ratio to normal levels and thereby normalizes endothelial function. In conclusion, the effects of L-arginine supplementation on human physiology appear to be multicausal and dose-related. Doses of 3-8 g/d appear to be safe and not to cause acute pharmacologic effects in humans.

21306437|t|Effects of thermal discomfort in an office on perceived air quality, SBS symptoms, physiological responses, and human performance.
21306437|a|UNLABELLED: The effects of thermal discomfort on health and human performance were investigated in an office, in an attempt to elucidate the physiological mechanisms involved. Twelve subjects (six men and six women) performed neurobehavioral tests and tasks typical of office work while thermally neutral (at 22°C) and while warm (at 30°C). Multiple physiological measurements and subjective assessment were made. The results show that when the subjects felt warm, they assessed the air quality to be worse, reported increased intensity of many sick building syndrome symptoms, expressed more negative mood, and were less willing to exert effort. Task performance decreased when the subjects felt warm. Their heart rate, respiratory ventilation, and end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide increased significantly, and their arterial oxygen saturation decreased. Tear film quality was found to be significantly reduced at the higher temperature when they felt warm. No effects were observed on salivary biomarkers (alpha-amylase and cortisol). The present results imply that the negative effects on health and performance that occur when people feel thermally warm at raised temperatures are caused by physiological mechanisms. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: This study indicates to what extent elevated temperatures and thermal discomfort because of warmth result in negative effects on health and performance and shows that these could be caused by physiological responses to warmth, not by the distraction of subjective discomfort. This implies that they will occur independently of discomfort, i.e. even if subjects have become adaptively habituated to subjective discomfort. The findings make it possible to estimate the negative economic consequences of reducing energy use in buildings in cases where this results in elevated indoor temperatures. They show clearly that thermal discomfort because of raised temperatures should be avoided in workplaces.

1332881|t|Deletion of subunit 9 of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytochrome bc1 complex specifically impairs electron transfer at the ubiquinol oxidase site (center P) in the bc1 complex.
1332881|a|Deletion of QCR9, the nuclear gene encoding subunit 9 of the mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, results in inactivation of the bc1 complex and inability of the yeast to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources. The loss of bc1 complex activity is due to loss of electron transfer activity at the ubiquinol oxidase site (center P) in the complex. Electron transfer at the ubiquinone reductase site (center N), is unaffected by the loss of subunit 9, but the extent of cytochrome b reduction is diminished. This is the first instance in which a supernumerary polypeptide, lacking a redox prosthetic group, has been shown to be required for an electron transfer reaction within the cytochrome bc1 complex.

27558234|t|Nox4 contributes to the hypoxia-mediated regulation of actin cytoskeleton in cerebrovascular smooth muscle.
27558234|a|UNLABELLED: Ischemia/reperfusion and the resulting oxidative/nitrative stress impair cerebral myogenic tone via actin depolymerization. While it is known that NADPH oxidase (Nox) family is a major source of vascular oxidative stress; the extent and mechanisms by which Nox activation contributes to actin depolymerization, and equally important, the relative role of Nox isoforms in this response is not clear. AIM: To determine the role of Nox4 in hypoxia-mediated actin depolymerization and myogenic-tone impairment in cerebral vascular smooth muscle. MAIN METHODS: Control and Nox4 deficient (siRNA knock-down) human brain vascular smooth muscle cells (HBVSMC) were exposed to 30-min hypoxia/45-min reoxygenation. Nox2, Nox4, inducible and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (iNOS and nNOS) and nitrotyrosine levels as well as F:G actin were determined. Myogenic-tone was measured using pressurized arteriography in middle cerebral artery isolated from rats subjected to sham, 30-min ischemia/45-min reperfusion or ex-vivo oxygen glucose deprivation in the presence and absence of Nox inhibitors. RESULTS: Nox4 and iNOS expression were significantly upregulated following hypoxia or ischemia/reperfusion. Hypoxia augmented nitrotyrosine levels while reducing F actin. These effects were nullified by inhibiting nitration with epicatechin or pharmacological or molecular inhibition of Nox4. Ischemia/reperfusion impaired myogenic-tone, which was restored by the selective inhibition of Nox4. CONCLUSION: Nox4 activation in VSMCs contributes to actin depolymerization after hypoxia, which could be the underlying mechanism for myogenic-tone impairment following ischemia/reperfusion.

19025611|t|Cytoplasmic CXCR4 expression in breast cancer: induction by nitric oxide and correlation with lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis.
19025611|a|BACKGROUND: Lymph nodes constitute the first site of metastasis for most malignancies, and the extent of lymph node involvement is a major criterion for evaluating patient prognosis. The CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) has been shown to play an important role in lymph node metastasis. Nitric oxide (NO) may also contribute to induction of metastatic ability in human cancers. METHODS: CXCR4 expression was analyzed in primary human breast carcinoma with long-term follow-up. The relationship between nitrotyrosine levels (a biomarker for peroxynitrate formation from NO in vivo) and lymph node status, CXCR4 immunoreactivity, and other established clinico-pathological parameters, as well as prognosis, was analyzed. Nitrite/nitrate levels and CXCR4 expressions were assessed in MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3 breast cancer cell lines after induction and/or inhibition of NO synthesis. RESULTS: CXCR4 staining was predominantly cytoplasmic; this was observed in 50%(56/113) of the tumors. Cytoplasmic CXCR4 expression was significantly correlated with nitrotyrosine levels and lymph node metastasis. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that cytoplasmic CXCR4 expression was associated with reduced disease-free and overall survival. In multivariate analysis, cytoplasmic CXCR4 expression emerged as a significant independent predictor for overall and disease-free survival. Cytoplasmic expression of functional CXCR4 in MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3 cells was increased by treatment with the NO donor DETA NONOate. This increase was abolished by L-NAME, an inhibitor of NOS. CONCLUSION: Our data showed a role for NO in stimulating cytoplasmic CXCR4 expression in vitro. Formation of the biomarker nitrotyrosine was also correlated with CXCR4 expression and lymph node metastasis in vivo. In addition, cytoplasmic CXCR4 expression may serve as a significant prognostic factor for long-term survival in breast cancer.

8738134|t|Characterization of an L-type calcium channel expressed by human retinal Müller (glial) cells.
8738134|a|The traditional notion that glial cells are permeable only to potassium has been revised. For example, glia from various parts of the nervous system have calcium-permeable ion channels. Since characterization of the calcium channels in glia is limited, the purpose of this study was to determine the molecular identity and examine the functional properties of a voltage-gated calcium channel expressed by Müller cells, the predominant glia of the retina. Whole-cell and perforated-patch recordings of human Müller cells in culture revealed a high threshold voltage-activated calcium current that is blocked by dihydropyridines, but not by omega-conotoxin GVIA or omega-conotoxin MVIIC. RT-PCR of cultured human Müller cells using primers specific for the calcium channel subunits demonstrated the expression of an L-type channel composed of the alpha 1D, alpha 2 and beta 3 subunits. The alpha 2 subunit of the Müller cell calcium channel is a splice variant which is distinct from either the skeletal muscle alpha 2s or the brain alpha 2b. Our electrophysiological experiments indicate that the alpha 1D/alpha 2/beta 3 calcium channel is functionally linked with the activation of a potassium channel that may serve as one of the pathways for the redistribution by Müller cells of excess retinal potassium.

11266592|t|Differentiation of the slow-binding mechanism for magnesium ion activation and zinc ion inhibition of human placental alkaline phosphatase.
11266592|a|The binding mechanism of Mg(2+) at the M3 site of human placental alkaline phosphatase was found to be a slow-binding process with a low binding affinity (K(Mg(app.)) = 3.32 mM). Quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of the Mg(2+)-free and Mg(2+)-containing enzymes by acrylamide showed almost identical dynamic quenching constant (K(sv) = 4.44 +/- 0.09 M(-1)), indicating that there is no gross conformational difference between the M3-free and the M3-Mg(2+) enzymes. However, Zn(2+) was found to have a high affinity with the M3 site (K(Zn(app.)) = 0.11 mM) and was observed as a time-dependent inhibitor of the enzyme. The dependence of the observed transition rate from higher activity to lower activity (k(obs)) at different zinc concentrations resulted in a hyperbolic curve suggesting that zinc ion induces a slow conformational change of the enzyme, which locks the enzyme in a conformation (M3'-Zn) having an extremely high affinity for the Zn(2+) (K*(Zn(app.)) = 0.33 microM). The conformation of the M3'-Zn enzyme, however, is unfavorable for the catalysis by the enzyme. Both Mg(2+) activation and Zn(2+) inhibition of the enzyme are reversible processes. Structural information indicates that the M3 site, which is octahedrally coordinated to Mg(2+), has been converted to a distorted tetrahedral coordination when zinc ion substitutes for magnesium ion at the M3 site. This conformation of the enzyme has a small dynamic quenching constant for acrylamide (K(sv) = 3.86 +/- 0.04 M(-1)), suggesting a conformational change. Both Mg(2+) and phosphate prevent the enzyme from reaching this inactive structure. GTP plays an important role in reactivating the Zn-inhibited enzyme activity. We propose that, under physiological conditions, magnesium ion may play an important modulatory role in the cell for protecting the enzyme by retaining a favorable geometry of the active site needed for catalysis.

15204767|t|Exhaled ethanol and acetaldehyde in human subjects exposed to low levels of ethanol.
15204767|a|With the increased use of ethanol-blend gasoline as an alternative to gasoline, there is a demand for new data to assess the potential health risk of ethanol exposure. Currently, there is very limited information from the scientific database on the adverse effects of inhaled low doses of ethanol (ETOH). The aim of this study was to determine the concentration of ETOH and acetaldehyde (ACTDH), a toxic metabolite of ETOH, in the alveolar air (AA) of subjects exposed to low ETOH vapor concentrations by inhalation. Five healthy adults (2 women, 3 men), nonsmoking, 25-55 yr of age, were exposed for 6 consecutive hours to 25, 100, or 1000 ppm ETOH and were asked to provide AA samples at various intervals during and after each exposure session, for ETOH and ACTDH measurements. Results showed that the concentrations of ACTDH and ETOH in AA measured after 2 h of exposure at 25 ppm were 0.06 ppm and 7.5 ppm, respectively. Overall, there was a significant correlation between ETOH exposure and ETOH (R(2) =.92, p <.001) and ACTDH (R(2) =.99, p <.001) in AA. The ratios between ACTDH and ETOH in AA after 4 h of exposure to 25.9 ppm, 101.7 ppm, and 990.8 ppm ETOH were 0.005, 0.008, and 0.006, respectively. In conclusion, this study showed that inhalation of ETOH at low concentrations resulted in measurable levels of ACTDH in AA and suggests that ACTDH may be used, with good toxicological relevance, as an indicator of exposure to low levels of ETOH in air.

10985969|t|Implication of ATP and sodium in arachidonic acid incorporation by placental syncytiotrophoblast brush border and basal plasma membranes in the human.
10985969|a|The human placental syncytiotrophoblast is the main site of exchange of nutrients and minerals between the mother and her fetus. In order to characterize the placental transport of some fatty acids, we studied the incorporation of arachidonic acid, a fetal primordial fatty acid, in purified bipolar syncytiotrophoblast brush border (BBM) and basal plasma membranes (BPM) from human placenta. The basal arachidonic acid incorporation in BBM and BPM was time dependent and reached maximal values of 0.75+/-0.10 and 0.48+/-0.18 pmol/mg protein, respectively, after 2.5 min. The presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (3 m m) increases significantly the maximal incorporation of arachidonic acid by sixfold (4.75+/-0.35 pmol/mg) and ninefold (4.40+/-0.84 pmol/mg) in BBM and BPM, respectively. Moreover, an increase in the arachidonic acid incorporation was also obtained in the presence of sodium where the values achieved 7.68+/-0.98 (10x) and 6.53 pmol/mg (13.6x) for BBM and BPM, respectively. We also showed that the combination of both Na(+)and ATP increases significantly the maximal incorporation of arachidonic acid in BPM to 7.89+/-0.15 pmol/mg protein, while in BBM it did not modify its incorporation (8.18+/-0.25 pmol/mg protein), as compared to the presence of sodium alone. Our results demonstrate that arachidonic acid is incorporated by both placental syncytiotrophoblast membranes, and is ATP and sodium-linked. However, different mechanisms seem to be involved in this fatty acid incorporation through BBM and BPM, since the presence of Na(+)or ATP increased it, while the association of these two elements increased it only in BPM. We also demonstrated by osmolarity experiments that both membranes bind arachidonic acid, potentially involving one or more fatty acids binding proteins.

7314156|a|The effects of 4-hydroxy-4-androstene-3, 17-dione (4-OH-A) and 10-propargylestr-4-ene-3, 17-dione (PED) on the aromatization of androstenedione (A) and the conversion of A to testosterone (T) were studied in incubations with breast carcinoma and breast adipose tissues. Parallel studies were carried out to determine the effects of 4-OH-A and PED on A metabolism in tissue from 5 patients with breast carcinoma. At 11 micro M, both compounds fully inhibited aromatization, whereas the conversion of A to T was decreased in only 2 incubations. Studies with varying concentrations of 4-OH-A and PED demonstrated that both compounds inhibited estrone (E1) formation by 80% at a concentration of 0.085 micro M, with maximum effect at 0.34 micro M. 90% inhibition of estradiol (E2) formation was observed at inhibitor concentrations of 0.17 micro M or greater. T formation was slightly affected at 0.67 microM, but was progressively inhibited with increasing 4-OH-A or PED concentrations, reaching 70% at 11 micro M. Similar experiments with 4-OH-A in breast adipose tissue homogenates showed that a concentration of 0.1 micro M was sufficient to inhibit aromatization while T inhibition required 11 micro M. 4-OH-A and PED are selective inhibitors of aromatization in human breast tissues and may provide a mechanism for controlling estrogen responsive processes.

17524547|t|The Saccharomyces cerevisiae ADP/ATP carrier-iso 1 cytochrome c fusion protein: one-step purification and functional analysis in vitro.
17524547|a|Genetic expression versus plasmidic overexpression of a functional recombinant fusion protein combining the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier (Anc2p) and the iso-1-cytochrome c (Cyc1p) has been investigated, with the main aim of increasing the polar surface of the carrier to improve its crystallization properties. The gene encoding the his6-tagged fusion protein was expressed in yeast under the control of the regulatory sequences of ScANC2 or under the control of the strong yeast PMA1 promoter. In both cases, the chimeric carrier, Anc2-Cyc1(His6)p, was able to restore growth on a non-fermentable carbon source of a yeast strain devoid of functional ADP/ATP carrier, demonstrating its transport activity. Nevertheless, when the expression vector was used, the level of expression of Anc2-Cyc1(His6)p was no greater than that of the chimeric carrier obtained in yeast mitochondria after homologous recombination. Optimal conditions to extract and to purify Anc2-Cyc1(His6)p were determined. A series of detergents was screened for their ability to extract and to preserve in vitro the chimeric carrier. A rapid, single step purification of Anc2-Cyc1(His6)p was developed, using n-dodecyl-beta-d-maltoside (DoDM) as the best detergent to solubilize the chimeric protein. Carboxyatractyloside- (CATR-) and nucleotide-binding sites were preserved in the purified protein. Moreover, the Cyc1p moiety of Anc2-Cyc1(His6)p-CATR complex solubilized in DoDM was still able to interact in vitro with the cytochrome c oxidase (COX), with the same affinity as yeast Cyc1p. Improved production and purification of Anc2-Cyc1(His6)p-CATR complex opens up new possibilities for the use of this protein in crystallographic approaches to the yeast ADP/ATP carrier. Furthermore, Anc2-Cyc1(His6)p may be an useful molecular tool to investigate in vivo interactions between components of the respiratory chain complexes such as COX and the proteins implicated in ATP biogenesis, such as the ATP/ADP carrier.

19406012|t|GC determination of acetone, acetaldehyde, ethanol, and methanol in biological matrices and cell culture.
19406012|a|A gas chromatography with flame ionization detection method (GC-FID) with direct injection, using a capillary column, was validated to determine ethanol, acetaldehyde, methanol, and acetone in different human matrices, such as whole blood, vitreous humour, and urine, with clinical and forensic interest. This method was also employed to quantify these compounds in cell culture medium, thus being useful in basic research. A good peak resolution was achieved, with linear correlation between concentration and peak areas for all the compounds in all the matrices. The inter- and intra-day precisions of the method were always under 15% and 10%, respectively. The accuracy of the method, calculated as the percentage of the target concentration, was within the acceptable limits. The obtained limits of detection were below 0.85 mg/L for acetaldehyde and below 0.75 mg/L for the other considered compounds. The small injection volume and the high split ratios applied, allied to the high performance of the GC column, resulted in very good peak resolution and high sensitivities. This method is easy to perform, making it suitable for the routine of clinical biochemistry and forensic laboratories.

11283221|t|Receptor-mediated control of regulatory volume decrease (RVD) and apoptotic volume decrease (AVD).
11283221|a|A fundamental property of animal cells is the ability to regulate their own cell volume. Even under hypotonic stress imposed by either decreased extracellular or increased intracellular osmolarity, the cells can re-adjust their volume after transient osmotic swelling by a mechanism known as regulatory volume decrease (RVD). In most cell types, RVD is accomplished mainly by KCl efflux induced by parallel activation of K+ and Cl- channels. We have studied the molecular mechanism of RVD in a human epithelial cell line (Intestine 407). Osmotic swelling results in a significant increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and thereby activates intermediate-conductance Ca2+-dependent K+ (IK) channels. Osmotic swelling also induces ATP release from the cells to the extracellular compartment. Released ATP stimulates purinergic ATP (P2Y2) receptors, thereby inducing phospholipase C-mediated Ca2+ mobilization. Thus, RVD is facilitated by stimulation of P2Y2 receptors due to augmentation of IK channels. In contrast, stimulation of another G protein-coupled Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaR) enhances the activity of volume-sensitive outwardly rectifying Cl- channels, thereby facilitating RVD. Therefore, it is possible that Ca2+ efflux stimulated by swelling-induced and P2Y2 receptor-mediated intracellular Ca2+ mobilization activates the CaR, thereby secondarily upregulating the volume-regulatory Cl- conductance. On the other hand, the initial process towards apoptotic cell death is coupled to normotonic cell shrinkage, called apoptotic volume decrease (AVD). Stimulation of death receptors, such as TNF receptor and Fas, induces AVD and thereafter biochemical apoptotic events in human lymphoid (U937), human epithelial (HeLa), mouse neuroblastoma x rat glioma hybrid (NG108-15) and rat phaeochromocytoma (PC12) cells. In those cells exhibiting AVD, facilitation of RVD is always observed. Both AVD induction and RVD facilitation as well as succeeding apoptotic events can be abolished by prior treatment with a blocker of volume-regulatory K+ or Cl- channels, suggesting that AVD is caused by normotonic activation of ion channels that are normally involved in RVD under hypotonic conditions. Therefore, it is likely that G protein-coupled receptors involved in RVD regulation and death receptors triggering AVD may share common downstream signals which should give us key clues to the detailed mechanisms of volume regulation and survival of animal cells. In this Topical Review, we look at the physiological ionic mechanisms of cell volume regulation and cell death-associated volume changes from the facet of receptor-mediated cellular processes.

8987816|t|Human alpha4beta2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in HEK 293 cells: A patch-clamp study.
8987816|a|The cloning and expression of genes encoding for the human neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) has opened new possibilities for investigating their physiological and pharmacological properties. Cells (HEK 293) stably transfected with two of the major brain subunits, alpha4 and beta2, were characterized electrophysiologically using the patch-clamp technique. Fast application of the natural ligand ACh can evoke currents up to 3500 pA, with an apparent affinity (EC50) of 3 microM and a Hill coefficient of 1.2. The rank order of potency of four nAChR ligands to activate human alpha4beta2 receptors is (-)-nicotine > ACh > (-)-cytisine > ABT-418. At saturating concentrations, the efficacy of these ligands is ABT-418 >> (-)-nicotine > ACh >> (-)-cytisine > GTS-21 (previously named DMXB). Coapplication of 1 microM ACh with known nAChR inhibitors such as dihydro-beta-erythroidine and methyllycaconitine reversibly reduces the current evoked by the agonist with respective IC50 values of 80 nM and 1.5 microM. The current-voltage relationship of human alpha4beta2 displays a strong rectification at positive potentials. Experiments of ionic substitutions suggest that human alpha4beta2 nAChRs are permeable to sodium and potassium ions. In the "outside-out" configuration, ACh evokes unitary currents (main conductance 46 pS) characterized by a very fast rundown. Potentiation of the ACh-evoked currents is observed when the extracellular calcium concentration is increased from 0.2 to 2 mM. In contrast, however, a reduction of the evoked currents is observed when calcium concentration is elevated above 2 mM.

10584979|t|Omeprazole weakly inhibits CYP1A2 activity in man.
10584979|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Omeprazole is an inducer of human cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) enzymes, but shows inhibitory effects on CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In this study, a potential inhibitory effect of omeprazole on caffeine metabolism, a validated CYP1A2 marker, was examined. METHODS: A randomized, balanced crossover single-dose study was conducted in 16 healthy volunteers comprising 12 extensive (EM) and 4 poor metabolizers (PM) for CYP2C19. All volunteers received a 40 mg omeprazole dose or placebo 0.5 h prior to caffeine 3 mg/kg body weight. Six EMs were re-tested with 80 mg of omeprazole. In vitro, effects of omeprazole on caffeine N3-demethylation were determined in human liver microsomes. RESULTS: In vivo, non-parametric point estimates (90% confidence intervals) for the ratios of caffeine pharmacokinetics with/without co-administration of the 40 mg omeprazole dose were: AUC 1.08 (1.04 - 1.13), MRT 1.09 (0.99 - 1.19), and plasma ratio of paraxanthine/caffeine 6 h post-dose 0.91 (0.80 - 1.00). Inhibition of caffeine N3-demethylation by omeprazole was slightly more pronounced in PM than in EM of CYP2C19. Estimates for the 80 mg omeprazole dose were: AUC 1.12 (1.05 -1.18), MRT 1.18 (1.07 - 1.30), and paraxanthine/caffeine ratio 0.83 (0.74 -0.94). In vitro, omeprazole was mainly a competitive CYP1A2 inhibitor with K(i) values of around 150 microM. CONCLUSIONS: Omeprazole exerts a concentration-dependent inhibition of CYP1A2 activity in man. However, even after single oral doses up to 80 mg, this effect is weak and without clinical relevance.

19864616|t|The d5 dopamine receptor mediates large-conductance, calcium- and voltage-activated potassium channel activation in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells.
19864616|a|Large-conductance, calcium- and voltage-activated potassium (BK(Ca)) channels hyperpolarize coronary artery smooth muscle cells, causing vasorelaxation. Dopamine activates BK(Ca) channels by stimulating D(1)-like receptor-mediated increases in cAMP in porcine coronary artery myocytes. There are two D(1)-like receptors (R), D(1)R and D(5)R. We hypothesize that the specific D(1)-like receptor involved in BK(Ca) channel activation in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMCs) is the D(5)R and that activation occurs via cAMP cross-activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), rather than cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). The effects of D(1)-like receptor agonists and antagonists on BK(Ca) channel opening in HCASMCs were examined in the presence and absence of PKG/PKA inhibition by cell-attached patch clamp. In the absence of commercially available ligands specific for D(1)R or D(5)R, D(1)R or D(5)R protein was down-regulated by transfecting HCASMCs with human D(1)R or D(5)R antisense oligonucleotides, respectively: cells transfected with scrambled oligonucleotides and nontransfected HCASMCs served as controls. The predominant ion channel conducting outward currents in nontransfected HCASMCs was identified as the large-conductance, calcium- and voltage-activated potassium (BK(Ca)) channel, which was activated by D(1)-like receptor agonists despite PKA inhibition with (9R,10S,12S)-2,3,9,10,11,12-hexahydro-10-hydroxy-9-methyl-1-oxo-9,12-epoxy-1H-diindolo[1,2,3-fg:3',2',1'-kl]pyrrolo[3,4-i][1,6]benzodiazocine-10-carboxylic acid (KT 5720) (300 nM), but was abolished by inhibiting PKG with 9-methoxy-9-methoxycarbonyl-8-methyl-2,3,9,10-tetrahydro-8,11-epoxy-1H,8H,11H-2,7b-11a-triazadibenzo(a,g) cycloocta(cde)-trinden-1-one (KT 5823) (300 nM). D(1)-like receptor agonists activated BK(Ca) channels in all transfected cells except those transfected with D(5)R antisense oligonucleotides. Thus, the dopamine (D(1)-like) receptor mediates activation of BK(Ca) channels in HCASMCs by D(5)R, not D(1)R, and via PKG, not PKA. This is the first report of differential D(1)-like receptor regulation of vascular smooth muscle function in human cells.

15597328|t|Stimulation via Toll-like receptor 9 reduces Cryptococcus neoformans-induced pulmonary inflammation in an IL-12-dependent manner.
15597328|a|Cytosine-phosphate-guanosine-containing oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN) are important vaccine adjuvants that promote Th1-type immune responses. Cryptococcus neoformans is a serious human pathogen that replicates in the lung but may disseminate systemically leading to meningitis, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Immunization of susceptible C57BL/6 mice with CpG ODN deviates the immune response from a Th2- toward a Th1-type response following infection with C. neoformans. CpG also induces IL-12, TNF, MCP-1 and macrophage nitric oxide production. CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells producing IFN-gamma increase in frequency, while those producing IL-5 decrease. More importantly, pulmonary eosinophilia is significantly reduced, an effect that depends on IL-12 and CD8(+) T cells but not NK cells. CpG treatment also reduces the burden of C. neoformans in the lung, an effect that is IL-12-, NK cell- and T cell-independent and probably reflects a direct effect of CpG on pathogen opsonization or an enhancement of macrophage antimicrobial activity. An equivalent beneficial effect is also observed when CpG ODN treatment is delivered during established cryptococcal disease. This is the first study documenting that promotion of lung TLR9 signaling using synthetic agonists enhances host defense. Activation of innate immunity has clear therapeutic potential and may even be beneficial in patients with acquired immune deficiency.

6431003|t|Induction of crisis forms in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum by gamma-interferon-activated, monocyte-derived macrophages.
6431003|a|Previous investigations on the mechanism by which the host mounts an immune response against the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum have not resolved whether cell-mediated responses, in the absence of circulating anti-Plasmodial antibodies, can effect the destruction of the intraerythrocytic parasite. We report that the intraerythrocytic parasite P. falciparum is lethally susceptible to the imposition of oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent factor(s) released by interferon-gamma-activated, monocyte-derived human macrophages. In addition, trophozoite-schizont stage intraerythrocytic parasites were killed on exposure to small amounts of H2O2 generated in cell-free enzyme assays. Although parasiticidal activity was markedly enhanced by the addition of lactoperoxidase and KI, killing was abrogated by the addition of catalase. The ability of freshly isolated human monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), and lymphokine-activated MDM to kill or inhibit the growth and multiplication of the malaria parasites was assessed. Parasites were killed when exposed to monocytes or lymphokine-activated MDM, but not when exposed to nonactivated macrophages. The capacity to activate MDM for microbicidal activity was abrogated on neutralization of crude lymphokines or recombinant interferon-gamma with a monoclonal antibody prepared against interferon-gamma. The intraerythrocytic parasites surviving the cytotoxicity assay were inhibited in their development and appeared to be degenerating, a characteristic of "crisis" forms. Killing of P. falciparum correlated positively with the magnitude of the oxidative response, as evidenced by the reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium to formazan in the mononuclear phagocytes, and by the detection of secreted H2O2. Of particular interest was the observation that only the later developing stage of the intracellular parasite triggered the respiratory burst in the absence of antibody. A role for oxygen-independent parasiticidal factors was suggested by the finding that lymphokine-activated macrophages from a patient with chronic granulomatous disease were able to partially inhibit the growth of P. falciparum, although oxidative metabolism in these cells was impaired.

3676413|t|The roles of prolactin and testosterone in the development and function of granulosa lutein tissue in the rat.
3676413|a|The luteotropic roles of prolactin and testosterone (or estradiol formed in luteal tissue) were investigated in hypophysectomized rats with homografts of granulosa lutein tissue. Using this approach, we could determine the effects of prolactin independently of estrogen, since granulosa lutein tissue does not produce estrogen de novo under these conditions. Luteinizing granulosa cells were expressed from the ovaries of immature pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin-primed Fischer 344 rats 6 h after injection of human chorionic gonadotropin. The cells were transplanted beneath the kidney capsule of adult, hypophysectomized, ovariectomized Fischer 344 recipients, which were treated with hormones daily for 12 or 14 days. In rats without treatment (no hormones, n = 3) and in rats treated with only testosterone (Silastic capsule, n = 6), only small amounts of luteal tissue (less than 5 mg/rat) were found and serum progesterone remained at low concentrations (10 ng or less) throughout the experiment. In contrast, in rats treated either with ovine prolactin (300 micrograms/day, n = 10) or with the combination of prolactin and testosterone (n = 12), serum progesterone increased to 43 ng/ml by Day 8. Beyond Day 8, serum progesterone continued to rise in rats treated with the combination of prolactin and testosterone to reach a mean value of 87 ng/ml by Day 14, and mean homograft wet weight was 49 mg/rat; in rats treated with only prolactin, serum progesterone decreased to 25 ng/ml by Day 14 and homograft wet weight was lower (24 mg/rat). Prolactin and testosterone together stimulated more homograft aromatase activity in vivo than did prolactin alone, but the in vitro production of progesterone was not different.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

9892190|t|Malignant transformation alters membrane choline phospholipid metabolism of human mammary epithelial cells.
9892190|a|Transduction of mitogenic signals in cells can be mediated by molecules derived from the synthesis and breakdown of the major membrane phospholipid, phosphotidylcholine. Studies were performed on human mammary epithelial cells in culture to understand the impact of malignant transformation and progression on membrane phospholipid metabolism. In the model system used here, phosphocholine levels and total choline-containing phospholipid metabolite levels increased with progression from normal to immortalized to oncogene-transformed to tumor-derived cells. These changes occurred independently of cell doubling time. A "glycerophosphocholine to phosphocholine switch" was apparent with immortalization. This alteration in phenotype of increased phosphocholine relative to glycerophosphocholine was observed in oncogene-transformed and for all human breast tumor cell lines analyzed. The results demonstrate that progression of human mammary epithelial cells from normal to malignant phenotype is associated with altered membrane choline phospholipid metabolism.

8016125|t|Heterologous expression of plant vacuolar pyrophosphatase in yeast demonstrates sufficiency of the substrate-binding subunit for proton transport.
8016125|a|The membrane bounding the vacuole of plant cells contains two electrogenic proton pumps. These are the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (EC 3.6.1.3), an enzyme common to all eukaryotes, and a vacuolar H(+)-translocating pyrophosphatase (EC 3.6.1.1), which is ubiquitous in plants but otherwise known in only a few phototrophic bacteria. Although the substrate-binding subunit of the vacuolar H(+)-pyrophosphatase has been identified and purified and cDNAs encoding it have been isolated and characterized, the minimal unit competent in pyrophosphate (PPi)-energized H+ translocation is not known. Here we address this question and show that heterologous expression of the cDNA (AVP) encoding the substrate-binding subunit of the vacuolar H(+)-pyrophosphatase from the vascular plant Arabidopsis thaliana in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae results in the production of vacuolarly localized functional enzyme active in PPi-dependent H+ translocation. Since the heterologously expressed pump is indistinguishable from the native plant enzyme with respect to PPi hydrolysis, H+ translocation, activation by potassium, and selective inhibition by calcium and 1,1-diphosphonates, it is concluded that all of the known catalytic functions of the enzyme map to the one subunit encoded by AVP.

23261600|t|Discovery of an iron-regulated citrate synthase in Staphylococcus aureus.
23261600|a|Bacteria need to scavenge iron from their environment, and this is no less important for bacterial pathogens while attempting to survive in the mammalian host. One key strategy is the synthesis of small iron chelators known as siderophores. The study of siderophore biosynthesis systems over the past several years has shed light on novel enzymology and, as such, has identified new therapeutic targets. Staphylococcus aureus, a noted human and animal pathogen, produces two citrate-based siderophores, termed staphyloferrin A and staphyloferrin B. The iron-regulated gene cluster for the biosynthesis of staphyloferrin B, sbnA-I, contains several yet uncharacterized genes. Here, we report on the identification of an enzyme, SbnG, which is annotated in the genome sequence as a metal-dependent class II aldolase. In contrast to this prediction, we report that, instead, SbnG has evolved to catalyze metal-independent citrate synthase activity using oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA as substrates. We describe an in vitro assay to synthesize biologically active staphyloferrin B from purified enzymes and substrates, and identify several SbnG inhibitors, including metals such as calcium and magnesium.

22138475|t|Nerolidol effects on mitochondrial and cellular energetics.
22138475|a|In the present work, we evaluated the potential toxic effects of nerolidol, a sesquiterpenoid common in plants essential oils, both on mitochondrial and cellular energetics. Samples of enriched natural extracts of nerolidol (a racemic mixture of cis and trans isomers) were tested on rat liver mitochondria and a decrease in phosphorylative system was observed but not in the mitochondrial respiratory chain activity, which reflects a direct effect on F1-ATPase. Hence, respiratory control ratio was also decreased. Cellular ATP/ADP levels were significantly decreased in a concentration-dependent manner, possibly due to the direct effect of nerolidol on F(0)F(1)-ATPsynthase. Nerolidol stimulates respiratory activity probably due to an unspecific effect, since it does not show any protonophoric effect. Furthermore, we observed that mitochondrial permeability transition was delayed in the presence of nerolidol, possibly due to its antioxidant activity and because this compound decreases mitochondrial transmembrane electric potential. Our results also show that, in human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line (HepG2), nerolidol both induces cell death and arrests cell growth, probably related with the observed lower bioenergetic efficiency.

18751929|t|The novel cholinesterase-monoamine oxidase inhibitor and antioxidant, ladostigil, confers neuroprotection in neuroblastoma cells and aged rats.
18751929|a|The current therapeutic advance in which future drugs are designed to possess varied pharmacological properties and act on multiple targets has stimulated the development of the multimodal drug, ladostigil (TV3326; (N-propargyl-(3R) aminoindan-5yl)-ethyl methyl carbamate). Ladostigil combines neuroprotective effects with monoamine oxidase (MAO)-A and MAO-B and cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitory activities in a single molecule, as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body disease. In the present study, we demonstrate that ladostigil (10(-6)-10 muM) dose-dependently increased cell viability, associated with increased activity of catalase and glutathione reductase and decrease of intracellular reactive oxygen species production in a cytotoxic model of human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). In addition, ladostigil significantly upregulated mRNA levels of several antioxidant enzymes (catalase, NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 and peroxiredoxin 1) in both H(2)O(2)-treated SH-SY5Y cells, as well as in the high-density human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cultured apoptotic models. In vivo chronic treatment with ladostigil (1 mg/kg per os per day for 30 days) markedly upregulated mRNA expression levels of various enzymes involved in metabolism and oxidation processes in aged rat hippocampus. In addition to its unique combination of ChE and MAO enzyme inhibition, these results indicate that ladostigil displays neuroprotective activity against oxidative stress-induced cell apoptosis, which might be valuable for aging and age-associated neurodegenerative diseases.

2366816|t|The effect of paracetamol on oxidative damage in human peripheral lymphocytes.
2366816|a|Unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDSox) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) induced by non-enzymatic activation of molecular oxygen (Fe2+ +H2O2) were measured in human peripheral lymphocytes from healthy volunteers. The effect of paracetamol (PC) in a final concentration range of 0.05-10 mmole/l on these oxidative processes and on DNA repair induced by MNNG (UDSmut) was investigated. The level of induced LPO was measured by the thiobarbituric acid assay, UDSox and UDSmut were determined by scintillometric measurement of incorporated [methyl-3H]thymidine into damaged DNA. PC at concentrations lower than 1 mmole/l significantly potentiates the non-enzymatically induced LPO and UDSox with the maximum of the activation being around 0.1 mmole/l. In contrast, PC at concentrations higher than 1 mmole/l exhibits an inhibitory effect on both LPO and UDSox. On the other hand, concentrations higher than 1 mmole/l significantly suppressed DNA-repair synthesis induced by MNNG.

15010890|t|Dietary boron intake and prostate cancer risk.
15010890|a|Boron affects human steroid hormone levels. Circulating testosterone and estradiol levels have been proposed to modify prostate cancer risk. However, the association between dietary boron intake and the risk of prostate cancer has not been evaluated by any epidemiological study. We explored the association between dietary boron intake and the risk of prostate cancer in the USA. Our analysis was based on data from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). Cross-sectional case-control study design was employed by comparing boron intake of 95 prostate cancer cases with that of 8,720 male controls. After controlling for age, race, education, smoking, body mass index, dietary caloric intake, and alcohol consumption, increased dietary boron intake was associated with a decreased risk of prostate cancer with a dose-response pattern. The adjusted odds ratio was 0.46 (95% confidence interval: 0.21-0.98) for the highest quartile of boron intake comparing to the lowest quartile (P for trend = 0.0525). The observed association should be interpreted with caution because of the small case sample size and the nature of the cross-sectional study design, but deserve further investigation.

6788056|t|Effect of cimetidine on renal function in man.
6788056|a|1 Renal function was studied in nine patients with chronic peptic ulcer before and at repeated intervals during treatment with cimetidine (1.6g daily). 2 Plasma creatinine concentration was significantly increased on the first day after starting cimetidine, and at 3 weeks, but not at 12 weeks. Blood urea concentration was unchanged. 3. Clearances of creatinine 51Cr EDTA and 125I-hippuran were significantly reduced within 6 h of starting cimetidine. Clearances of 51Cr EDTA and 125I-hippuran returned to baseline within 3 weeks, and creatinine clearance within 12 weeks. 4 Urinary creatine excretion was significantly increased at 3 weeks, but there was no significant change in urinary creatinine excretion, or in serum creatine phosphokinase concentration. 5. These observations suggest that cimetidine causes an early but short-lived fall in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow. The later rise in plasma creatinine was unaccompanied by any change in GFR, and may have been due to competition by cimetidine for renal tubular handling. 6 Caution should be exercised when administering cimetidine to patients with pre-existing renal failure.

20382526|t|A novel lime pretreatment for subsequent bioethanol production from rice straw--calcium capturing by carbonation (CaCCO) process.
20382526|a|In order to establish an efficient bioethanol production system for rice straw, we developed a novel lime-pretreatment process (CaCCO process) that did not require a solid-liquid-separation step. This process adopted a step in which after pretreatment lime was neutralized by carbonation, resulting in a final pH of about 6. CaCO(3) produced by the process was kept in the reaction vessel, and no significant inhibitory effects on enzymatic saccharification and fermentation were observed. In the CaCCO process, solubilized carbohydrates, such as xylan, starch, and sucrose were also kept in the vessel, enabling high recoveries of monomeric sugars. Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) of pretreated rice straw, 10% (g-rice straw/g-water), using Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia stipitis yielded 19.1 g L(-1) ethanol that was 74% of the theoretical yield from glucose and xylose. Thus, this process represents a novel pretreatment method to utilize not only cellulose but also xylan, starch, and sucrose from biomass.

7736923|t|Metabolites of L-735,524, a potent HIV-1 protease inhibitor, in human urine.
7736923|a|L-735,524, N-[2(R)-hydroxy-1(S)-indanyl]-5-(2(S)-(1,1- dimethylethylaminocarbonyl)-4-[(pyridin-3-yl)methyl]piperazin++ +-1-yl)-4(S)- hydroxy-2(R)-phenylmethylpentanamide, is a potent and specific inhibitor of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease and is undergoing clinical evaluation. In an initial clinical study, noninfected male volunteers were administered single, 1000 mg oral doses of nonlabeled compound. Urine samples were collected over a period of 48 hr. Metabolic profile of the urine was determined by HPLC-UV comparison with that from a human liver slice incubation of radiolabeled L-735,524. Seven significant metabolites were isolated from pooled human urine, and were characterized by NMR, MS, and/or chromatographic comparisons with authentic standards. The major metabolic pathways were identified as: a) glucuronidation at the pyridine nitrogen to yield a quaternized ammonium conjugate, b) pyridine N-oxidation, c) para-hydroxylation of the phenylmethyl group, d) 3'-hydroxylation of the indan, and e) N-depyridomethylation. A minor product was identified as 2',3'-trans-dihydroxyindan analog. Urinary excretion of L-735,524 and its metabolites represented a minor pathway of elimination. The intact parent compound seemed to be the major component in the urine, whereas the level of each metabolite was relatively low.

16809411|t|Functional KCa3.1 K+ channels are required for human lung mast cell migration.
16809411|a|BACKGROUND: Mast cell recruitment and activation are critical for the initiation and progression of inflammation and fibrosis. Mast cells infiltrate specific structures in many diseased tissues such as the airway smooth muscle (ASM) in asthma. This microlocalisation of mast cells is likely to be key to disease pathogenesis. Human lung mast cells (HLMC) express the Ca2+ activated K+ channel K(Ca)3.1 which modulates mediator release, and is proposed to facilitate the retraction of the cell body during migration of several cell types. A study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that blockade of K(Ca)3.1 would attenuate HLMC proliferation and migration. METHODS: HLMC were isolated and purified from lung material resected for bronchial carcinoma. HLMC proliferation was assessed by cell counts at various time points following drug exposure. HLMC chemotaxis was assayed using standard Transwell chambers (8 microm pore size). Ion currents were measured using the single cell patch clamp technique. RESULTS: K(Ca)3.1 blockade with triarylmethane-34 (TRAM-34) did not inhibit HLMC proliferation and clotrimazole had cytotoxic effects. In contrast, HLMC migration towards the chemokine CXCL10, the chemoattractant stem cell factor, and the supernatants from tumour necrosis factor alpha stimulated asthmatic ASM was markedly inhibited with both the non-selective K(Ca)3.1 blocker charybdotoxin and the highly specific K(Ca)3.1 blocker TRAM-34 in a dose dependent manner. Although K(Ca)3.1 blockade inhibits HLMC migration, K(Ca)3.1 is not opened by the chemotactic stimulus, suggesting that it must be involved downstream of the initial receptor-ligand interactions. CONCLUSIONS: Since modulation of K(Ca)3.1 can inhibit HLMC chemotaxis to diverse chemoattractants, the use of K(Ca)3.1 blockers such as TRAM-34 could provide new therapeutic strategies for mast cell mediated diseases such as asthma.

22247602|t|Butyrate enhancement of inteleukin-1β production via activation of oxidative stress pathways in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated THP-1 cells.
22247602|a|In inflammatory bowel diseases, interleukin-1β production is accelerated. Butyrate, a short chain fatty acid, plays an important role in inflammatory bowel diseases. We investigated the effect of butyrate on interleukin-1β production in macrophage and elucidated its underlying mechanism. We stimulated THP-1 cells, a human premonocytic cell line, by lipopolysaccharide alone and by butyrate with lipopolysaccharide. Butyrate with lipopolysaccharide increased interleukin-1β production more than lipopolysaccharide alone. Butyrate with lipopolysaccharide increased caspase-1 activity more than lipopolysaccharide alone. As for the phosphorylation pathway, PD98059 (ERK1/2 inhibitor), SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor), SP600125 (JNK1/2 inhibitor) decreased caspase-1 activity and interleukin-1β production to approximately 50% of the controls. Pertussis toxin (G protein-coupled signal transduction pathway inhibitor) also reduced interleukin-1β production to approximately 50%. Butyrate with lipopolysaccharide increased reactive oxygen species levels more than lipopolysaccharide alone. The addition of N-acetyl L-cysteine reduced reactive oxygen species levels to a level similar to that of lipopolysaccharide alone. Butyrate with lipopolysaccharide increased nitric oxide production more than lipopolysaccharide alone, and the addition of N-acetyl L-cysteine reduced the elevated amount of nitric oxide. In conclusions, butyrate enhances interleukin-1β production by activating caspase-1, via reactive oxygen species, the phosphorylation of MAPK, and G protein mediated pathways in lipopolysaccharide stimulated THP-1 cells.

21782644|t|The use of xenobiotic-mediated methaemoglobin formation to assess the effects of thyroid hormones on diabetic and non-diabetic human erythrocytic oxidant defence mechanisms in vitro.
21782644|a|Diabetes is associated with an abnormal incidence of hypothyroidism, which exacerbates hyperglycaemia, so further damaging already compromised erythrocytic defence mechanisms. Methaemoglobin formation is a useful measure of the health of these mechanisms, as it determines the resistance of diabetic erythrocytes to sustained oxidative stress. The effect of l-tri-iodothyronine (T(3)) was, therefore, studied on nitrite and monoacetyldapsone hydroxylamine (MADDS-NHOH) mediated methaemoglobin formation in diabetic and non-diabetic human erythrocytes. Diabetic erythrocytes showed less sensitivity compared with non-diabetics to methaemoglobin formation mediated by both compounds. A 30 min pre-incubation with T(3) at 3 and 30 nM did not affect nitrite-mediated methaemoglobin formation compared with control observations in both cell types. In diabetic erythrocytes incubated with T(3) at 30 nM, there were significant increases in MADDS-NHOH-mediated methaemoglobin formation compared with control in both diabetic and non-diabetic cells. Studies comparing blood isolated from diabetic patients stabilised on thyroxine (T(4); 50 μG/day), T(4)-free diabetics and non-diabetics, showed that T(4) supplementation significantly increased MADDS-NHOH-mediated methaemoglobin formation compared with T(4)-free diabetic cells so that for two time points, T(4)-treated diabetic erythrocytic methaemoglobin formation was indistinguishable from that of non-diabetics. These studies indicate that T(4) supplementation improves some erythrocytic oxidant defence mechanisms in a time dependent manner.

3582465|t|Acute renal effects of oral felodipine in normal man.
3582465|a|The acute renal effects of a single oral dose of felodipine 0.15 mg/kg were studied in 8 healthy males. Thirty minutes after administration the mean plasma concentration was 25.7 nmol/l. There was a significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure (24%) and a concomitant rise in heart rate (38%), leaving the systolic pressure unchanged. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF) were measured by the constant infusion technique using the clearance of 125I-iothalamate and 131I-hippuran respectively. GFR was unchanged and the filtration fraction (FF) was reduced, whilst there was a decrease in renal vascular resistance (RVR). The glomerular filter characteristics were unchanged, as estimated by the unchanged excretion rate of albumin. There was a significant rise in the clearance of sodium (176%) but only a small and insignificant increase in urine volume. Clearance of potassium was decreased. An increase in the clearance of uric acid and a rise in the beta-2-microglobulin excretion rate were found, both suggesting a proximal tubular effect of felodipine. The excretion rate of calcium was increased.

23408806|t|Effect of transportation on fecal bacterial communities and fermentative activities in horses: impact of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-1077 supplementation.
23408806|a|This study evaluated the effect of transportation on fecal bacterial communities and activities in horses with or without supplementation of live yeast and attempted to link those effects with changes in blood stress markers. Four mature horses were assigned to a crossover design and fed a basal diet (60:40 forage to concentrate; 1.45% BW on a DM basis), with or without supplementation, of 2 × 10(10) cfu/d of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-1077. After a 14-d adaptation to dietary treatments, the 5-d experiment started 1 d before transportation (d -1). At d 0, horses were simultaneously transported in a truck for 2 h. Feces were sampled 4 h after the morning meal of concentrate at d -1, 0 (immediately after transportation), and 3 for enumeration of the main functional bacterial groups and determination of fermentative variables. Within each dietary treatment, feces were pooled before DNA extraction and molecular analysis of the bacterial communities, using temporal temperature gradient electrophoreses (TTGE). Blood samples were collected at the same time for determination of white blood cells (WBC) counts and glucose and total protein concentrations. Regardless of dietary treatment, the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio increased during transportation (P < 0.01), indicating that horses were stressed. In both treatments, TTGE profiles were clearly different before and 3 d after transportation, and the percentage of similarity between profiles at d -1 and 3 was greater in supplemented horses compared with the controls. From d 0 to 3, the molar percentage of propionate increased and total concentration of VFA and the acetate + butyrate to propionate ratio decreased, regardless of dietary treatment (P < 0.01, P = 0.02, and P < 0.01, respectively), whereas pH decreased only in control horses (P = 0.03). Regardless of day of sampling, fecal concentrations of lactate-utilizing bacteria and cellulolytic bacteria were greater in supplemented horses than in control horses (P = 0.04 and 0.08, respectively). Our results indicate that transportation for 2 h disturbed the fecal bacterial ecosystem in horses that could increase the risk of triggering microbial dysbiosis on a longer term in the equine large intestine. Supplementing Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-1077 could help reduce the negative impact of transportation on the fecal bacterial ecosystem.

23442442|t|L-Arginine enhances cell proliferation and reduces apoptosis in human endometrial RL95-2 cells.
23442442|a|BACKGROUND: L-arginine is considered to be one of the most versatile amino acids due to the fact that it serves as a precursor for many important molecules in cellular physiology. When supplemented in the diet, L-arginine can increase the number of implantation sites in mice and rats, suggesting an effect at the level of the endometrium. To this end, this study determined the effect that L-arginine has on apoptosis and cell proliferation in human endometrial RL95-2 cells. RESULTS: L-arginine at physiological (200 micromol/L) and supra-physiological (800 micromol/L) concentrations increased cell proliferation at days 2 and 4 post-treatment with a dose-dependent effect being observed on day 2. Additionally, inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthase and arginase, which are responsible for the conversion of L-arginine to NO and polyamines, respectively, reduced the proliferative effect of L-arginine. L-arginine also decreased the proportion of cells with TUNEL positive nuclei and increased the ratio of cells with healthy mitochondria compared to cells with a disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential, indicating that L-arginine prevents mitochondrial mediated apoptosis in endometrial RL95-2 cells. Furthermore, exposure to L-arginine did not affect total BAD protein expression; however, L-arginine increased the abundance of phosphorylated BAD protein. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, L-arginine added to the culture media at physiological (200 micromol/L) and supraphysiological concentrations (800 micromol/L) enhanced endometrial RL95-2 cell proliferation through mechanisms mediated by NO and polyamine biosynthesis. In addition, L-arginine reduced endometrial RL95-2 mitochondrial mediated apoptosis through increased phosphorylation of BAD protein.

7191430|t|Cyclic changes in cytosol progesterone receptor of human fallopian tube.
7191430|a|The binding of progesterone (P) to a specific cytoplasmic receptor was studied in cytosol fractions prepared from oviducts obtained from women who elected to undergo sterilization either during a normal menstrual cycle, after the first trimester of pregnancy, or in the puerperium. The in vitro cytosol incubations with [3H]P included cortisol, which eliminated binding to corticosteroid-binding globulin. The relative binding affinities for the cytosol receptor were P > R5020 > > corticosterone = estradiol = testosterone. The P-binding protein had a sedimentation coefficient of 7-8S. Specific [3H]P binding was approximately 4.0 x 10(-13) mol/mg protein at all of the reproductive stages included in this study, except for a 4- to 5-fold increase (approximately 18.0 x 10(-13) mol/mg protein) during the middle and late follicular phases of the menstrual cycle. The sharp decline in P receptor observed during the ealy luteal phase coincided with the luteal rise of serum P. Also, cytosol receptor was replenished when serum P was essentially undetectable.

7566308|t|Lack of influence of recombinant human erythropoietin on parathyroid function in hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism.
7566308|a|The effects of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) treatment on parathyroid function in patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) with secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) is poorly understood. We compared the levels of serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) and the suppressibility of PTH by intravenous calcium infusion before and after 12 weeks of rHuEPO treatment in 8 HD patients with secondary HPT. The suppressibility of PTH by calcium infusion in HD patients was also compared with that of normal subjects. After rHuEPO treatment, in HD patients hematocrit and hemoglobin levels increased significantly from 20.1 +/- 1.3% and 6.65 +/- 0.46 g/dl to 28.7 +/- 1.0% and 9.68 +/- 0.39 g/dl, respectively. The serum intact PTH levels did not change significantly (541.9 +/- 65.3 pg/ml before versus 572.9 +/- 75.3 pg/ml after rHuEPO treatment), nor did serum ionized calcium, phosphate, magnesium, aluminum, alkaline phosphatase, and 1.25(OH)2D levels. Calcium infusion significantly increased serum ionized calcium and suppressed serum PTH levels. However, the increment in serum calcium levels and the percent decrement of serum PTH showed no significant differences before and after rHuEPO treatment in HD patients. Elevations in serum calcium levels during calcium infusions were not significantly different between normal subjects and HD patients. However, the percent maximal decrement in serum PTH level was less in HD patients both before and after rHuEPO treatment than in normal subjects (-75.4 +/- 3.9 and -76.4 +/- 4.1% versus -91.4 +/- 1.4%). We conclude that rHuEPO treatment has no influence on parathyroid function in maintenance HD patients with secondary HPT. In addition, PTH secretion is less suppressed by calcium infusion in the same group of patients.

2490366|t|Homology of the human intestinal Na+/glucose and Escherichia coli Na+/proline cotransporters.
2490366|a|Cotransport proteins are responsible for the active accumulation of organic substrates in cells. Na+ gradients provide the driving force for uptake of most substrates into eukaryotes and for a few substrates in some prokaryotes. We report here the cloning and sequencing of the human intestinal Na+/glucose cotransporter (SGLT1) and compare its structure with other cloned transporters. At the DNA level and the predicted amino acid and secondary structure levels, close homology is evident between the human and rabbit intestinal Na+/glucose cotransporters, and a significant homology is found between these and the Escherichia coli Na+/proline cotransporter (putP). No homology is detectible with other known proteins. We infer from these results that the mammalian Na+/glucose and prokaryote Na+/proline cotransporters share a common ancestral gene.

8286332|t|In vivo phosphorylation site of hexokinase 2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
8286332|a|Yeast hexokinase 2 is known to be a phosphoprotein in vivo, prominently labeled from 32P-inorganic phosphate after a shift of cells to medium with low glucose concentration [Vojtek, A. B., & Fraenkel D. G. (1990) Eur. J. Biochem, 190, 371-375]. The principal and perhaps sole site of phosphorylation is now identified as residue serine-15, by observation of a single tryptic peptide difference, its sequencing and size determination by mass spectrometry, and by mutation to alanine, which prevents phosphorylation in vivo. Although protein kinase A was unlikely to accomplish the phosphorylation in vivo, serine-15 does belong to a protein kinase A consensus phosphorylation sequence, and in vitro phosphorylation by protein kinase A at serine-15 could be shown by labeling and by peptide determination. The alanine-15 mutant enzyme was not phosphorylated in vitro.

17286797|t|Sugar-inducible expression of the nucleolin-1 gene of Arabidopsis thaliana and its role in ribosome synthesis, growth and development.
17286797|a|Animal and yeast nucleolin function as global regulators of ribosome synthesis, and their expression is tightly linked to cell proliferation. Although Arabidopsis contains two genes for nucleolin, AtNuc-L1 is the predominant if not only form of the protein found in most tissues, and GFP-AtNuc-L1 fusion proteins were targeted to the nucleolus. Expression of AtNuc-L1 was strongly induced by sucrose or glucose but not by non-metabolizable mannitol or 2-deoxyglucose. Sucrose also caused enhanced expression of genes for subunits of C/D and H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins, as well as a large number of genes for ribosomal proteins (RPs), suggesting that carbohydrate availability regulates de novo ribosome synthesis. In sugar-starved cells, induction of AtNuc-L1 occurred with 10 mM glucose, which seemed to be a prerequisite for resumption of growth. Disruption of AtNuc-L1 caused an increased steady-state level of pre-rRNA relative to mature 25S rRNA, and resulted in various phenotypes that overlap those reported for several RP gene mutants, including a reduced growth rate, prolonged lifetime, bushy growth, pointed leaf, and defective vascular patterns and pod development. These results suggest that the rate of ribosome synthesis in the meristem has a strong impact not only on the growth but also the structure of plants. The AtNuc-L1 disruptant exhibited significantly reduced sugar-induced expression of RP genes, suggesting that AtNuc-L1 is involved in the sugar-inducible expression of RP genes.

7510873|t|In vitro and in vivo effects of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor on neutrophils in glycogen storage disease type 1B: granulocyte colony-stimulating factor therapy corrects the neutropenia and the defects in respiratory burst activity and Ca2+ mobilization.
7510873|a|Children with glycogen storage disease (GSD) type 1b are susceptible to recurrent bacterial infections and have chronic neutropenia accompanied by phagocytic cell dysfunction including decreased superoxide anion (O2-) generation, calcium (Ca2+) mobilization, and chemotactic activity. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), a cytokine that corrects neutropenia in other diseases, in vitro enhances f-Met-Leu-Phe-triggered neutrophil O2- generation. Short-term pretreatment (15 min) of GSD 1b neutrophils with G-CSF increased the rate of O2- production (p < 0.01); however, this rate was still significantly below the rate of O2- production in control neutrophils. Recombinant human G-CSF (5 micrograms/kg/d) was administered s.c. to a GSD 1b patient. Before treatment, absolute neutrophil counts were < 500/mm3. Two d after G-CSF administration, the absolute neutrophil counts increased to 1333 and remained in the normal range during a 12-mo follow-up period. In vivo, G-CSF therapy increased f-Met-Leu-Phe-stimulated O2- production to 52% of control after 1 mo, and by mo 4, O2- production reached control levels. Our previous studies (J Clin Invest 56:196-202, 1990) demonstrated that decreased O2- production in neutrophils was associated with impaired Ca2+ mobilization. In vivo administration of G-CSF increased f-Met-Leu-Phe-triggered Ca2+ mobilization by neutrophils to 43% of control by mo 1 of G-CSF therapy and to 93% of control by mo 4, thus paralleling the improvements in O2- generation. In contrast, G-CSF therapy had no effect on the defective neutrophil chemotaxis. In summary, G-CSF therapy produced a rapid increase in circulating neutrophils and a gradual correction of O2- production.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

8383353|t|Fermentation of dietary fibre by human colonic bacteria: disappearance of, short-chain fatty acid production from, and potential water-holding capacity of, various substrates.
8383353|a|Several dietary fibre-rich substrates were fermented in vitro with human colonic bacteria obtained from each of three adult male subjects to assess the extent of substrate fermentation short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, and the potential effect of fermented residues on faecal bulk. Substrates tested were two varieties of oat hull fibre, gum arabic, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), soy fibre, psyllium, and six blends containing oat fibre, gum arabic, and CMC in various proportions. All substrates contained greater than 900 g/kg of total dietary fibre except for CMC (816 g) and soy fibre (778 g). In vitro organic matter disappearance during fermentation was greatest for gum arabic (69.5%), intermediate for soy fibre (56.4%), and less than 20% for the two oat fibres, CMC, and psyllium. Averaged across substrates, acetate, propionate, and butyrate were produced in the molar proportion of 64:24:12. Potential water-holding capacity (PWHC) of substrates, a measure of faecal bulking potential, was greatest for CMC (13.5 g H2O/g substrate) and lowest for gum arabic (1.92 g) and soy fibre (1.71 g). Organic matter disappearance and SCFA production of blends were directly proportional to their gum arabic content. Blend PWHC was proportional to CMC content. In vitro procedures are useful in predicting the actions of fibre blends formulated to produce desirable effects in vivo.

23892740|t|Investigation of malic acid production in Aspergillus oryzae under nitrogen starvation conditions.
23892740|a|Malic acid has great potential for replacing petrochemical building blocks in the future. For this application, high yields, rates, and titers are essential in order to sustain a viable biotechnological production process. Natural high-capacity malic acid producers like the malic acid producer Aspergillus flavus have so far been disqualified because of special growth requirements or the production of mycotoxins. As A. oryzae is a very close relative or even an ecotype of A. flavus, it is likely that its high malic acid production capabilities with a generally regarded as safe (GRAS) status may be combined with already existing large-scale fermentation experience. In order to verify the malic acid production potential, two wild-type strains, NRRL3485 and NRRL3488, were compared in shake flasks. As NRRL3488 showed a volumetric production rate twice as high as that of NRRL3485, this strain was selected for further investigation of the influence of two different nitrogen sources on malic acid secretion. The cultivation in lab-scale fermentors resulted in a higher final titer, 30.27 ± 1.05 g liter(-1), using peptone than the one of 22.27 ± 0.46 g liter(-1) obtained when ammonium was used. Through transcriptome analysis, a binding site similar to the one of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast transcription factor Msn2/4 was identified in the upstream regions of glycolytic genes and the cytosolic malic acid production pathway from pyruvate via oxaloacetate to malate, which suggests that malic acid production is a stress response. Furthermore, the pyruvate carboxylase reaction was identified as a target for metabolic engineering, after it was confirmed to be transcriptionally regulated through the correlation of intracellular fluxes and transcriptional changes.

22185818|t|Annexin A2 is a novel cellular redox regulatory protein involved in tumorigenesis.
22185818|a|Annexins are a structurally related family of calcium and phospholipid-binding proteins that are involved in the regulation of a wide range of molecular and cellular processes. Annexin A2 is unique among the annexins in that it possesses redox sensitive cysteine(s). The ubiquitous and abundant expression of ANXA2 in cells and its reactivity with hydrogen peroxide led us to hypothesize that this protein could play a role in cellular redox regulation. Here we show that ANXA2 protein levels are induced by hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, depletion of ANXA2 resulted in the elevation of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon oxidative stress, increased activation of the ROS-induced pro-apoptotic kinases, JNK, p38 and Akt and elevated sensitivity to ROS-mediated cellular damage/death. ANXA2-null mice showed significantly elevated protein oxidation in the liver and lung tissues compared to WT mice. ANXA2 depleted cancer cells showed enhanced cellular protein oxidation concomitant with decreased tumor growth compared to control cancer cells and both the protein oxidation and tumor growth deficit were reversed by the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine, indicating that ANXA2 redox regulatory function plays a major role in tumorigenesis. Ex-vivo human cancer studies showed that up-regulation of the reduced form of ANXA2 is associated with protection of the tumor proteins from oxidation. In summary, our results indicate that ANXA2 redox regulatory function plays an important role protecting cells from oxidative stress, particularly during tumorigenesis.

8132612|t|The protein phosphatase calcineurin is essential for NaCl tolerance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
8132612|a|NaCl-sensitive yeast mutants were isolated to identify genes essential for NaCl tolerance. Complementation of a mutant highly sensitive to Na+ and Li+ led to the isolation of the CNB1 gene. This gene encodes the regulatory subunit (CNB) of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin. Cells deficient in CNB accumulated Li+ due to reduced expression of ENA1, a gene encoding a P-type ATPase involved in Na+ and Li+ efflux. In addition, the K+ transport system of cnb1 delta cells was not converted to the high affinity state that facilitates better discrimination of K+ over Na+. Thus the cnb1 delta strain resembled a trk1 mutant. These results indicate that adaptation to NaCl stress in Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires a signal transduction pathway involving Ca2+ and protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation. In this pathway, calcineurin would coordinate gene expression and activity of ion transporters to facilitate ion homeostasis.

6383500|t|A study of the kinetics of ADP-triggered platelet shape change.
6383500|a|The rapid transformation of human blood platelets from inert discoid cells to spheroechinocytes that is induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) has been followed by right-angle light scattering intensity measurements using a laser light source and a sensitive photomultiplier. Two steps have been observed, and their rate constants have been determined as a function of pH and [ADP] and in the presence and absence of calcium for both platelet-rich plasma and gel-filtered platelets. Both steps are significantly faster in the presence of physiologic levels of calcium. Platelets were fixed prior to and during activation, then examined by phase-contrast and scanning electron microscopy. The light scattering and morphological changes support a model in which, under physiologic conditions of pH, temperature, ionic strength, and calcium concentration, the initial rapid event in platelet shape change is the loss of discoid shape, with a decay time of two to three seconds, leading to an intermediate with short pseudopods. The slower extension of long pseudopods occurs next, with a time constant of approximately seven to eight seconds. These results may help to resolve the contradictory descriptions of the mechanism of platelet shape change that have recently appeared in the literature.

16034819|t|Molecular characterization of the 3-phosphoglycerate kinase gene (PGK1) from the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris.
16034819|a|We report the cloning of the 3-phosphoglycerate kinase gene (PGK1) from the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris by a PCR approach. The coding sequence of the PGK1 gene comprises 1251 bp with the potential to encode a polypeptide of 416 amino acid residues, which shows high identity to homologous proteins from other yeasts. The promoter region of this gene (P(PGK1)) contains regulatory cis-elements found in other PGK1 genes, such as TATA box, CT-rich block and a heat shock element. In the 3' downstream region we identified a tripartite element 5'-TAG-TAGT-TTT-3', which is supposed to be important for transcription termination. As in other yeasts, the PGK1 gene from P. pastoris is present as a single-copy gene. Northern blot analysis revealed that the gene is transcribed as a 1.5 kb mRNA; when cells are grown on glucose the levels of this mRNA are increased two-fold in comparison to cells grown on glycerol. The transcriptional regulation of this gene by the carbon source was further confirmed when the alpha-amylase gene from Bacillus subtilis was placed under the control of P(PGK1): higher levels of expression were obtained when cells were grown on glucose as compared to glycerol and methanol. Preliminary results related to the strength of P(PGK1) show that it represents a potential alternative to constitutive heterologous expression in P. pastoris.

16954157|t|Expression of serotonin7 receptor and coupling of ectopic receptors to protein kinase A and ionic currents in adrenocorticotropin-independent macronodular adrenal hyperplasia causing Cushing's syndrome.
16954157|a|CONTEXT: In ACTH-independent macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (AIMAH) causing Cushing's syndrome, cortisol secretion is controlled by illegitimate membrane receptors. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to characterize the pharmacological properties and the transduction mechanisms of illegitimate receptors, i.e. receptors for serotonin (5-HT), gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), and LH/human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), expressed by AIMAH tissues to evaluate the role of ectopic receptors in the physiopathology of Cushing's syndrome. DESIGN: We used in vitro studies on cultured adrenal hyperplasia cells. SETTING: The setting was a university research laboratory. PATIENTS: AIMAH tissues (H1-H3) were removed from three patients previously screened for illegitimate receptors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The main outcome measures were steroidogenic and electrical activities of cultured adrenal hyperplasia cells. RESULTS: In vitro studies showed that the corticotropic effect of 5-HT was mediated by ectopic 5-HT7 receptors in H1 and H2. GIP and hCG stimulated cortisol production via activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A in H2. On the contrary, the protein kinase A inhibitor H-89 did not affect hCG-induced cortisol production in H3. Activation of 5-HT7 or GIP receptors enhanced T-type calcium current in H1 or H2 and H3, respectively. In addition, GIP reduced the amplitude of transient and sustained potassium currents in H2. Conversely, hCG did not modify T-type calcium current in H3. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that, besides their coupling to the cAMP pathway, illegitimate adrenal receptors can activate additional transduction mechanisms, including modulation of membrane channels.

19652946|t|Regulation of skeletal muscle sucrose, non-fermenting 1/AMP-activated protein kinase-related kinase (SNARK) by metabolic stress and diabetes.
19652946|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Sucrose, non-fermenting 1/AMP-activated protein kinase-related kinase (SNARK) is involved in cellular stress responses linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes. We determined the role of SNARK in response to metabolic stress and insulin action on glucose and lipid metabolism in skeletal muscle. METHODS: Vastus lateralis skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained from normal glucose tolerant (n = 35) and type 2 diabetic (n = 31) men and women for SNARK expression studies. Primary myotube cultures were derived from biopsies obtained from normal glucose tolerant individuals for metabolic studies. RESULTS: SNARK (also known as NUAK2) mRNA expression was unaltered between normal glucose tolerant individuals and type 2 diabetic patients. SNARK expression was increased in skeletal muscle from obese (BMI >31 kg/m(2)) normal glucose tolerant individuals and type 2 diabetic patients (1.4- and 1.4-fold, respectively, p < 0.05) vs overweight (BMI <28 kg/m(2)) normal glucose tolerant individuals and type 2 diabetic patients. SNARK mRNA was increased in myotubes exposed to palmitate (12-fold; p < 0.01), or TNF-alpha (25-fold, p < 0.05), but not to oleate, glucose or IL-6, whereas expression of the AMP-activated protein kinase alpha2 subunit was unaltered. Small interfering (si)RNA against SNARK reduced mRNA and protein in myotubes by 61% and 60%, respectively (p < 0.05). SNARK siRNA was without effect on basal or insulin-stimulated glucose uptake or lipid oxidation, and insufficient to rescue TNF-alpha- or palmitate-induced insulin resistance. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Skeletal muscle SNARK expression is increased in human obesity, and in response to metabolic stressors, but not type 2 diabetes. Partial SNARK depletion failed to modify either glucose or lipid metabolism, or protect against TNF-alpha- or palmitate-induced insulin resistance in primary human myotubes.

12628456|t|The non-neuronal cholinergic system in humans: expression, function and pathophysiology.
12628456|a|Acetylcholine, a prime example of a neurotransmitter, has been detected in bacteria, algae, protozoa, and primitive plants, indicating an extremely early appearance in the evolutionary process (about 3 billion years). In humans, acetylcholine and/or the synthesizing enzyme, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), have been found in epithelial cells (airways, alimentary tract, urogenital tract, epidermis), mesothelial (pleura, pericardium), endothelial, muscle and immune cells (mononuclear cells, granulocytes, alveolar macrophages, mast cells). The widespread expression of non-neuronal acetylcholine is accompanied by the ubiquitous presence of cholinesterase and receptors (nicotinic, muscarinic). Thus, the non-neuronal cholinergic system and non-neuronal acetylcholine, acting as a local cellular signaling molecule, has to be discriminated from the neuronal cholinergic system and neuronal acetylcholine, acting as neurotransmitter. In the human placenta anti-ChAT immunoreactivity is found in multiple subcellular compartments like the cell membrane (microvilli, coated pits), endosomes, cytoskeleton, mitochondria and in the cell nucleus. These locations correspond with the results of experiments where possible functions of non-neuronal acetylcholine have been identified (proliferation, differentiation, organization of the cytoskeleton and the cell-cell contact, locomotion, migration, ciliary activity, immune functions). In the human placenta acetylcholine release is mediated by organic cation transporters. Thus, structural and functional differences are evident between the non-neuronal and neuronal cholinergic system. Enhanced levels of acetylcholine are detected in inflammatory diseases. In conclusion, it is time to revise the role of acetylcholine in humans. Its biological and pathobiological roles have to be elucidated in more detail and possibly, new therapeutical targets may become available.

9832444|t|Heat shock inhibits cytokine-induced nitric oxide synthase expression by rat and human islets.
9832444|a|In this study the effects of heat shock on interleukin-1beta (IL-1)-induced inhibition of islet metabolic function were examined. Treatment of rat islets for 18 h with IL-1 results in a potent inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The inhibitory effects of IL-1 on insulin secretion are completely prevented if islets are pretreated for 60 min at 42 C before cytokine stimulation. Heat shock also prevents IL-1-induced inhibition of insulinoma RINm5F cell mitochondrial aconitase activity. The protective effects of heat shock on islet metabolic function are associated with the inhibition of IL-1-stimulated inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS or NOS II) expression. Islets heat shocked for 60 min at 42 C fail to express iNOS (messenger RNA or protein) or produce nitrite in response to IL-1. IL-1-induced iNOS expression by rat islets requires activation of the transcriptional regulator nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). Heat shock prevents IL-1-induced NF-kappaB nuclear localization by inhibiting inhibitory protein kappaB (IkappaB) degradation in rat islets. Similar to rat islets, heat shock (stimulated by 90 min incubation at 42 C) prevents IL-1 + interferon gamma-induced iNOS expression and NF-kappaB nuclear localization in human islets. IL-1 also stimulates heat-shock protein 70 (hsp 70) expression by rat islets, and hsp 70 expression is dependent on islet production of nitric oxide. Last, evidence is presented that implicates nitric oxide as a stimulus for the expression of proteins that participate in islet recovery from nitric oxide-mediated damage. These studies indicate that heat shock prevents cytokine-induced islet damage by inhibiting iNOS expression, and suggest that nitric oxide is one effector molecule that stimulates the expression of factors involved in beta-cell recovery from nitric oxide-mediated damage.

8235659|t|Bcl-2 inhibition of neural death: decreased generation of reactive oxygen species.
8235659|a|The proto-oncogene bcl-2 inhibits apoptotic and necrotic neural cell death. Expression of Bcl-2 in the GT1-7 neural cell line prevented death as a result of glutathione depletion. Intracellular reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxides rose rapidly in control cells depleted of glutathione, whereas cells expressing Bcl-2 displayed a blunted increase and complete survival. Modulation of the increase in reactive oxygen species influenced the degree of cell death. Yeast mutants null for superoxide dismutase were partially rescued by expression of Bcl-2. Thus, Bcl-2 prevents cell death by decreasing the net cellular generation of reactive oxygen species.

11013718|a|Nickel electrodes chemically modified with an interfacial layer of nickel ferrocyanide are shown to be of analytical utility for simultaneously sensing sodium and potassium ions in aqueous solutions, human whole blood serum, and human whole blood. By controlling the charge-transfer characteristics of this versatile interface, interfering blood proteins and potential interferences associated with other alkali cations can be avoided. A solid-state model which explains the excellent simultaneous selectivity and sensitivity of the nickel ferricyanide interface is proposed.

27622546|t|Gonadotropins in the Russian Sturgeon: Their Role in Steroid Secretion and the Effect of Hormonal Treatment on Their Secretion.
27622546|a|In the reproduction process of male and female fish, pituitary derived gonadotropins (GTHs) play a key role. To be able to specifically investigate certain functions of Luteinizing (LH) and Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) in Russian sturgeon (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii; st), we produced recombinant variants of the hormones using the yeast Pichia pastoris as a protein production system. We accomplished to create in vitro biologically active heterodimeric glycoproteins consisting of two associated α- and β-subunits in sufficient quantities. Three dimensional modelling of both GTHs was conducted in order to study the differences between the two GTHs. Antibodies were produced against the unique β-subunit of each of the GTHs, in order to be used for immunohistochemical analysis and to develop an ELISA for blood and pituitary hormone quantification. This detection technique revealed the specific localization of the LH and FSH cells in the sturgeon pituitary and pointed out that both cell types are present in substantially higher numbers in mature males and females, compared to immature fish. With the newly attained option to prevent cross-contamination when investigating on the effects of GTH administration, we compared the steroidogeneic response (estradiol and 11-Keto testosterone (11-KT) in female and males, respectively) of recombinant stLH, stFSH, and carp pituitary extract in male and female sturgeon gonads at different developmental stages. Finally, we injected commercially available gonadotropin releasing hormones analog (GnRH) to mature females, and found a moderate effect on the development of ovarian follicles. Application of only testosterone (T) resulted in a significant increase in circulating levels of 11-KT whereas the combination of GnRH + T did not affect steroid levels at all. The response pattern for estradiol demonstrated a similar situation. FSH levels showed significant increases when GnRH + T was administered, while no changes were present in LH levels.

4086485|t|Spectrophotometric determination of oxalate in urine and plasma with oxalate oxidase.
4086485|a|In order to establish a standard procedure for the spectrophotometric determination of urinary and plasma oxalate with oxalate oxidase (Laker, M.F., et al. (1980) Clin. Chem. 26, 827-830; Sugiura, M., et al. (1980) Clin. Chim. Acta 105, 393-399) and to define the limitations of the method, the procedures and reactions involved in the assay have been examined. Among the chromogenic hydrogen donors for peroxidase tested, a combination of 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone (MBTH) and sodium N-sulfopropylaniline (HALPS) was found to be best for the oxalate determination under the conditions used. Urine contained substance(s) which were inhibitory to the measurement of hydrogen peroxide by the peroxidase-catalyzed oxidative condensation of MBTH and HALPS, but they were largely removed by charcoal treatment at pH 5.6 without significant loss of oxalate. Deproteinization of plasma was carried out by ultrafiltration through a membrane cone (Centriflo CF-25) at neutral pH. The plasma oxalate ultrafiltrability under the conditions employed was calculated to be approximately 95%. A standard assay system for oxalate in these urine and plasma samples was then set up based on a series of studies on the reactions involved in the assay. In the case of normal plasma, however, the absorbance change was very small due to the low concentration of oxalate, and in addition, pretreatment of plasma with excess oxalate decarboxylase followed by the ultrafiltration and oxalate determination did not abolish completely the oxalate oxidase-dependent absorbance increase. It was concluded that the enzymic method was useful for the assay of urinary oxalate and in detecting elevated levels of plasma oxalate such as those in hemodialysis patients but was not sensitive enough to determine accurately the normal or decreased level of oxalate in plasma. The apparent concentration of oxalate in normal human plasma was measured in this work as 3.5 +/- 0.8 microM (mean +/- S.D., n = 8), and this result was interpreted to mean that the concentration of plasma oxalate was less than approximately 3.5 microM, as estimated by the present method.

24247205|t|Potential of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae recombinant strain lacking ethanol and glycerol biosynthesis pathways in efficient anaerobic bioproduction.
24247205|a|Saccharomyces cerevisiae shows high growth activity under low pH conditions and can be used for producing acidic chemicals such as organic acids as well as fuel ethanol. However, ethanol can also be a problematic by-product in the production of chemicals except for ethanol. We have reported that a stable low-ethanol production phenotype was achieved by disrupting 6 NADH-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase genes of S. cerevisiae. Moreover, the genes encoding the NADH-dependent glycerol biosynthesis enzymes were further disrupted because the ADH-disrupted recombinant strain showed high glycerol production to maintain intracellular redox balance. The recombinant strain incapable producing ethanol and glycerol could have the potential to be a host for producing metabolite(s) whose biosynthesis is coupled with NADH oxidation. Indeed, we successfully achieved almost 100% yield for L-lactate production using this recombinant strain as a host. In addition, the potential of our constructed recombinant strain for efficient bioproduction, particularly under anaerobic conditions, is also discussed.

8360850|t|Mechanism of phosphate adsorption to a three-dimensional structure of boehmite in the presence of bovine serum albumin.
8360850|a|A new microcrystalline boehmite (tentatively named PT-A) was synthesized as an efficient phosphate adsorbent to replace aluminum hydroxide gel. The characteristic structure of PT-A was examined by nitrogen adsorption/desorption, X-ray diffraction, deviation microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy to establish a pore structural model of PT-A. With this model structure, the details of the mechanism of interaction between PT-A and phosphate in the presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA) are discussed. PT-A is a spherical particle with a diameter of approximately 100 microns and a porous surface structure, and its inside is packed with boehmite microcrystals (crystallite size, 2 nm). PT-A has three types of pores in its structure: a micropore with a narrow size-distribution, a mesopore with a broad size-distribution, and a macropore (radii of pores are 0.7, 1-20, and approximately 300 nm, respectively). When phosphate was incubated with PT-A in human gastric and intestinal juices or in an aqueous solution containing BSA, the amounts of phosphate adsorbed by PT-A were not affected by the presence of proteins. The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms and energy dispersive X-ray analyses demonstrated that phosphate could diffuse to the smaller tunnels freely even if the external surface of PT-A was covered with BSA. It was also demonstrated that the main site of adsorption for phosphate was in micropores of PT-A, whereas BSA was adsorbed only to the external surface and none entered inside smaller tunnels consisting of micro- and mesopores.

6632999|t|The age-dependent metabolic decline of the red blood cell.
6632999|a|The oxidative and non-oxidative utilization of glucose was evaluated in human erythrocytes of different ages, separated by density gradient ultracentrifugation. Young red blood cells are able to metabolize 2.5 times more glucose than old ones; on the other hand, the amount of glucose utilized via the hexose monophosphate shunt does not show any age dependence. Glucose metabolism evaluated during in vivo ageing of a rabbit red cell population shows results very similar to those obtained for human cells. Metabolic stimulation of glucose utilization by high phosphate in both young and old human red cells increases glucose utilization by 40%. In the same way young and old erythrocytes were able to increase the amount of glucose metabolized via the hexose monophosphate shunt when an oxidative stimulus (methylene blue) was introduced. Human erythrocytes of different age possess similar abilities to transport glucose so that an age-dependent defect in glucose transport can be excluded. The ATP content of human and rabbit red blood cells, as a function of cell age, follows the decrease in glucose metabolized via the Embden-Meyerhof pathway. Reduced glutathione, on the other hand, after a small decrease associated with the "maturation" of reticulocytes into red cells, remains constant like the rate of the hexose monophosphate shunt.

23353575|t|A high-throughput screen to identify enhancers of ADAR-mediated RNA-editing.
23353575|a|Adenosine to inosine deamination of RNA is widespread in metazoa. Inosines are recognized as guanosines and, therefore, this RNA-editing can influence the coding potential, localization and stability of RNAs. Therefore, RNA editing contributes to the diversification of the transcriptome in a flexible manner. The editing reaction is performed by adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs), which are essential for normal life and development in many organisms. Changes in editing levels are observed during development but also in neurological pathologies like schizophrenia, depression or tumors. Frequently, changes in editing levels are not reflected by changes in ADAR levels suggesting a regulation of enzyme activity. Until now, only a few factors are known that influence the activity of ADARs. Here we present a two-stage in vivo editing screen aimed to isolate enhancers of editing. A primary, high-throughput yeast-screen is combined with a more accurate secondary screen in mammalian cells that uses a fluorescent read-out to detect minor differences in RNA-editing. The screen was successfully employed to identify DSS1/SHFM1, the RNA binding protein hnRNP A2/B1 and a 3' UTR as enhancers of editing. By varying intracellular DSS1/SHFM1 levels, we can modulate A to I editing by up to 30%. Proteomic analysis indicates an interaction of DSS1/SHFM1 and hnRNP A2/B1 suggesting that both factors may act by altering the cellular RNP landscape. An extension of this screen to cDNAs from different tissues or developmental stages may prove useful for the identification of additional enhancers of RNA-editing.

14762924|t|Anti-inflammatory effects of a titanium-peroxy gel: role of oxygen metabolites and apoptosis.
14762924|a|Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) are among the first inflammatory cells to arrive at an implant interface, where they encounter with the foreign material and may produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). During the interaction between titanium and ROS, titanium-peroxy (Ti-peroxy) compounds may be formed. We used a Ti-peroxy gel, made from titanium and hydrogen peroxide, to study the effects of Ti-peroxy compounds on PMN. In the absence of serum, the Ti-peroxy gel decreased the oxidative response of PMN to yeast and PMA and reduced PMN apoptosis without inducing necrosis. These effects could not be ascribed to the release of hydrogen peroxide from the Ti-peroxy gel, because a steady-state hydrogen peroxide producing system failed to mimic the effects of the gel. The effects were similarly unaffected when PMN were preincubated with beta(2)-integrin antibodies, questioning the involvement of adhesion molecules. Nevertheless, when a filter was used to separate the Ti-peroxy gel from the cells, the gel effect on PMN life span was abolished, pointing to a contact-dependent mechanism. In the presence of serum, the Ti-peroxy gel had no effect on the PMN oxidative response and life span, but appeared rather inert. In summary, this study demonstrates that the Ti-peroxy gel has potentially anti-inflammatory properties through a combined peroxide and physical contact effect, supporting the notion that interactions between titanium and inflammatory cells are responsible for the good performance of titanium in vivo.

28763481|t|Osteoclastic differentiation and resorption is modulated by bioactive metal ions Co2+, Cu2+ and Cr3+ incorporated into calcium phosphate bone cements.
28763481|a|Biologically active metal ions in low doses have the potential to accelerate bone defect healing. For successful remodelling the interaction of bone graft materials with both bone-forming osteoblasts and bone resorbing osteoclasts is crucial. In the present study brushite forming calcium phosphate cements (CPC) were doped with Co2+, Cu2+ and Cr3+ and the influence of these materials on osteoclast differentiation and activity was examined. Human osteoclasts were differentiated from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) both on the surface and in indirect contact to the materials on dentin discs. Release of calcium, phosphate and bioactive metal ions was determined using ICP-MS both in the presence and absence of the cells. While Co2+ and Cu2+ showed a burst release, Cr3+ was released steadily at very low concentrations (below 1 μM) and both calcium and phosphate release of the cements was considerably changed in the Cr3+ modified samples. Direct cultivation of PBMC/osteoclasts on Co2+ cements showed lower attached cell number compared to the reference but high activity of osteoclast specific enzymes tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) and cathepsin K (CTSK) and significantly increased gene expression of vitronectin receptor. Indirect cultivation with diluted Co2+ cement extracts revealed highest resorbed area compared to all other modifications and the reference. Cu2+ cements had cytotoxic effect on PBMC/osteoclasts during direct cultivation, while indirect cultivation with diluted extracts from Cu2+ cements did not provoke cytotoxic effects but a strictly inhibited resorption. Cr3+ doped cements did not show cytotoxic effects at all. Gene expression and enzyme activity of CTSK was significantly increased in direct culture. Indirect cultivation with Cr3+ doped cements revealed significantly higher resorbed area compared to the reference. In conclusion Cr3+ doped calcium phosphate cements are an innovative cement modification because of their high cytocompatibility and support of active resorption by osteoclasts.

20711885|t|Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in seizure-induced neuronal cell death.
20711885|a|Epilepsy is considered one of the most common neurological disorders worldwide. The burst firing associated with prolonged epileptic discharges could lead to a large number of changes and cascades of events at the cellular level. From its role as the cellular powerhouse, the mitochondrion is emerging as a key participant in cell death because of its association with an ever-growing list of apoptosis-related proteins. Prolonged seizures may result in the mitochondrial dysfunction and increased production of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide (NO) precede neuronal cell death and cause subsequent epileptogenesis. Emerging evidences also showed that intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway may contribute to the neuropathology of human epilepsy, particularly in the hippocampus. Subsequent laboratory studies in the animal model of status epilepticus provide credence to the notion that activation of nuclear factor-κB upregulates NO synthase (NOS) II gene expression with temporal correlation of NOS II derived NO-, superoxide anion- and peroxynitrite-dependent reduction in mitochondrial Complex I activity, leading to apoptotic neuronal cell death in the hippocampus. These results will broaden our understanding on the intimate link between mitochondrial function, oxidative stress and mitochondria-dependent apoptotic signaling triggered by epileptic seizures. It will open a new vista in the development of more effective neuroprotective strategies against seizure-induced brain damage by modification of bioenergetic failure in the mitochondria and in the design of novel treatment perspectives for therapy-resistant forms of epilepsy.

12893828|t|Human erythrocyte membrane band 3 protein influences hemoglobin cooperativity. Possible effect on oxygen transport.
12893828|a|Hemoglobin function can be modulated by the red cell membrane but some mechanistic details are incomplete. For example, the 43-kDa chymotryptic fragment of the cytoplasmic portion of red cell membrane Band 3 protein and its corresponding N-terminal 11-residue synthetic peptide lower the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin but effects on cooperativity are unclear. Using highly purified preparations, we also find a lowered Hill coefficient (n values <2) at subequivalent ratios of Band 3 fragment or of synthetic peptide to Hb, resulting in an oxygen affinity that is moderately decreased and a partially hyperbolic shape for the O2 binding curve. Both normal HbA and sickle HbS display this property. Thus, the determinant responsible for the Hb cooperativity decreases by the 43-kDa fragment resides within its first 11 N-terminal residues. This effect is observed in the absence of chloride and is reversed by its addition. As effector to Hb ratios approach equivalence or with saturating chloride normal cooperativity is restored, and oxygen affinity is further lowered because the shape of the oxygen binding curve becomes completely sigmoidal. The relative efficiencies of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG), the 43-kDa Band 3 fragment, and the 11-residue synthetic peptide in lowering cooperativity are very similar. The findings are explained based on the stereochemical mechanism of cooperativity because of two populations of T-state hemoglobin tetramers, one with bound effector and the other with free (Perutz, M. F. (1989) Q. Rev. Biophys. 22, 139-237). As a result of this property, hemoglobin at the membrane inner surface in contact with the N-terminal region of Band 3 could preferentially bind O2 at low oxygen tension and then release it upon saturation with 2,3-diphosphoglycerate in the interior of the red cell. Membrane modulation of hemoglobin oxygen affinity has particularly interesting implications for the polymerization of hemoglobin S in the sickle red cell.

11026755|t|Sex steroids and bone metabolism: comparison of in vitro effects of 17beta-estradiol and testosterone on human osteosarcoma cell lines of various gender and differentiation.
11026755|a|Although numerous clinical studies have demonstrated the beneficial effect of preventing postmenopausal bone loss in elder women by long-term estrogen administration, effects of estrogen at the cellular level still remain unclear. Efforts to determine the precise role of bone cells in estrogen-mediated pathways are often hampered by the lack of suitable cell culture models. Presuming that sex steroids have a direct, stimulating effect on bone cells in vitro, we investigated the influence of 17beta-estradiol, testosterone and 1,25(OH)2D, on cell proliferation and differentiation using four established human osteosarcoma (HOS) cell lines of different gender of the donors (male origin: MG 63, HOS 58; female origin: SaOS 2, TE 85). These cell lines are believed to represent different stages of osteogenic maturation. Thus, the aim of this study was to clarify if possible responses to sex steroids are related to gender or osteogenic commitment of the individual cell culture. HOS cells were cultured in six-well plates and underwent hormone treatment (1 nM and 10 nM 17beta-estradiol. 0.1 nM and I nM testosterone and 1 microM 1,25(OH)2D3) for 48 h hours. Cell proliferation was determined by measuring total cell numbers. Cell function was studied by measuring alkaline phosphatase activity and secreted osteocalcin. In this study, estrogen significantly increased proliferation of both one male (MG 63) and one female (SaOS 2) cell line, but decreased proliferation of the female HOS TE 85 cell line significantly. Testosterone treatment had a positive effect on proliferation of only one female cell line (SaOS 2). A significant increase of alkaline phosphatase activity in SaOS 2 and HOS 58 cells and of osteocalcin levels in SaOS 2 cells was detected following estrogen treatment. Administration of 1.25(OH)2D3 was followed by an increased cell proliferation in HOS 58, MG 63 and SaOS 2. Significant gender-related differences could not be demonstrated. In conclusion, response to hormonal treatment with sex steroids is not related to the gender of the osteosarcoma cell line, but rather depends on its osteoblastic commitment.

9805234|t|Antioxidant properties of Lunularia cruciata (Bryophyta) extract.
9805234|a|The effects of Lunularia cruciata (L.) Dum (Bryophyta) acetonic extract was studied in vitro by means of luminol-dependent chemiluminescence (CL) emission from human peripheral whole blood phagocytes and isolated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). L. cruciata adult thalli underwent extraction with acetone. CL emission was evaluated in an automated luminometer, measuring the oxygen free-radical production by phagocytes incubated with opsonized zymosan (OZ) or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), in absence or in presence of various concentrations of L. cruciata extract. The CL results indicated that L. cruciata induced significant changes in light emission from whole blood phagocytes, as well as isolated PMNs. Its inhibitory activity was more evident when resting isolated PMNs were studied. When the cells were activated, the greatest inhibitory effect was observed with PMA. The L. cruciata activity could be caused by several compounds, such as flavonoids and/or sesquiterpenes, present in the acetonic extract.

15708375|t|A reappraisal of the genomic organization of human Nox1 and its splice variants.
15708375|a|The recent discovery of non-phagocytic NAD(P)H oxidases belonging to the Nox family of enzymes sharing extensive homology to the leukocyte NAD(P)H oxidase has revolutionized our understanding of oxidative signaling related to fundamental biological processes and disease states. One form of this enzyme, Nox1, is a growth factor-responsive enzyme that catalyzes formation of the reactive oxygen species superoxide (O(2)(-)) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). Its expression is linked to a number of biological responses including cellular proliferation, angiogenesis, and activation of cellular signaling pathways. Whereas early published studies have described three distinct isoforms of Nox1, the current body of literature fails to adequately recognize this notion. Also, functional differences between isoforms remain relatively unexplored. Herein, we report that expression of human Nox1 is restricted to two distinct isoforms derived from a single gene; that is, the full-length gene product and a shorter spliced variant which lacks one of the NAD(P)H binding domains. We have developed PCR primer sets that distinguish between the two forms of Nox1 in several human cell lines. We could not find evidence for expression of the shortest reported form of Nox1 (NOH-1S), previously identified as a proton channel, and the absence of paired splice sites in the gene suggests that it represents a reverse transcriptase artifact. A survey of the scientific literature reveals that the majority of studies related to Nox1 do not utilize molecular strategies that would adequately discern between the two Nox1 variants. The current literature suggest the two identified isoforms of human Nox1 (which we have named Nox1-L and Nox1-S) may be functionally distinct. Future studies related to Nox1 will benefit from establishing the identity of the Nox1 isoform expressed and the functions attributed to each variant.

8004151|t|Enhanced generation of O2- by human neutrophils via a complement iC3b/Mac-1 interaction.
8004151|a|There is evidence for a tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha)-initiated and CD11b/CD18-dependent burst of superoxide anion (O2-) and hydrogen peroxide production by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes which are adherent to surfaces bearing a variety of proteins. In the current studies neutrophils were stimulated with opsonized (by fresh human serum) zymosan particles in the presence of cytochalasin B, to prevent internalization of particles and to simulate the interaction of neutrophils with protein-bearing surfaces. Under these conditions, the cells demonstrated 2.9-fold greater production of O2- when compared to nonopsonized zymosan particles. Heat inactivation or cobra venom factor treatment of human serum prior to opsonization resulted in 98% and 66% reductions, respectively, in O2- responses. C3 and factor B were required for this response, since sera deficient in either component caused 56 and 68% reductions, respectively, in O2- production. Sera deficient in Clq, C2, C4, C5, C6, C7 or C9 showed no defect in their ability to enhance O2- responses to zymosan particles. Monoclonal antibody to iC3b, but not monoclonal antibodies to C3c or C3d, caused a 29% reduction (p < 0.01) in O2- generation. Antibodies to CD18 (R15.7) or CD11b (CL44 and 60.1) reduced the incremental production of O2- by 76, 71 and 77%, respectively. Two antibodies directed against CD11a as well as the isotype-matched control (MOPC 21) were without effects. These data suggest that, in this model of neutrophil activation, the pathway for O2- generation is a Mac-1 (but not LFA-1)-dependent pathway and also requires iC3b. These findings may be relevant to complement-mediated, neutrophil-dependent vascular injury in vivo.

28217931|t|How do ADARs bind RNA? New protein-RNA structures illuminate substrate recognition by the RNA editing ADARs.
28217931|a|Deamination of adenosine in RNA to form inosine has wide ranging consequences on RNA function including amino acid substitution to give proteins not encoded in the genome. What determines which adenosines in an mRNA are subject to this modification reaction? The answer lies in an understanding of the mechanism and substrate recognition properties of adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs). Our recent publication of X-ray crystal structures of the human ADAR2 deaminase domain bound to RNA editing substrates shed considerable light on how the catalytic domains of these enzymes bind RNA and promote adenosine deamination. Here we review in detail the deaminase domain-RNA contact surfaces and present models of how full length ADARs, bearing double stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs) and deaminase domains, could process naturally occurring substrate RNAs.

10576451|a|The generation both superoxide and a mixture of reactive oxygen species was recorded in a suspension of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate. While stobadine dose-dependently decreased chemiluminescence, only its highest concentration used reduced significantly superoxide generation. The results suggest that stobadine is a more effective scavenger of free radicals rather than a quencher of superoxide anion.

24701347|t|L-Phenylalanine Transport in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Participation of GAP1, BAP2, and AGP1.
24701347|a|We focused on the participation of GAP1, BAP2, and AGP1 in L-phenylalanine transport in yeast. In order to study the physiological functions of GAP1, BAP2, and AGP1 in L-phenylalanine transport, we examined the kinetics, substrate specificity, and regulation of these systems, employing isogenic haploid strains with the respective genes disrupted individually and in combination. During the characterization of phenylalanine transport, we noted important regulatory phenomena associated with these systems. Our results show that Agp1p is the major transporter of the phenylalanine in a gap1 strain growing in synthetic media with leucine present as an inducer. In a wild type strain grown in the presence of leucine, when ammonium ion was the nitrogen source, Bap2p is the principal phenylalanine carrier.

11224665|t|Nutrient absorption.
11224665|a|Some interesting advances in mechanisms and regulation of nutrient absorption were reported last year. Further evidence was obtained that the rate-limiting step in triacylglycerol absorption, especially with large doses of lipid, is transport of prechylomicrons from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. Targeted disruption of the adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter in mice produced changes similar to human Tangier disease and suggested that this mouse may be a model for studying intestinal high-density lipoprotein assembly and secretion. A new mechanism for carbohydrate malabsorption was discovered: in sucrase-isomaltase deficiency, the enzyme fails to anchor in the brush border membrane and so is secreted into the lumen, where it is ineffective. Glycosylating insulin at B1 phenylalanine permitted it to bind to the brush border membrane and greatly enhanced its hypoglycemic activity when given orally. CaCo-2 cells and normal human enterocytes were shown to have two variants of the human sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter, hSVCT1; one is active and the other is an inactive splice variant. In rats, the divalent metal ion transporter, DMT1, appeared to be important for regulation of both absorption of iron and its movement into the liver.

15009217|t|Ouabain stimulates endothelin release and expression in human endothelial cells without inhibiting the sodium pump.
15009217|a|Ouabain, a sodium pump (Na+/ K+-ATPase) inhibitor, has been shown to act as a hormone and is possibly involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension. The mechanism by which ouabain may act was investigated using primary cultures of human umbilical artery endothelial cells (HUAECs), which are known to express and release the vasoconstrictive hormone endothelin (ET-1). Five minutes after application, low concentrations of ouabain induced Ca2+ oscillations and stimulated ET-1 release from endothelial cells into the medium. To investigate whether the observed effects were due to inhibition of the sodium pump, the effects of ouabain on the uptake of 86Rb+ by HUAECs were examined. Unexpectedly, ouabain concentrations below 10 nm stimulated 86Rb+ uptake by 15-20%, and in some experiments by 50%, results that are consistent with a stimulation of the pump. Within the concentration range 1-10 nm, ouabain induced a 2.5-fold stimulation (phosphorylation) of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase). After incubation of HUAECs with ouabain for 12 h, the glycoside stimulated cell growth by 49 +/- 4%, as measured by cell number, with a maximum response at 5 nm. At similar concentrations, ouabain also increased ET-1 mRNA abundance by 19.5 +/- 3.1%. The results indicate that, by influencing ET-1 expression and release, ouabain may contribute to the regulation of vascular tone. The data also confirm that it is not a global inhibition of the sodium pump that is involved in the mechanism of action of this cardiac glycoside.

8325387|t|Regulation of c-myc expression by sodium butyrate in the colon carcinoma cell line Caco-2.
8325387|a|The human colon carcinoma cell line Caco-2 spontaneously undergoes enterocytic differentiation in culture. We used sodium butyrate to modify differentiation and growth properties of this cell line and considered c-myc expression as a potential target. Degradation of normal c-myc mRNAs with a half-life of 20 min is not coupled to translation in this cell line, as determined by cycloheximide treatment. We show that butyrate reduces c-myc mRNA levels after a 30 min delay. Butyrate does not affect c-myc expression at the level of transcriptional initiation or elongation, as determined by run-on analysis, but at a post-transcriptional level. Cycloheximide blocks butyrate-dependent reduction of c-myc mRNA levels. Cross-linking experiments show that a 34 kDa protein binds specifically to the c-myc AU-rich instability determinant found in the 3'-untranslated region (ARE). Binding of this protein to the ARE is not modulated by butyrate or cycloheximide. These experiments suggest that butyrate induces a factor involved in c-myc mRNA degradation that differs from the known ARE-associated proteins. Post-transcriptional modification of gene expression could be one of the major targets for this anti-proliferative agent.

6323010|t|Effects of redox agents on the Ca2+-activated K+ channel.
6323010|a|The sensitivity to Ca2+ of the Ca2+-dependent K+ channel can be increased by the artificial electron donor system ascorbate + phenazine-methosulphate in a variety of animal cells. In the human erythrocyte the shift from the 'low' to the 'high-affinity' state seems to depend on the reduction of a membrane component accepting 2 electrons and with an standard redox potential (pH 7.5) of about 47 mV. The relevance of this redox modulation under physiological circumstances is unknown at the moment.

14505347|t|Catalase, but not MnSOD, inhibits glucose deprivation-activated ASK1-MEK-MAPK signal transduction pathway and prevents relocalization of Daxx: hydrogen peroxide as a major second messenger of metabolic oxidative stress.
14505347|a|Overexpression of catalase, but not manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), inhibited glucose deprivation-induced cytotoxicity and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) activation in human prostate adenocarcinoma DU-145 cells. Suppression of JNK1 activation by catalase overexpression resulted from inhibition of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) activation by preventing dissociation of thioredoxin (TRX) from ASK1. Overexpression of catalase also inhibited relocalization of Daxx from the nucleus to the cytoplasm as well as association of Daxx with ASK1 during glucose deprivation. Taken together, hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) rather than superoxide anion (O(2) (*-)) acts as a second messenger of metabolic oxidative stress to activate the ASK1-MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathway.

2391961|t|Direct effect of plasma sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) on the metabolic clearance rate of 17 beta-estradiol in the primate.
2391961|a|Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) has been shown to be a major determinant of testosterone clearance in the primate. It has also been suggested that SHBG would also be a determinant of estradiol clearance (MCR-E2). However, published studies have suggested that the MCR-E2 do not always vary with changes in the level of SHBG. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to address this issue. The baseline MCR-E2 was determined in adult male pigtail macaques (Macaca nemestrina). Following the baseline determination of MCR-E2 the animals were infused with either purified human (h) SHBG or antibody against hSHBG, which also has a high degree of cross-reactivity with primate SHBG. Following the infusions of either hSHBG or anti-SHBG, MCR-E2 was again determined. In addition, luteinizing hormone (LH) was measured using a mouse Leydig cell bioassay. Following the infusion of hSHBG, a marked increase in serum SHBG was noted and the MCR-E2 decreased. Associated with the increase in SHBG, the SHBG bound T levels decreased and LH increased. Following the infusion of antibody, serum SHBG decreased, and the MCR-E2 also decreased. With the decrease in SHBG following the antibody infusion, non-SHBG bound T increased and serum LH fell. This study demonstrates that an increase in the serum SHBG levels is associated with a decrease in MCR-E2, however, an acute decrease in serum SHBG also decreases the MCR-E2. This later result demonstrates that factors in addition to serum SHBG binding may be important in determining the MCR-E2.

15567742|t|Effects of cell cycle on telomerase activity and on hepatitis B virus replication in HepG2 2.2.15 cells.
15567742|a|BACKGROUND: It has been shown that telomerase activity and hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication are closely associated with cell cycle. This study aimed to further investigate the effects of cell cycle on telomerase activity and on HBV replication. METHODS: Human hepatoma cells transfected with HBV DNA (HepG2 2.2.15 cell line) were treated respectively with serum deprivation, all-trans retinoic acid (RA), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), or sodium butyrate. The cell cycle of HepG2 2.2.15 cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. The telomerase activities of the cells were detected by TRAP-PCR-ELISA. HBV DNA in culture medium was assayed by a fluorescent quantitative PCR assay and a semiquantitative dot blot hybridization technique. HBsAg and HBeAg in culture media were quantitatively examined by an ELISA assay. RESULTS: Treatments with serum deprivation, RA, DMSO, or sodium butyrate inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 2.2.15 cells and led to cell arrest in the G0/G1 phase of cell cycle. The percentage of the G0/G1 phase in the groups of sodium butyrate, DMSO, RA and serum-free was 85.2%, 71.9%, 68.3% and 65.2%, respectively, but in the control group, 43.1% (P<0.01). The activities of telomerase of the cells were also significantly inhibited by 82.8%, 74.6%, 76.1% and 69.4% respectively. In addition, HBV replication of the HepG2 2.2.15 cells remarkably increased as shown by the contents of HBV DNA, HBsAg and HBeAg in the culture media of the cells treated with sodium butyrate, DMSO, RA or serum deprivation (P<0.01). The amounts of HBV DNA in the groups of sodium butyrate, DMSO, RA, serum deprivation and control were 6.7X10(6), 4.8X10(6), 4.4X10(6), 5.1X10(6) and 1.2X10(6) copies/ml, respectively (P<0.01). Telomerase was expressed mainly in the cells in S phase. HBV replication increased in quiescent cells (G0/G1 phase), and decreased in proliferating phase (S phase). CONCLUSION: The current data approve that HBV replication is associated with the cellular proliferative activity.

21601445|t|Utilization of residues from agro-forest industries in the production of high value bacterial cellulose.
21601445|a|Bacterial cellulose (BC), a very peculiar form of cellulose, is gaining considerable importance due to its unique properties. In this study, several residues, from agro-forestry industries, namely grape skins aqueous extract, cheese whey, crude glycerol and sulfite pulping liquor were evaluated as economic carbon and nutrient sources for the production of BC. The most relevant BC amounts attained with the residues from the wine and pulp industries were 0.6 and 0.3 g/L, respectively, followed by biodiesel crude residue and cheese whey with productions of about, 0.1 g/L after 96 h of incubation. Preliminary results on the addition of other nutrient sources (yeast extract, nitrogen and phosphate) to the residues-based culture media indicated that, in general, these BC productions could be increased by ~200% and ~100% for the crude glycerol and grape skins, respectively, after the addition organic or inorganic nitrogen.

39062|t|Isolation from soil and properties of the extreme thermophile Clostridium thermohydrosulfuricum.
39062|a|Thirteen strains of a strict anaerobic, extreme thermophilic bacterium were isolated from soil samples of moderate temperature, from a sewage plant in Georgia, and from hot springs in Utah and Wyoming. They were identified as strains of Clostridium thermohydrosulfuricum. The guanosine + cytosine content (moles percent) was 37.6 (determined by buoyant density) and 34.1 (determined by melting temperature). All strains required a factor present in yeast extract or tryptone growth. Growth characteristics were as follows: a pH range of 5 to 9, with the optimum between 6.9 to 7.5, in a temperature range of 40 to 78 degrees C, with the optimum at 68 degrees C. The doubling time, when grown on glucose at temperature and pH optima, was 1.2 h. The main products of glucose fermentation were ethanol, lactate, acetate, CO2, and H2. The fermentation was inhibited by H2. Formation of spores occurred easily on glucose-agar medium or when cultures growing at temperatures above 65 degrees C were allowed to cool to temperature below 55 degrees C. C. thermohydrosulfuricum occurs widely distributed in the natural environment.

17608725|t|Nucleotide binding to human UMP-CMP kinase using fluorescent derivatives -- a screening based on affinity for the UMP-CMP binding site.
17608725|a|Methylanthraniloyl derivatives of ATP and CDP were used in vitro as fluorescent probes for the donor-binding and acceptor-binding sites of human UMP-CMP kinase, a nucleoside salvage pathway kinase. Like all NMP kinases, UMP-CMP kinase binds the phosphodonor, usually ATP, and the NMP at different binding sites. The reaction results from an in-line phosphotransfer from the donor to the acceptor. The probe for the donor site was displaced by the bisubstrate analogs of the Ap5X series (where X = U, dT, A, G), indicating the broad specificity of the acceptor site. Both CMP and dCMP were competitors for the acceptor site probe. To find antimetabolites for antivirus and anticancer therapies, we have developed a method of screening acyclic phosphonate analogs that is based on the affinity of the acceptor-binding site of the human UMP-CMP kinase. Several uracil vinylphosphonate derivatives had affinities for human UMP-CMP kinase similar to those of dUMP and dCMP and better than that of cidofovir, an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate with a broad spectrum of antiviral activities. The uracil derivatives were inhibitors rather than substrates of human UMP-CMP kinase. Also, the 5-halogen-substituted analogs inhibited the human TMP kinase less efficiently. The broad specificity of the enzyme acceptor-binding site is in agreement with a large substrate-binding pocket, as shown by the 2.1 A crystal structure.

26040009|t|A simple and highly sensitive method of measuring heme oxygenase activity.
26040009|a|Heme oxygenase (HO) is a rate-limiting step of heme degradation, which catalyzes the conversion of heme into biliverdin, iron, and CO. HO has been characterized in microorganisms, insects, plants, and mammals. Previously used assays of HO activity were complicated and had low sensitivity. We found that the use of an eel bilirubin-bound fluorescent protein, UnaG, can achieve a highly sensitive and simple assay of HO activity. Using several enzyme sources including human culture cells, homogenates of plant tissues, and recombinant yeast HO, data were successfully obtained. The present method can facilitate the examination of HO in various organisms.

8981211|t|Ischemic preconditioning enhances donor lung preservation in the rat.
8981211|a|BACKGROUND: Ischemic preconditioning achieved by brief periods of ischemia and reperfusion before a prolonged period of ischemia can significantly reduce the extent of cardiac damage in many mammalian species and human beings. In this study we used a rat model of single lung transplantation to show that ischemic preconditioning also occurs in the lung. METHODS: Rats randomly selected for ischemic preconditioning had their left main bronchus and pulmonary artery occluded for 5 minutes, followed by 10 minutes of reperfusion and ventilation. Lungs of control rats were ventilated for 15 minutes. The lungs were perfused with University of Wisconsin solution, then heart and lungs were excised en bloc and stored in University of Wisconsin solution at 0 degree C for 6 or 12 hours. After left pneumonectomy, the left lung of the donor was then implanted into the recipient via left thoracotomy. After 1 hour of ventilation and reperfusion, a right pneumonectomy was performed making the animal completely dependent on the transplanted lung. Samples of arterial blood from the left ventricle were then taken for arterial oxygen tension and arterial carbon dioxide tension determination. Water contents of the donor lungs were measured before and after reperfusion. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances were measured in the right donor lung after storage. RESULTS: Lungs transplanted after 12 hours of storage had profoundly impaired gas exchange (arterial oxygen tension = 34 +/- 5; arterial carbon dioxide tension = 69 +/- 7 mm Hg) compared with the normal levels in the 6-hour storage group (arterial oxygen tension = 308 +/- 22; arterial carbon dioxide tension = 17 +/- 1 mm Hg). Ischemic preconditioning significantly improved gas exchange in the 12-hour storage group (arterial oxygen tension = 83 +/- 11; arterial carbon dioxide tension = 40 +/- 4 mm Hg). Ischemic preconditioning also significantly decreased thiobarbituric acid reactive substances formation at both 6- and 12-hour storage. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the phenomenon of ischemic preconditioning occurs in the lung and that it may reduce injury to the donor lung during prolonged cold ischemic storage.

19438290|a|Nox family NADPH oxidases serve a variety of functions requiring reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, including antimicrobial defense, biosynthetic processes, oxygen sensing, and redox-based cellular signaling. We explored targeting, assembly, and activation of several Nox family oxidases, since ROS production appears to be regulated both spatially and temporally. Nox1 and Nox3 are similar to the phagocytic (Nox2-based) oxidase, functioning as multicomponent superoxide-generating enzymes. Factors regulating their activities include cytosolic activator and organizer proteins and GTP-Rac. Their regulation varies, with the following rank order: Nox2 > Nox1 > Nox3. Determinants of subcellular targeting include: (a) formation of Nox-p22(phox) heterodimeric complexes allowing plasma membrane translocation, (b) phospholipids-binding specificities of PX domain-containing organizer proteins (p47(phox) or Nox organizer 1 (Noxo1 and p40(phox)), and (c) variably splicing of Noxo1 PX domains directing them to nuclear or plasma membranes. Dual oxidases (Duox1 and Duox2) are targeted by different mechanisms. Plasma membrane targeting results in H(2)O(2) release, not superoxide, to support extracellular peroxidases. Human Duox1 and Duox2 have no demonstrable peroxidase activity, despite their extensive homology with heme peroxidases. The dual oxidases were reconstituted by Duox activator 2 (Duoxa2) or two Duoxa1 variants, which dictate maturation, subcellular localization, and the type of ROS generated by forming stable complexes with Duox.

9765359|t|Microsomal metabolism of delavirdine: evidence for mechanism-based inactivation of human cytochrome P450 3A.
9765359|a|Administration of delavirdine, an HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor, to rats or monkeys resulted in apparent loss of hepatic microsomal CYP3A and delavirdine desalkylation activity. Human CYP3A catalyzes the formation of desalkyl delavirdine and 6'-hydroxy delavirdine, an unstable metabolite, while CYP2D6 catalyzes only desalkyl delavirdine. CYP2D6 catalyzed desalkyl delavirdine formation was linear with time (up to 30 min) but when catalyzed by cDNA expressed CYP3A4 or human liver microsomes the reaction rate declined progressively with time. Coincubation with triazolam showed that delavirdine caused a time- and NADPH-dependent loss of CYP3A4 activity in human liver microsomes as measured by triazolam 1'-hydroxylation. The catalytic activity loss was saturable and was characterized by a Ki of 21.6 +/- 8.9 microM and a kinact of 0.59 +/- 0.08 min-1. An apparent partition ratio of 41 was determined with cDNA expressed CYP3A4, based on the substrate depletion method. Incubation of [14C]delavirdine with microsomes from several species resulted in irreversible association with an approximately 50 kDa protein, as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE/autoradiography. Binding to the protein was NADPH dependent, glutathione insensitive, proportional to the level of CYP3A expression and was inhibited by ketoconazole, a specific CYP3A inhibitor. NADPH-dependent irreversible binding to human and rat total microsomal protein was demonstrated following exhaustive extraction of microsomal protein. Binding was decreased in the presence of glutathione and appeared to be related to expression level of CYP3A. These results suggest that delavirdine can inactivate CYP3A and has the potential to slow the metabolism of coadministered CYP3A substrates.

3858610|t|The role of platelet-derived growth factor on human pluripotent progenitor (CFU-GEMM) growth in vitro.
3858610|a|The effect of serum on the proliferation of human bone marrow pluripotent progenitor cells (CFU-GEMM), was compared to that of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Serum significantly increased the number of mixed erythroid-granulocytic-megakaryocytic colonies (CFU-GEMM) and erythrocytic bursts (BFU-E) in this assay system (p less than 0.01 and 0.02, respectively). Two possible explanations for this finding were considered: first the presence of citrate-phosphate-dextrose (CPD) in plasma but not in serum, and second the presence of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in serum but not in plasma. CPD was indeed found to have an inhibitory effect on growth of colonies of all types when added to serum-stimulated cultures. Nevertheless, when heparinized plasma was compared to serum from the same donors, growth of CFU-GEMM and BFU-E was higher in the serum-stimulated cultures (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.05, respectively). PDGF at concentrations of 120-240 pM was found to enhance the formation of CFU-GEMM and BFU-E by three- and four-fold respectively when added to cultures containing FFP but not when added to cultures containing serum derived from whole blood (WBS). Purified PDGF added at the same concentrations, to cultures containing platelet-poor derived serum (PDS), promoted similar increases in growth of CFU-GEMM and BFU-E but not of granulocytic-macrophage or megakaryocytic colonies. Whether PDGF has a direct action on CFU-GEMM or its growth promoting activity is via an interacting cell population is currently being studied.

19775596|t|Ethanol induces apoptosis in human mast cells.
19775596|a|AIMS: Alcohol abuse is associated with increased frequency of infections attributed to ethanol-induced immune suppression. The precise mechanism of immune suppression is however not known. Mast cells (MC) belong to the innate immune system and they have been implicated in the first line of immune defence against bacteria and parasites. Therefore we studied the effects of ethanol and its first metabolite acetaldehyde on mast cell viability, proliferation and apoptosis. MAIN METHODS: Human mast cell line (HMC)-1 cells, mouse bone marrow derived mast cells (mBMMC) and human peripheral blood derived mast cells (HuMC) were used. Effects of ethanol and acetaldehyde on mast cell proliferation were determined by assessing incorporation of [(3)H]thymidine into cellular DNA and by trypan blue exclusion. Apoptosis was assessed by measuring apoptotic nucleosomes and caspase-3, -8 and -9 activities using ELISA and by using Tunel assay. The expression of anti- and proapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bax was analyzed by RT-PCR and western blot, respectively. KEY FINDINGS: Ethanol, but not acetaldehyde inhibited dose-dependently the proliferation and viability HMC-1 and mBMMC cells. The decreased viability was caused by apoptotic cell death of the MC. Significant apoptosis of HMC-1 cells was observed in the presence of 43mM (2.5 per thousand) ethanol. Induction of apoptosis was associated with clearly increased caspase-3 activity and moderately increased caspase-8 and 9 activities. Ethanol also shifted the Bcl-2/Bax balance towards apoptosis. SIGNIFICANCE: The ethanol-induced reduction of MC viability could contribute to immunosuppression associated with ethanol abuse.

12841539|t|Antifertility effects of fluphenazine in adult male rats.
12841539|a|The underlying mechanisms in human infertility associated with hyperprolactinemia have yet to be established. Hyperprolactinemia is a known side-effect of fluphenazine, a broad spectrum, long-acting phenothiazine known to be D2 dopamine receptor antagonist. Dose-related effects of fluphenazine decanoate were ascertained on the fertility of 60-day treated, adult male rats. Significant increase in the serum levels of prolactin and decrease in the levels of LH and FSH were seen at doses of 1-3 mg/kg/day. No effect was evident on the serum testosterone (T) and estradiol. The tissue levels of Inhibins were not affected. The weights of testes, epididymides, seminal vesicles, ventral prostate, adrenal and pituitary glands were not affected. Testicular histology showed sloughing indicating the sensitivity of this parameter to FSH deficiency. Mating occurred within 10 days of cohabitation in the control and 1-2 mg/kg/day treated groups but delayed in the 3 mg/kg/day treated group with a significant effect on potency. Implantation sites, litter size and fertility index were significantly reduced at 2-3 mg/kg/day doses of fluphenazine. No effects however were seen on sperm counts or motility whereas morphological changes were apparent in the acrosome. Chromatin decondensation in vitro was enhanced and sperm chromatin structure assay revealed DNA denaturation. Hypothalamic tyrosine hydroxylase levels were increased in 1-3 mg/kg/day dose range. Hyperprolactinemic males sired fewer pups as compared to controls. Hypothalamic tyrosine hydroxylase was upregulated at all the doses. The antifertility effects of fluphenazine-induced hyperprolactinemia appeared to be unrelated to testosterone (T). In addition, FSH decrease might have affected the intrinsic sperm quality and thereby reduced litter size.

17496213|t|Vasomotor control in mice overexpressing human endothelial nitric oxide synthase.
17496213|a|Nitric oxide (NO) plays a key role in regulating vascular tone. Mice overexpressing endothelial NO synthase [eNOS-transgenic (Tg)] have a 20% lower systemic vascular resistance (SVR) than wild-type (WT) mice. However, because eNOS enzyme activity is 10 times higher in tissue homogenates from eNOS-Tg mice, this in vivo effect is relatively small. We hypothesized that the effect of eNOS overexpression is attenuated by alterations in NO signaling and/or altered contribution of other vasoregulatory pathways. In isoflurane-anesthetized open-chest mice, eNOS inhibition produced a significantly greater increase in SVR in eNOS-Tg mice compared with WT mice, consistent with increased NO synthesis. Vasodilation to sodium nitroprusside (SNP) was reduced, whereas the vasodilator responses to phosphodiesterase-5 blockade and 8-bromo-cGMP (8-Br-cGMP) were maintained in eNOS-Tg compared with WT mice, indicating blunted responsiveness of guanylyl cyclase to NO, which was supported by reduced guanylyl cyclase activity. There was no evidence of eNOS uncoupling, because scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced even less vasodilation in eNOS-Tg mice, whereas after eNOS inhibition the vasodilator response to ROS scavenging was similar in WT and eNOS-Tg mice. Interestingly, inhibition of other modulators of vascular tone [including cyclooxygenase, cytochrome P-450 2C9, endothelin, adenosine, and Ca-activated K(+) channels] did not significantly affect SVR in either eNOS-Tg or WT mice, whereas the marked vasoconstrictor responses to ATP-sensitive K(+) and voltage-dependent K(+) channel blockade were similar in WT and eNOS-Tg mice. In conclusion, the vasodilator effects of eNOS overexpression are attenuated by a blunted NO responsiveness, likely at the level of guanylyl cyclase, without evidence of eNOS uncoupling or adaptations in other vasoregulatory pathways.

23935672|a|In this study, we investigated the antioxidant activity and anti-photoaging properties of an extract of Flemingia macrophylla, a plant rich in isoflavonoid content. Pretreatment of fibroblasts with Flemingia macrophylla extract (FME) inhibited elastase activity, promoted the protein expression of type I procollagen, and attenuated the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and the protein expression of matrix-metalloproteinase- (MMP-) 1, 3, and 9. The IC50 values were 2.1  μ g/mL for DPPH radical scavenging ability, 366.8  μ g/mL for superoxide anion scavenging ability, 178.9  μ g/mL for hydrogen peroxide scavenging ability, and 230.9  μ g/mL for hydroxyl radical scavenging ability. Also, exposure of erythrocytes to various concentrations of FME (50-500  μ g/mL) resulted in a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of AAPH-induced hemolysis. In human fibroblasts, FME at 10  μ g/mL was shown to be a potent scavenger of UV-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). The antioxidant and anti-photoaging properties of FME make it an ideal anti-intrinsic aging and anti-photoaging agent.

2604393|t|Transformation of Bacillus polymyxa with plasmid DNA.
2604393|a|A plasmid transformation system was developed for Bacillus polymyxa ATCC 12321 and derivatives of this strain. The method utilizes a penicillin-treated-cell technique to facilitate uptake of the plasmid DNA. Low-frequency transformation (10(-6) per recipient cell) of plasmids pC194, pBD64, and pBC16 was accomplished with this method. Selection for the transformants was accomplished on both hypertonic and nonhypertonic selective media, with the highest rates of recovery occurring on a peptone-glucose-yeast extract medium containing 0.25 M sucrose. Several additional plasmids were shown to be capable of transferring their antibiotic resistance phenotypes to B. polymyxa through the use of a protoplast transformation procedure which allowed for a more efficient transfer of the plasmid DNA. However, cell walls could not be regenerated on the transformed protoplasts, and the transformants could not be subcultured from the original selective media.

26823463|t|Structural Analysis of β-Fructofuranosidase from Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous Reveals Unique Features and the Crucial Role of N-Glycosylation in Oligomerization and Activity.
26823463|a|Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhousβ-fructofuranosidase (XdINV)is a highly glycosylated dimeric enzyme that hydrolyzes sucrose and releases fructose from various fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and fructans. It also catalyzes the synthesis of FOS, prebiotics that stimulate the growth of beneficial bacteria in human gut. In contrast to most fructosylating enzymes, XdINV produces neo-FOS, which makes it an interesting biotechnology target. We present here its three-dimensional structure, which shows the expected bimodular arrangement and also a long extension of its C terminus that together with anN-linked glycan mediate the formation of an unusual dimer. The two active sites of the dimer are connected by a long crevice, which might indicate its potential ability to accommodate branched fructans. This arrangement could be representative of a group of GH32 yeast enzymes having the traits observed in XdINV. The inactive D80A mutant was used to obtain complexes with relevant substrates and products, with their crystals structures showing at least four binding subsites at each active site. Moreover, two different positions are observed from subsite +2 depending on the substrate, and thus, a flexible loop (Glu-334-His-343) is essential in binding sucrose and β(2-1)-linked oligosaccharides. Conversely, β(2-6) and neo-type substrates are accommodated mainly by stacking to Trp-105, explaining the production of neokestose and the efficient fructosylating activity of XdINV on α-glucosides. The role of relevant residues has been investigated by mutagenesis and kinetics measurements, and a model for the transfructosylating reaction has been proposed. The plasticity of its active site makes XdINV a valuable and flexible biocatalyst to produce novel bioconjugates.

We sought to investigate the expression of the intermediate conductance calcium-activated potassium channel K(Ca)3.1 in HASM cells and investigate its role in proliferation. Smooth muscle cells derived from human airways were grown in vitro and K(Ca)3.1 channel expression was measured using Western blot, RT-PCR, and patch clamp electrophysiology. Pharmacologic inhibitors of the channel were used in assays of cellular proliferation, and flow cytometry was used to identify cell cycle regulation. HASM cells expressed K(Ca)3.1 channel mRNA, protein, and activity with up-regulation evident after transforming growth factor-beta stimulation. Pharmacologic inhibition of K(Ca)3.1 led to growth arrest in cells stimulated to proliferate with mitogens. These inhibitors did not cause cellular toxicity or induce apoptosis. We have demonstrated, for the first time, the expression of K(Ca)3.1 channels in HASM cells. In addition, we have shown that K(Ca)3.1 channels are important in HASM cell proliferation, making these channels a potential therapeutic target in airway remodeling.

24583585|t|[Central pontine myelinolysis developed during alcohol withdrawal in a chronic alcoholic with hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state].
24583585|a|We present a 46-year-old man with central pontine myelinolysis (CPM). He had been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and chronic pancreatitis. He had drunk more than 1.2 l of Japanese sake daily for 20 years and more. He developed slight reduction of consciousness, dysarthria and truncal ataxia 7 days after he stopped drinking. The laboratory data on admission showed hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, according to the following findings; glucose 1,058 mg/dl, serum osmolality 328 mOsm/l and serum sodium 119 mEq/l. According as administration of acetic Ringer's solution and insulin injection, the laboratory data 14 hours after admission showed glucose 235 mg/dl, serum osmolality 290 mOsm/l and serum sodium 131 mEq/l. The initial diffusion weighted images (DWI) on MRI revealed a small high signal intensity spot in the pons. The second DWI after 14 days revealed a trident-shaped hyperintensity in the pons that was compatible with CPM. His symptoms showed no remarkable changes, but susceptibility weighted images of MRI after 4 months revealed low signal intensity area in the CPM lesion that indicated pontine hemorrhage. We speculate that marked fluctuation of serum osmotic pressure associated with the rapid change of the serum glucose had a significant role in the pathogenesis of the present case. Therefore, we recommend gradual correction of serum glucose and serum osmolality to maintain less than 12 mEq/l/day as correction of chronic hyponatremia in to prevent and ameliorate pathologic condition of CPM.

21659698|t|Synthetical bone-like and biological hydroxyapatites: a comparative study of crystal structure and morphology.
21659698|a|Phase composition, crystal structure and morphology of biological hydroxyapatite (BHAp) extracted from human mandible bone, and carbonated hydroxyapatite (CHAp), synthesized by the chemical precipitation method, were studied by x-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman (R) spectroscopy techniques, combined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Structural and microstructural parameters were determined through Rietveld refinement of recorded XRD data, performed using the FullProf computing program, and TEM. Microstructural analysis shows anisotropic extension along the [00l] crystallographic direction (i.e. elongated crystallites shape) of both investigated samples. The average crystallite sizes of 10 and 8 nm were estimated for BHAp and CHAp, respectively. The FTIR and R spectroscopy studies show that carbonate ions substitute both phosphate and hydroxyl ions in the crystal structure of BHAp as well as in CHAp, indicating that both of them are mixed AB-type of CHAp. The thermal behaviour and carbonate content were analysed using thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis. The carbonate content of about 1 wt.% and phase transition, at near 790 °C, from HAp to β-tricalcium phosphate were determined in both samples. The quality of synthesized CHAp powder, particularly, the particle size distribution and uniformity of morphology, was analysed by a particle size analyser based on laser diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy, respectively. These data were used to discuss similarity between natural and synthetic CHAp. Good correlation between the unit cell parameters, average crystallite size, morphology, carbonate content and crystallographic positions of carbonate ions in natural and synthetic HAp samples was found.

25881551|t|The deleterious metabolic and genotoxic effects of the bacterial metabolite p-cresol on colonic epithelial cells.
25881551|a|p-Cresol that is produced by the intestinal microbiota from the amino acid tyrosine is found at millimolar concentrations in the human feces. The effects of this metabolite on colonic epithelial cells were tested in this study. Using the human colonic epithelial HT-29 Glc(-/+) cell line, we found that 0.8mM p-cresol inhibits cell proliferation, an effect concomitant with an accumulation of the cells in the S phase and with a slight increase of cell detachment without necrotic effect. At this concentration, p-cresol inhibited oxygen consumption in HT-29 Glc(-/+) cells. In rat normal colonocytes, p-cresol also inhibited respiration. Pretreatment of HT-29 Glc(-/+) cells with 0.8mM p-cresol for 1 day resulted in an increase of the state 3 oxygen consumption and of the cell maximal respiratory capacity with concomitant increased anion superoxide production. At higher concentrations (1.6 and 3.2mM), p-cresol showed similar effects but additionally increased after 1 day the proton leak through the inner mitochondrial membrane, decreasing the mitochondrial bioenergetic activity. At these concentrations, p-cresol was found to be genotoxic toward HT-29 Glc(-/+) and also LS-174T intestinal cells. Lastly, a decreased ATP intracellular content was observed after 3 days treatment. p-Cresol at 0.8mM concentration inhibits colonocyte respiration and proliferation. In response, cells can mobilize their "respiratory reserve." At higher concentrations, p-cresol pretreatment uncouples cell respiration and ATP synthesis, increases DNA damage, and finally decreases the ATP cell content. Thus, we have identified p-cresol as a metabolic troublemaker and as a genotoxic agent toward colonocytes.

15630224|t|The regulation and function of phosphate in the human body.
15630224|a|Inorganic phosphate (Pi) is required for cellular function and skeletal mineralization. Serum Pi level is maintained within a narrow range through a complex interplay between intestinal absorption, exchange with intracellular and bone storage pools, and renal tubular reabsorption. Pi is abundant in the diet, and intestinal absorption of Pi is efficient and minimally regulated. The kidney is a major regulator of Pi homeostasis and can increase or decrease its Pi reabsorptive capacity to accommodate Pi need. The crucial regulated step in Pi homeostasis is the transport of Pi across the renal proximal tubule. Type II sodium-dependent phosphate (Na/Pi) cotransporter (NPT2) is the major molecule in the renal proximal tubule and is regulated by hormones and nonhormonal factors. Recent studies of inherited and acquired hypophosphatemia which exhibit similar biochemical and clinical features, have led to the identification of novel genes, phosphate regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X chromosome (PHEX) and fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), that play a role in the regulation of Pi homeostasis. The PHEX gene encodes an endopeptidase, predominantly expressed in bone and teeth but not in kidney. FGF-23 may be a substrate of this endopeptidase and inhibit renal Pi reabsorption. In a survey in the United States and in Japan, the amount of phosphorus from food is gradually increasing. It is thought that excess amounts of phosphorus intake for long periods are a strong factor in bone impairment and ageing. The restriction of phosphorus intake seems to be important under low calcium intake to keep QOL on high level.

29106511|t|Enhanced sodium acetate tolerance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by the Thr255Ala mutation of the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5.
29106511|a|Sodium and acetate inhibit cell growth and ethanol fermentation by different mechanisms in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We identified the substitution of a conserved Thr255 to Ala (T255A) in the essential Nedd4-family ubiquitin ligase Rsp5, which enhances cellular sodium acetate tolerance. The T255A mutation selectively increased the resistance of cells against sodium acetate, suggesting that S. cerevisiae cells possess an Rsp5-mediated mechanism to cope with the composite stress of sodium and acetate. The sodium acetate tolerance was dependent on the extrusion of intracellular sodium ions by the plasma membrane-localized sodium pumps Ena1, Ena2, and Ena5 (Ena1/2/5) and two known upstream regulators: the Rim101 pH signaling pathway and the Hog1 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). However, the T255A mutation affected neither the ubiquitination level of the Rsp5 adaptor protein Rim8 nor the phosphorylation level of Hog1. These data raised the possibility that Rsp5 enhances the function of Ena1/2/5 specifically in response to sodium acetate through an unknown mechanism other than ubiquitination of Rim8 and activation of Hog1-mediated signaling. Also, an industrial yeast strain that expresses the T255A variant exhibited increased initial fermentation rates in the presence of sodium acetate. Hence this mutation has potential for the improvement of bioethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass.

7720336|t|L-arginine increases exhaled nitric oxide in normal human subjects.
7720336|a|1. Endogenous nitric oxide plays an important physiological role and is synthesized by several isoforms of nitric oxide synthase from the semiessential amino acid L-arginine. Nitric oxide is detectable in the exhaled air of normal individuals and may be used to monitor the formation of nitric oxide in the respiratory tract. 2. We have investigated the effect of orally administered L-arginine (0.05, 0.1, 0.2 g/kg) compared with matched placebo on the concentration of nitric oxide in the exhaled air in 23 normal individuals. 3. L-Arginine caused significant increases in the concentration of nitric oxide in exhaled air at doses of 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg, which was maximal 2 h after administration. This was associated with an increase in the concentration of L-arginine and nitrate in plasma. There were no significant changes in heart rate, blood pressure or forced expiratory volume in 1 s. 4. These results suggest that an increase in the amount of substrate for nitric oxide synthase can increase the formation of endogenous nitric oxide. This may have therapeutic relevance in diseases in which there is defective production of nitric oxide.

8342008|t|[Sports anthropological knowledge of relationships between individual hormone levels and anthropometric measuring values].
8342008|a|As a tentative investigation of morpho-endocrinology, 92 male and 18 female long-distance runners (ages 21 to 72) were measured according to the standard anthropological techniques. 66 anthropometric parameters, the colours of hair and eyes were recorded. Seven growth factors were derived by means of factor analysis. The levels of 13 hormones were measured and morphological and endocrinological parameters were compared by means of correlation coefficients. So human growth hormone showed correlations to macrosomia and hyperplastic robustness. Estradiol was primarily related to the more feminine features of men, but also to leanness and slenderness of women. Testosterone exhibited significant correlations to mesomorphy and masculinity of males and leptomorphism and strength of females. Both sexes with higher insulin levels seemed to be more fat. Thyroxine (T4) showed a relation to endomorphy and leptomorphism of face, whereas Triiodothyronine (T3) exhibited correlations to ectomorphy. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was paralleling mesomorphy of males and hyperplastic robustness of females. Luteinizing hormone (LH), Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and Prolactin were related to microsomia and hypoplasia. The T4 levels of the dark-haired athletes were significantly higher than the levels of the bright-haired. Several correlations between morphology and hormonal status have been shown, which may be interpreted as a permanent endocrine constitution paralleling the somatotypical body shape, outlasting growth. These correlations however should not be interpreted as causal, as further experimental studies are needed to ascertain such a link.

22222374|t|PrPC displays an essential protective role from oxidative stress in an astrocyte cell line derived from PrPC knockout mice.
22222374|a|The PrP(C) protein, which is especially present in the cellular membrane of nervous system cells, has been extensively studied for its controversial antioxidant activity. In this study, we elucidated the free radical scavenger activity of purified murine PrP(C) in solution and its participation as a cell protector in astrocytes that were subjected to treatment with an oxidant. In vitro and using an EPR spin-trapping technique, we observed that PrP(C) decreased the oxidation of the DMPO trap in a Fenton reaction system (Cu(2+)/ascorbate/H(2)O(2)), which was demonstrated by approximately 70% less DMPO/OH(). In cultured PrP(C)-knockout astrocytes from mice, the absence of PrP(C) caused an increase in intracellular ROS (reactive oxygen species) generation during the first 3h of H(2)O(2) treatment. This rapid increase in ROS disrupted the cell cycle in the PrP(C)-knockout astrocytes, which increased the population of cells in the sub-G1 phase when compared with cultured wild-type astrocytes. We conclude that PrP(C) in solution acts as a radical scavenger, and in astrocytes, it is essential for protection from oxidative stress caused by an external chemical agent, which is a likely condition in human neurodegenerative CNS disorders and pathological conditions such as ischemia.

9151873|t|Open reading frame 26 of human herpesvirus 8 encodes a tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate- and butyrate-inducible 32-kilodalton protein expressed in a body cavity-based lymphoma cell line.
9151873|a|DNA sequences corresponding to a novel herpesvirus (human herpesvirus 8 [HHV8]) are associated with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), Castleman's disease, and body cavity-based lymphomas (BCBL). Studies of a BCBL-derived cell line suggest a direct correlation between seropositivity against antigens specifically present in such lines and the development of KS. We have generated recombinant proteins corresponding to open reading frame (ORF) 26 of HHV8 and have produced affinity-purified antibodies. Using these antibodies, we studied the expression of HHV8 ORF26 in a BCBL-derived cell line and found that it encodes a cytoplasmic protein whose expression is induced 16-fold by treatment with phorbol ester or sodium butyrate. This protein induction correlates with a significant induction of viral RNA transcripts. Interestingly, under our experimental conditions minimal increases in viral DNA were observed. No antibodies to the ORF26 protein of HHV8 were found in the sera from two human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients with KS as determined by immunoprecipitation analysis. However, antibodies in the sera from the two KS patients immunoprecipitated a 34-kDa protein found in extracts from induced BCBL1 cells that was not recognized by the control sera.

9568691|t|Evidence for involvement of the proteasome complex (26S) and NFkappaB in IL-1beta-induced nitric oxide and prostaglandin production by rat islets and RINm5F cells.
9568691|a|Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) has been implicated as an effector molecule of beta-cell destruction in autoimmune diabetes. IL-1beta inhibits insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells by stimulating the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) that generates the free radical nitric oxide. IL-1beta also induces the coexpression of the inducible isoform of cyclooxygenase (COX-2) that results in the overproduction of proinflammatory prostaglandins. The current studies were designed to characterize the involvement of protease(s) in the signaling pathway of IL-1beta-induced iNOS and COX-2 expression by rat islets and transformed rat pancreatic beta-cells. Because of the limitations of cell numbers of purified primary beta-cells obtained from rat islets, biochemical and molecular studies were performed using the rat insulinoma beta-cell line RINm5F. A serine protease inhibitor, Nalpha-P-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), and a proteasome complex (26S) inhibitor, MG 132, inhibited IL-1beta-induced nitrite formation, an oxidation product of nitric oxide produced by iNOS, in a concentration-dependent manner, with complete inhibition observed at 100 micromol/l and 10 micromol/l, respectively. Both TLCK and MG 132 also inhibited iNOS gene expression at the level of mRNA and protein. In an analogous manner, TLCK (100 micromol/l) and MG 132 (10 micromol/l) inhibited IL-1beta-induced COX-2 enzyme activity (PGE2 formation) and COX-2 gene expression at the level of mRNA and protein. In human islets, the proteasome inhibitor MG 132 also inhibited the formation of the products of iNOS and COX-2 enzyme activity, nitrite, and PGE2, respectively. These findings suggest that the inhibitory action of TLCK and MG 132 on iNOS and COX-2 expression precedes transcription. The transcription factor NFkappaB is essential for activation of a number of cytokine-inducible enzymes and was evaluated as a possible site of protease action necessary for IL-1beta-induced coexpression of iNOS and COX-2. TLCK and MG 132 inhibited both IL-1beta-induced activation of NFkappaB and degradation of IkappaBalpha by islets and RINm5F cells. These results implicate protease activation as an early signaling event in IL-1beta-induced inhibition of beta-cell function. This study also suggests that IL-1beta-induced iNOS and COX-2 coexpression by pancreatic beta-cells share a common signaling pathway in utilizing the proteasome complex (26S) and the transcription factor NFkappaB, and it identifies sites of intervention to prevent the overproduction of their inflammatory products.

3405240|t|Carnitine stimulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) in isolated human skeletal muscle mitochondria.
3405240|a|L-carnitine stimulated CO2 production from 1-14C pyruvate in mitochondria from human skeletal muscle nearly twofold. A comparable increase in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) activity was seen. Moreover, in the presence of L-carnitine and at pyruvate concentration greater than 0.25 mM, this effect was associated with a marked increase of acetylcarnitine synthesis. Deoxycarnitine, an inhibitor of carnitine acetyltransferase (CAT), partially reversed the effect of carnitine on PDHC activity. The stimulatory effect of carnitine on PDHC activity in human mitochondria is mediated by the modulation of the intramitochondrial acetyl-CoA/CoASH ratio.

28338196|t|Study on the proliferation of human gastric cancer cell AGS by activation of EGFR in H2O2.
28338196|a|OBJECTIVE: This study is to investigate the effect of low concentration hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on the proliferation of gastric cancer AGS cell line in vitro and the mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AGS cells were treated with different low concentrations of H2O2 (1, 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001 μm) for 48 hours. The effect of H2O2 concentration gradient on the activity of AGS cell activities was detected by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) method. The expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its downstream signaling pathway extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) protein in H2O2 was detected by Western blot method; moreover, the effect of H2O2 on intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in AGS cells was observed under the fluorescence microscope and quantitative analysis by flow cytometry. The effect of H2O2 on the level of c-myc mRNA in AGS cells was also detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: MTT detection results showed that 1 μm and 0.1 μm H2O2 at 48h can effectively promote the proliferation of AGS cells (p<0.05). The Western blot results showed that after 48 hours of low concentration of H2O2 treatment of AGS cells, the EGFR protein levels and ERK protein phosphorylation levels increased significantly (p<0.05). Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry showed that the low concentration of H2O2 increased the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). RT-PCR results showed the levels of c-myc mRNA in AGS cells treated with a low concentration of H2O2 were significantly increased (p<0.05) and EGFR blocking agent AG1478 can resist the above effects. CONCLUSIONS: Low concentration of H2O2 can significantly promote the proliferation of AGS cells by activating EGFR/ERK signaling pathway.

9873458|a|The design and synthesis of potential antitumor antimetabolites 2'-deoxy-2'-hydroxylaminouridine (2'-DHAU) and -cytidine (2'-DHAC) are described. We found that 2'-DHAC in neutral solution generated 2'-aminoxy radicals at room temperature. 2'-DHAC inhibited the growth of L1210 and KB cells, with IC50 values of 1.58 and 1.99 microM, respectively, more potently than 2'-DHAU, with IC50 values of 34.5 and 27.3 microM, respectively. 2'-DHAC was effective against 9 human cell lines, with IC50 values of in the micromolar range. The in vivo antitumor activity of 2'-DHAC was also examined using the mouse leukemia P388 model, which gave a T/C value 167%. Phosphorylation of 2'-DHAC by uridine/cytidine kinase was essential for its cytotoxicity, as suggested by a competition experiment using several common nucleosides. Inhibition of DNA synthesis was the predominant mechanism of action of 2'-DHAC, although it has a ribo-configuration.

1882465|a|Anticoenzyme action of new derivatives of thiamine: oxodihydrothiochrome and its mono- and diphosphoric esters has been studied in the experiments on mice. It is shown that the given compounds exert an inhibiting action on transketolase and pyruvate dehydrogenase and do not change activity of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase in the animal organism. Antivitamin effect of the studied inhibitors is observed with the lower doses and in the earlier terms as compared with the other known inhibitors of thiamine-diphosphate-dependent enzymes. The preparations inhibit activity of the yeast pyruvate-decarboxylase by the mixed (with respect to thiamine-diphosphate) type (Ki for oxodihydrothiochrome and its mono- and diphosphoric esters: 2.3 x 10(-3), 7.2 x 10(-4), 5.6 x 10(-5) M, respectively).

24372662|t|Extrahepatic effects of nucleoside and nucleotide analogues in chronic hepatitis B treatment.
24372662|a|Oral nucleoside/nucleotide analogues (NAs) are the mainstay of therapy for patients with chronic hepatitis B and are generally well tolerated. Despite this, the safety profile of NAs is of paramount importance since the majority of patients will require long-term treatment. All NAs can potentially affect human DNA polymerase with decrease in mitochondrial DNA, leading to manifestations of mitochondrial toxicity. As a class effect, therefore, NAs can potentially cause extrahepatic conditions, such as myopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and lactic acidosis. Indeed, effects on muscles, including myopathy and creatine kinase elevations, have been described with clevudine and telbivudine use. Both adefovir and tenofovir are associated with dose-dependent nephropathy, predominantly affecting the proximal renal tubules. Neuropathy appears to be rare, and most commonly reported in patients receiving combination therapy with telbivudine and interferon. Increased risk of lactic acidosis has also been described for those with impaired liver and renal function taking entecavir. Loss of bone mineral density and hypophosphatemia have been described with the use of NAs, although the overwhelming studies have been with human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. However, not all extrahepatic effects are detrimental. Recent evidence has suggested a potential renal beneficial effect with the use of telbivudine. The effect of NAs on pregnancy appears to be minimal for all NAs, with telbivudine and tenofovir having a more favorable category B rating. Ongoing pharmacovigilance is essential to identify new and monitor existing extrahepatic effects associated with NA use.

11435505|t|Carnitine alters binding of aflatoxin to DNA and proteins in rat hepatocytes and cell-free systems.
11435505|a|The objective of this study was to determine effects of L-carnitine on aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1))-DNA adduct formation in isolated rat hepatocytes, its dose response, specificity and mode of action. All experiments were conducted in either freshly isolated rat hepatocytes or cell-free systems. There was negative linear correlation between the dosage of carnitine and formation of [(3)H]AFB(1)-DNA adducts in the hepatocytes; however, the partitioning of AFB(1) into cellular compartments was not affected by carnitine. The attenuating effect of carnitine on AFB(1)-DNA adduct formation was also present in a cell-free system, but there was lack of specificity because acetylcarnitine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were equally effective. Carnitine appears to interfere with bioactivation of AFB(1) and binding of AFB(1)-epoxide to DNA. On the contrary, carnitine enhanced the binding of AFB(1) and its epoxide to microsomal proteins, plasma proteins and bovine serum albumin. These results indicate that carnitine diverts AFB(1)-epoxide away from DNA by promoting binding to proteins. We conclude that modulation of AFB(1) binding to proteins and DNA by carnitine alters the carcinogenic and hepatotoxic potential of AFB(1) and poses concerns about the human AFB(1)-exposure data based on the AFB(1)-albumin adduct concentrations as a biomarker.

Smu1 is a p21-activated protein kinase (PAK) with roles in both the mating response required for the former function, as well as for the nutrient response. Hsl7 may be a negative regulator of Smu1 and appears to play a role in cell length and cell cycle. Additional proteins that participate in cell polarity and filamentation pathways include the small G protein, Rac1, and its effector PAK kinase, Cla4. Here we describe further experiments that explore the roles of Cla4 and Rac1 in the response to nitrogen availability. While deletion of rac1severely delays filamentous growth on solid media low in ammonium (SLAD), we found that deletion of cla4 does not abolish filamentous cell morphology on solid SLAD. Unexpectedly, however, the Dcla4 mutants also filament in liquid SLAD. The filamentous cell morphology of the cla4 mutant in liquid SLAD has only been seen previously for one other mutant, a strain deleted for hsl7 that simultaneously over-expresses smu1.

25748424|t|Role of the MAPK pathway in the observed bystander effect in lymphocytes co-cultured with macrophages irradiated with γ-rays or carbon ions.
25748424|a|AIMS: The radiation-induced bystander effect (RIBE) has potential implications in cancer risks from space particle radiation; however, the mechanisms underlying RIBE are unclear. The role of the MAPK pathway in the RIBEs of different linear energy transfer (LET) was investigated. MAIN METHODS: Human macrophage U937 cells were irradiated with γ-rays or carbon ions and then co-cultured with nonirradiated HMy2.CIR (HMy) lymphocytes for different periods. The activation of MAPK proteins and the generation of intracellular nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the irradiated U937 cells were measured. Micronuclei (MN) formation in the HMy cells was applied to evaluate the bystander damage. Some U937 cells were pretreated with different MAPK inhibitors before irradiation. KEY FINDINGS: Additional MN formation was induced in the HMy cells after co-culturing with irradiated U937 cells, and the yield of this bystander MN formation was dependent on the co-culture period with γ-ray irradiation but remained high after 1h of co-culture with carbon irradiation. Further investigations disclosed that the time response of the RIBEs had a relationship with LET, where ERK played a different role from JNK and p38 in regulating RIBEs by regulating the generation of the bystander signaling factors NO and ROS. SIGNIFICANCE: The finding that the RIBE of high-LET radiation could persist for a much longer period than that of γ-rays implies that particle radiation during space flight could have a high risk of long-term harmful effects. An appropriate intervention targeting the MAPK pathway may have significant implications in reducing this risk.

8861865|t|Kinetics and regulation of erythrogenic toxins type A and C during growth of Streptococcus pyogenes.
8861865|a|The production of erythrogenic toxins type A (ETA) and C (ETC) is described as a function of growth kinetics. Group A streptococcal strains C 203 S and NY 5 were cultivated in yeast-peptone extract, Todd-Hewitt medium and a synthetic medium. Two main growth phases occurred during growth: a first logarithmic phase and a second linear phase. These phases were separated by a short stationary interphase caused by limitation of the amino acids L-serine and L-leucine. Maximum production of ETC was observed during the logarithmic phase, it was correlated to a high level of viable cells. ETA was produced mainly during the short stationary interphase. The production of ETC is regulated by L-isoleucine. A stagnation or reduction of the concentration of viable cells was observed during the interphase. The phosphate limitation caused during streptococcal growth induced expression of the extracellular protein phosphatase and surprisingly, of a serine proteinase activity. The association between these results and the pathogenicity of streptococci is discussed.

19293360|t|HPMCs induce greater intercellular delocalization of tight junction-associated proteins due to a higher susceptibility to H2O2 compared with HUVECs.
19293360|a|BACKGROUND: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been speculated as possible inducers of structural or functional changes that lead to a hyperpermeable state in patients on long-term peritoneal dialysis. This study aimed to compare localization of tight junction-associated proteins (TJPs), which relate to solute permeability characteristics, between human peritoneal mesothelial cell (HPMC) monolayers and human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) monolayers under oxidative stress. METHODS: HPMCs and HUVECs were cultured on a polymer mesh until transepithelial electrical resistance reached a plateau. Solute permeation tests were conducted using FITC-labeled dextrans. Localization of TJPs was observed under a confocal laser scanning microscope. These experiments were carried out with/without 0.1 mmol/L H(2)O(2). In addition, ROS production as well as the amounts of intracellular reductive glutathione (GSH) and oxidative glutathione were measured. RESULTS: When the monolayers were exposed to 0.1 mmol/L H(2)O(2)/medium for 2 hours, the HPMC monolayer revealed a significant reduction in transepithelial electrical resistance (from 32.5 +/- 3.4 to 17.4 +/- 4.9 Omega.cm(2)) with delocalization of TJPs, particularly occludins. The HUVEC monolayer remained stable and exhibited an unremarkable change in TJP organization. Compared to the HUVEC monolayer, the HPMC monolayer exhibited two- to threefold higher 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein intensities that increased in a dose-dependent manner. HUVECs contained approximately 2.5-times more GSH than HPMCs. This supported the lesser production of ROS when exposed to 0.1 mmol/L H(2)O(2) for 24 hours. HUVECs used 8.03 nmol/mg GSH protein to maintain TJP localization, while only 3.75 nmol/mg GSH protein was available for the HPMCs. CONCLUSION: The HUVEC monolayer, which was less permeable to middle-to-high molecular weight solutes, was more tolerant against ROS stress than the HPMC monolayer. Availability of intracellular GSH is an important issue in maintaining the integrity of the mesothelium.

12682431|t|Induction of interleukin-6 by coal containing bioavailable iron is through both hydroxyl radical and ferryl species.
12682431|a|Coal mining causes health problems, such as pneumoconiosis. We have previously shown that prevalence of pneumoconiosis in workers from various coalmine regions positively correlates with levels of bioavailable iron (BAI) in the coals from that region. In the present study, the nature of reactive oxygen species formed by BAI in the coals and its mechanisms of the induction of biological responses were investigated. Human lung epithelial cell line, A549 cells, were used to examine the induction of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, which is known to play a crucial role in the development of pneumoconiosis. We found that levels of IL-6 protein as well as its mRNA were significantly increased in the cells treated for 24 h with 20 microg/cm2 of the BAI-containing Pennsylvania (PA) coal; for example we observed 6.7-fold increase in IL-6 protein. Levels of IL-6 protein in cells treated with the Utah (UT) coal containing low-BAI were only 1.9-fold of the control levels. The enhancing effect on the IL-6 by the PA coal was similar to that caused by hydrogen peroxide. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) all had inhibitory effects on the PA coal-induced IL-6 formation. However, CAT had the least protective effect as compared to SOD and NAC. Our results indicate that BAI in the PA coal may induce IL-6 through both ferryl species (via iron autoxidation) and hydroxyl radicals (via the Fenton/Haber Weiss reactions).

8843104|t|Pyramidal neurones in pathological human motor cortex express nitric oxide synthase.
8843104|a|The enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase (NADPH diaphorase) is widely used as a sensitive marker for indicating the presence of nitric oxide synthase in neurones. Pyramidal neurones in the healthy neocortex do not contain detectable levels of nitric oxide synthase. However, in the precentral gyrus of brains showing pathological damage, a high proportion of Betz cells (11-50%) and some smaller pyramidal neurones contained low to moderate levels of NADPH diaphorase. They were located in layers V and VI and were present in a newborn baby, older children and elderly adults. Thus, under pathological conditions, some pyramidal neurones are apparently capable of synthesising nitric oxide and this may have a neuroprotective function.

2626670|t|[The development and disappearance of electrical current in frog heart injuries induced by suction electrodes].
2626670|a|Origin and extinction of current due to damage caused by suction electrode on frog heart was studied. By means of epicardial and intracellular leads it was found out that this demarcation current manifests itself only in a very limited space around the place of suction and does not differ from the current due to damage caused by restraint in the coronary bloodstream in hearts of warm-blooded or in myocardial infarction in man. Membrane depolarization degree is diminishing from the place of suction with all accompanying manifestations also in intracellular recordings. The main cause of these changes is the local raised concentration of extracellular potassium ions and the participation of sodium and calcium ions is also being considered. It was proved that this simple biological model of current due to damage is suitable for the study of some changes in electrical heart area and in this way depolarizing and repolarizing parts of the electrocardiogram also in the ischemic heart disease in man.

2574978|t|The influence of N2-O2 and He-O2 saturation diving on electroencephalogram of human bodies.
2574978|a|This paper reports the changes of the EEG of human bodies during saturation exposure at different depths to different mixed gases. The results of the research show that the most obvious on EEG was the appearance of diffused slow waves, usually theta waves of 4-7 times/s, and delta waves of 2-3 times/s within individual subjects. The EEG changes at 50 m were more obvious than those at 36.5 m. With the prolonging of time under high pressure, the EEG had some improvements, for instance, the slow waves decreased and the alpha waves increased. There was a certain relationship between these changes and the symptoms which appeared in the human body. The chief factor of the EEG changes is due to the effect of nitrogen narcosis during the oxygen-nitrogen diving experiment. In addition, carbon dioxide retention under the high pressure is also a factor of the EEG changes, because repeated inhaling of CO2-dense mixtures could aggravate the EEG changes and the reduction of carbon dioxide in humans by hyperventilation could improve abnormal EEGs. The main changes of the EEG during the helium-oxygen exposure at 302 m were the increase of theta waves, and even of delta waves, the decrease in alpha rhythm and the decline of amplitude of alpha waves. Increased theta index and decreased alpha index could be seen at the depth of 302 m. Under any of the above-mentioned pressure conditions when slow waves characteristic of abnormal changes appeared in the EEGs, the EEGs could be temporarily improved by photic stimulation, i.e. slow waves disappeared and alpha waves reappeared. When photic stimulation was over, alpha waves disappeared and slow waves reappeared. It was indicated that abnormal changes of the EEG under high pressure were a kind of temporary and reversible changes of the brain function.

22950683|t|Effect of germination temperatures on proteolysis of the gluten-free grains rice and buckwheat during malting and mashing.
22950683|a|This study examined the performance of rice and buckwheat when malted under various temperature conditions and for different lengths of time. The mashed malts produced from both rice and buckwheat contained a wide spectra of sugars and amino acids that are required for yeast fermentation, regardless of malting temperature. At the germination temperatures of 20, 25, and 30 °C used, production of reducing sugars and free amino nitrogen (FAN) followed similar patterns. This implies that temperature variations, experienced in different countries, will not have an adverse effect on the production and release of amino acids and sugars, required by yeast during fermentation, from these grains. Such consistency in the availability of yeast substrates is likely to reduce differences in processing when these malts are used for brewing. This study revealed that, while rice malt consistently produced more maltose than glucose, buckwheat malt gave several times more glucose than maltose, across all germination temperatures. Buckwheat malt also produced more soluble and free amino nitrogen than rice malt. Unlike sorghum, which has gained wide application in the brewing industry for the production of gluten-free beer, the use of rice and buckwheat is minimal. This study provides novel information regarding the potential of rice and buckwheat for brewing. Both followed similar patterns to sorghum, suggesting that they could play a similar role to sorghum in the brewing industry. Inclusion of rice and buckwheat as brewing raw materials will increase the availability of suitable materials for use in the production of gluten-free beer, potentially making it more sustainable, cheaper, and more widely available.

11210154|t|Plasma sample preparation by ultrafiltration for FTIR analysis.
11210154|a|Total body water (TBW) may be significantly altered with disease. Isotope dilution techniques, considered to be the "gold standard" methods for measuring TBW, are expensive, time consuming and require considerable expertise, especially during the sample preparatory phase. In this study, a new method, ultrafiltration (UF), was hypothesised to be an efficient alternative to vacuum sublimation (VS) in the preparation of plasma samples for Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) determination of TBW. Deuterium Oxide (D2O) concentrations were prepared in human plasma and subjected to both techniques. FTIR analysis was carried out on the resulting VS and UF solutions and on D2O concentrations in distilled water. The resulting absorbance values were then statistically compared. Urea concentrations prepared in D2O-containing plasma were also compared to "blank" plasma to investigate the effect of high plasma urea concentration on the resulting H2O/D2O mixture obtained during UF Paired t-tests showed that the VS plasma samples (p=0.003), but not the UF samples (p=0.9), were significantly different to D2O standards prepared in distilled water. While there was no evidence of an effect of urea on UF at low (0.4 g/L) D2O concentration, a marginal (p=0.04) effect occurred at a higher (1.6 g/L) D2O level. Throughput of samples was much more efficient with the UF technique. These findings indicate that the new UF method is an accurate, more efficient method of plasma sample preparation than the VS method in the FTIR determination of TBW.

26907264|t|Cloning and Characterization of a Flavonoid 3'-Hydroxylase Gene from Tea Plant (Camellia sinensis).
26907264|a|Tea leaves contain abundant flavan-3-ols, which include dihydroxylated and trihydroxylated catechins. Flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase (F3'H: EC 1.14.13.21) is one of the enzymes in the establishment of the hydroxylation pattern. A gene encoding F3'H, designated as CsF3'H, was isolated from Camellia sinensis with a homology-based cloning technique and deposited in the GenBank (GenBank ID: KT180309). Bioinformatic analysis revealed that CsF3'H was highly homologous with the characterized F3'Hs from other plant species. Four conserved cytochrome P450-featured motifs and three F3'H-specific conserved motifs were discovered in the protein sequence of CsF3'H. Enzymatic analysis of the heterologously expressed CsF3'H in yeast demonstrated that tea F3'H catalyzed the 3'-hydroxylation of naringenin, dihydrokaempferol and kaempferol. Apparent Km values for these substrates were 17.08, 143.64 and 68.06 μM, and their apparent Vmax values were 0.98, 0.19 and 0.44 pM·min(-1), respectively. Transcription level of CsF3'H in the new shoots, during tea seed germination was measured, along with that of other key genes for flavonoid biosynthesis using real-time PCR technique. The changes in 3',4'-flavan-3-ols, 3',4',5'-flavan-3-ols and flavan-3-ols, were consistent with the expression level of CsF3'H and other related genes in the leaves. In the study of nitrogen supply for the tea plant growth, our results showed the expression level of CsF3'H and all other tested genes increased in response to nitrogen depletion after 12 days of treatment, in agreement with a corresponding increase in 3',4'-catechins, 3',4',5'-catechins and flavan 3-ols content in the leaves. All these results suggest the importance of CsF3'H in the biosynthesis of 3',4'-catechins, 3',4',5'-catechins and flavan 3-ols in tea leaves.

16909228|t|Increased alpha-tocopherol content in soybean seed overexpressing the Perilla frutescens gamma-tocopherol methyltransferase gene.
16909228|a|Tocopherols, with antioxidant properties, are synthesized by photosynthetic organisms and play important roles in human and animal nutrition. In soybean, gamma-tocopherol, the biosynthetic precursor to alpha-tocopherol, is the predominant form found in the seed, whereas alpha-tocopherol is the most bioactive component. This suggests that the final step of the alpha-tocopherol biosynthetic pathway catalyzed by gamma-tocopherol methyltransferase (gamma-TMT) is limiting in soybean seed. Soybean oil is the major edible vegetable oil consumed, so manipulating the tocopherol biosynthetic pathway in soybean seed to convert tocopherols into more active alpha-tocopherol form could have significant health benefits. In order to increase the soybean seed alpha-tocopherol content, the gamma-TMT gene isolated from Perilla frutescens was overexpressed in soybean using a seed-specific promoter. One transgenic plant was recovered and the progeny was analyzed for two generations. Our results demonstrated that the seed-specific expression of the P. frutescens gamma-TMT gene resulted in a 10.4-fold increase in the alpha-tocopherol content and a 14.9-fold increase in the beta-tocopherol content in T2 seed. Given the relative contributions of different tocopherols to vitamin E activity, the activity in T2 seed was calculated to be 4.8-fold higher than in wild-type seed. In addition, the data obtained on lipid peroxidation indicates that alpha-tocopherol may have a role in preventing oxidative damage to lipid components during seed storage and seed germination. The increase in the alpha-tocopherol content in the soybean seed could have a potential to significantly increase the dietary intake of vitamin E.

31199|t|[Detection and properties of L-threonine-L-serine dehydratase in human liver].
31199|a|It has been shown that in liver extract of men deceased by different causes, L-threonine and L-serine dehydratase activities probably, belonging to only one enzyme--L-threonine-L-serine dehydratase--are found. Both activities and their ratios depend on K+ concentration both in the buffer used for enzyme extraction and in the reaction medium. Before extraction of active and stable forms of enzyme the liver is to homogenized in a buffer containing 0.15 M KCl. Both enzymatic activities have a pH-optimum at pH 9.6--10.0. It was shown that D-isomers of threonine and serine are not dehydratated and do not inhibit dehydratation of L-isomers. Studies of dependence of L-threonine and L-serine dehydratase reaction rates on temperature showed that at any temperature ranges the energy activation values are higher for the L-threonine dehydratase reaction than for the L-serine dehydratase reaction and that the ratio reaction rates for both reactions depends on temperature.

8626402|t|The chemistry and tumoricidal activity of nitric oxide/hydrogen peroxide and the implications to cell resistance/susceptibility.
8626402|a|The mechanism of cytotoxicity of the NO donor 3-morpholino-sydnonimine toward a human ovarian cancer cell line (OVCAR) was examined. It was found that the NO-mediated loss of cell viability was dependent on both NO and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Somewhat surprisingly, superoxide (O2) and its reaction product with NO, peroxynitrite (-OONO), did not appear to be di- rectly involved in the observed NO-mediated cytotoxicity against this cancer cell line. The toxicity of NO/H2O2 may be due to the production of a potent oxidant formed via a trace metal-, H202-, and NO-dependent process. Because the combination of NO and H2O2 was found to be particularly cytotoxic, the effect of NO on cellular defense mechanisms involving H2O2 degradation was investigated. It was found that NO was able to inhibit catalase activity but had no effect on the activity of the glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx)-glutathione reductase system. It might therefore be expected that cells that utilize primarily the GSHPx-glutathione reductase system for degrading H2O2 would be somewhat resistant to the cytotoxic effects of NO. Consistent with this idea, it was found that ebselen, a compound with GSHPx-like activity, was able to protect cells against NO toxicity. Also, lowering endogenous GSHPx activity via selenium depletion resulted in an increased susceptibility of the target cells to NO-mediated toxicity. Thus, a possible NO/H2O2/metal-mediated mechanism for cellular toxicity is presented as well as a possible explanation for cell resistance/susceptibility to this NO-initiated process.

21043698|t|Nitric Oxide (NO)-Platelet Interactions: Inhibition is Independent of the Prostanoid and ADP Pathways.
21043698|a|Effects of nitric oxide (NO) on thrombin-induced responses in gel-filtered, [(32)P] Pi-(pre) labeled platelets (GFP) were examined. NO did not alter the levels of (32)P-labeled polyphosphoinositides in unstimulated platelets and did not inhibit the forskolin-induced elevation of [(32)P]PIP (phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate), which indicates that NO does not concomitantly increase the level of cAMP in resting human platelets. In aspirinated platelets NO inhibited thrombin (0.05 U/ml)-induced formation of [(32)P]phosphatidic acid (PA), secretion of ATP + ADP from the dense granules and secretion of acid glycosidases in a dose-dependent manner. At 0.2 U/ml of thrombin NO still inhibited these responses, although to a lesser degree. In aspirinated platelets in the presence of creatine phosphate/creatine phosphokinase (CP/CPK) to remove secreted ADP, increasing concentrations of NO still produced strong inhibition of [(32)P] PA-formation and secretory responses.

7408901|t|Interactions of prostaglandin H2 and thromboxane A2 with human serum albumin.
7408901|a|The present report describes the interactions of human plasma proteins with the unstable endoperoxide, prostaglandin H2 and thromboxane A2, generated by incubation of platelets with prostaglandin H2 or arachidonic acid. It was found that both compounds reacted very rapidly with plasma proteins to form covalently bound derivatives. The major reacting plasma protein was human serum albumin. Depending on conditions, 20-40% of added prostaglandin H2 and 50-80% of generated thromboxane were bound to proteins. This reaction of both prostaglandin H2 and thromboxane A2 prevents their detection by classical analytical methods. The protein binding of thromboxane was more pH-sensitive than the binding of prostaglandin H2. The reactions cause reduced levels of both endoperoxide and thromboxane B2 in suspensions of washed platelets using human serum albumin as compared to buffer. It was also shown that the half-life of prostaglandin H2 was considerably reduced in the presence of albumin.

2532001|t|The influence of Streptococcus mutans on adhesion of Candida albicans to acrylic surfaces in vitro.
2532001|a|Adhesion of Candida albicans and Streptococcus mutans was studied by incubation of radiolabelled cells with acrylic test specimens in a chemically defined growth medium. Strep. mutans adhered firmly in the presence of sucrose, while C. albicans was only loosely attached to the acrylic in both glucose and sucrose media. Firm adhesion of C. albicans occurred when the yeast was incubated simultaneously with Strep. mutans, in the presence of sucrose. The adhesion of C. albicans was also stimulated by incubation with Strep. mutans culture supernatants. Adhesion was not affected by the presence of partially purified glucosyltransferase from Strep. mutans IB. Coaggregation between C. albicans and Strep. mutans upon growth in sucrose medium was observed by light and scanning electron microscopy. No coaggregation was observed in the presence of glucose.

3129507|t|Recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor down-regulates expression of IL-2 receptor on human mononuclear phagocytes by induction of prostaglandin E.
3129507|a|Recent studies have shown that normal human alveolar macrophages and blood monocytes, as well as HL-60 and U937 monocyte cell lines, newly express IL-2R after stimulation with rIFN-gamma or LPS. In addition, macrophages transiently express IL-2R in vivo during immunologically mediated diseases such as pulmonary sarcoidosis and allograft rejection. We therefore investigated in vitro factors that modulate macrophage expression of IL-2R. IL-2R were induced on normal alveolar macrophages, blood monocytes, and HL-60 cells using rIFN-gamma (24 to 48 h at 240 U/ml), and cells were cultured for an additional 12 to 24 h with rIL-2 (100 U/ml), recombinant granulocyte-macrophage CSF (rGM-CSF, 1000 U/ml), rGM-CSF plus indomethacin (2 X 10(-6) M), PGE2 (0.1 to 10 ng/ml), 1 X 10(-6) M levels of caffeine, theophylline, and dibutyryl cyclic AMP, or medium alone. IL-2R expression was quantitated by cell ELISA (HL-60 cells) or determined by immunoperoxidase staining (alveolar macrophages, blood monocytes, and HL-60 cells), using anti-Tac and other CD25 mAb. PGE production was assayed by RIA. We found greater than 95% of alveolar macrophages, monocytes, and HL-60 cells expressed IL-2R after rIFN-gamma treatment and remained IL-2R+ in the presence of IL-2R or medium alone. By comparison, greater than 95% of cells induced to express IL-2R became IL-2R- after addition of rGM-CSF, and the culture supernatants from GM-CSF-treated cells contained increased levels of PGE. This inhibition of macrophage IL-2R expression by rGM-CSF was blocked by indomethacin, and IL-2R+ macrophages became IL-2R- after addition of PGE2 alone. These findings indicate GM-CSF down-regulates IL-2R expression by human macrophages via induction of PGE synthesis. Moreover, a similar down-regulation of IL-2R expression was seen after stimulation with caffeine, theophylline, or dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Hence, GM-CSF, PGE, and other pharmacologic agents that act to increase intracellular levels of cAMP may play a modulatory role, antagonistic to that of IFN-gamma on cellular expression of IL-2R by human inflammatory macrophages in vivo.

8653881|t|Oxidized LDL decreases L-arginine uptake and nitric oxide synthase protein expression in human platelets: relevance of the effect of oxidized LDL on platelet function.
8653881|a|BACKGROUND: Oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) promotes vasoconstriction and platelet activation. The present study was undertaken to determine the involvement of the L-arginine-nitric oxide (NO) pathway in ox-LDL-mediated platelet activation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Washed human platelets were incubated with native LDL or ox-LDL for 1 hour at 37 degrees C followed by measurement of platelet function and indexes of the L-arginine-NO pathway. Ox-LDL but not native LDL caused a concentration-dependent increase in thrombin-induced platelet aggregation and 14C-serotonin release. These effects of ox-LDL were inhibited by pretreatment of platelets with L-arginine, the precursor of NO. Ox-LDL also caused a concentration-dependent reduction in the uptake of 3H-L-arginine by platelets. In addition, NO synthase activity, measured as conversion of 3H-L-arginine to 3H-L-citrulline, decreased on incubation of platelet cytosol with ox-LDL. Nitrite production was also reduced by treatment of platelets with ox-LDL. These effects of ox-LDL on NO synthase activity and nitrite production were reversed by pretreatment of platelets with L-arginine. Concurrent with the decrease in NO production, cytosolic cGMP was inhibited in ox-LDL-treated platelets. The inhibitory effects of ox-LDL were dependent in part on the increase of cholesterol in the platelets. Western blot analysis demonstrated approximately 50% reduction in the expression of NO synthase protein in platelets treated with ox-LDL. CONCLUSIONS: These observations indicate that the L-arginine-NO pathway is involved in the effects of ox-LDL on platelet function and that ox-LDL stimulates platelet function primarily by diminishing NO synthase expression as well as decreasing the uptake of L-arginine.

1844235|t|Multistage prostate carcinogenesis: the role of hormones.
1844235|a|Prostate cancer is the most frequently occurring non-skin cancer in men in the U.S.A. and other Western countries, but its etiology is poorly understood. Human prostate carcinogenesis has been viewed as a multi-step process involving progression from low histologic grade, small latent carcinoma, to large, higher grade, metastasizing carcinoma. However, recent data suggest that a variety of pathogenetic pathways exist. The precise role of hormones in the genesis of human prostate cancer remains largely undefined. It is difficult to investigate stages in the development of human prostate cancer, but some animal models provide opportunities in this regard. Short-term treatment of rats with chemical carcinogens will produce a low incidence (5-15%) of prostate cancer, provided that prostatic cell proliferation is enhanced during carcinogen exposure. A high carcinoma incidence can only be produced by chronic treatment with testosterone following administration of carcinogens such as N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU). Testosterone markedly enhances prostate carcinogenesis even at doses that do not measurably increase circulating testosterone. Thus, testosterone is a strong tumor promoter for the rat prostate. All such MNU-initiated, testosterone-promoted tumors are adenocarcinomas mostly originating from the dorsolateral and anterior, but not ventral, prostate lobes. A high frequency (70%) of activation of the K-ras gene by a G35 to A mutation occurs in these carcinomas. A variable frequency of activation of H-ras and K-ras genes occurs in human prostate carcinomas. Another rat model, representing a different pathogenetic pathway, involves chronic administration of estradiol-17 beta in combination with low-dose testosterone. The resulting carcinomas are low-grade and originate exclusively from periurethral ducts of the dorsolateral and anterior prostate. We recently found a major adduct by 32P postlabeling analysis in the tissue region that includes these ducts, but not in, e.g., the ventral prostate, of rats treated for 16-24 weeks. While it is unknown whether testosterone is a tumor promoter in this system, the presence of a DNA adduct suggests that estradiol-17 beta acts as a tumor-initiating agent in this system.

2561899|t|Bicarbonate inhibition of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Hansenula wingei growth in apple juice.
2561899|a|The ability of sodium bicarbonate to inhibit growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Hansenula wingei in apple juice was investigated. Sodium bicarbonate at concentrations of 0.06, 0.12, and 0.24 M was added to pasteurized apple juice that was then inoculated with 10(3) or 10(5) cfu/ml of either yeast. Growth of both yeasts was inhibited by 0.12 M sodium bicarbonate when incubation was at 4 degrees C; 0.24 M sodium bicarbonate caused a slow die off of yeast. At 18 degrees C, H. wingei became more sensitive and died in the presence of 0.12 M sodium bicarbonate, but S. cerevisiae became resistant to 0.24 M sodium bicarbonate. These results could not be attributed to bicarbonate-induced pH elevation or sodium. Potassium and ammonium bicarbonate were also inhibitory, implicating bicarbonate ion as the antimicrobial agent.

25311129|t|A redox-sensitive yellow fluorescent protein sensor for monitoring nuclear glutathione redox dynamics.
25311129|a|Intracellular redox homeostasis is crucial for many cellular functions, but accurate measurements of cellular compartment-specific redox states remain technically challenging. Genetically encoded biosensors, including the glutathione-specific redox-sensitive yellow fluorescent protein (rxYFP), provide an alternative approach to overcome the limitations of conventional glutathione/glutathione disulfide (GSH/GSSG) redox measurements. In this chapter we describe methods to measure the nuclear rxYFP redox state in human cells by a redox Western blot technique. A nucleus-targeted rxYFP sensor can be used to sense nuclear steady-state and dynamic redox changes in response to oxidative stress. Complementary to existing redox sensors and conventional redox measurements, nucleus-targeted rxYFP sensors provide a novel tool for examining nuclear redox homeostasis in mammalian cells, permitting high-resolution readout of steady glutathione state and dynamics of redox changes. The technique described may be used with minimal variations to study the effects of stress conditions which lead to glutathione redox changes.

8125125|t|C3a activates reactive oxygen radical species production and intracellular calcium transients in human eosinophils.
8125125|a|Whereas C5a is a well-established potent activator of eosinophils, the functional role of C3a in the activation of eosinophils is, so far, poorly understood. Here, the activation of human eosinophils stimulated with C3a was analyzed and compared to C5a activation. Flow-cytometrical measurements revealed that stimulation of eosinophils by C3a resulted in a transient elevation of the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the production of reactive oxygen radical species (ROS) of eosinophils after C3a and C5a stimulation was measured by lucigenin-dependent chemiluminescence and quantified by superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome C. Half maximal and maximal ROS production in response to C3a was observed at 50 ng/ml and 1000 ng/ml, respectively, whereas C3a-desArg was inactive. To ensure that C3a stimulation was not caused by contamination with C5a, monoclonal antibodies were used to demonstrate the specificity of C3a. The effect of C3a was completely abolished in the presence of monovalent antigen-binding fragments of a functionally blocking anti-C3a monoclonal antibody. In addition, blockade of the C5a receptor by the monoclonal anti-C5a receptor antibody S5/1 totally inhibited the C5a-evoked ROS production, whereas the C3a response in the presence of S5/1 was unaffected. Finally, desensitization experiments revealed a homologous desensitization of C3a after restimulation with C3a. In contrast, no cross-desensitization was observed upon stimulation with C5a. Furthermore, the C3a- and C5a-induced production of ROS of eosinophils was totally inhibited by pertussis toxin, indicating the involvement of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (Gi-proteins). In summary, these results demonstrate that C3a is a potent activator for eosinophils initiating transient [Ca2+]i changes and production of reactive oxygen species. C3a therefore may play a part in the pathophysiology of diseases with eosinophil and complement activation.

23964451|t|Kinetic inhibition of human salivary alpha-amylase by a novel cellobiose-containing tetrasaccharide.
23964451|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the inhibitory kinetics of a novel cellobiose-containing tetrasaccharide on human salivary alpha-amylase (HSA). MATERIAL AND METHOD: Synthesis of cellobiose-containing tetrasaccharide was catalyzed by Paenibacillus sp. All CGTase using beta-CD as a donor and cellobiose as an acceptor under the optimal conditions. The reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC and a cellobiose-containing tetrasaccharide obtained was studied for its inhibitory kinetics. RESULTS: In vitro activity of human salivary alpha-amylase showed the optimum pH and temperature at 7.0 and 37 degrees C, respectively. The effects of metal ions, protective chemicals and saccharides on alpha-amylase activity, they were found that 10 mM concentration of CaCl2 and NaCl enhanced the enzyme activity. In contrast, the enzyme activity was significantly inhibited by 10 mM of HgCI2, alpha-cyclodextrin (alpha-CD) and synthetic cellobiose-containing tetrasaccharide. Chemicals often used as protective substance for enzyme such as beta-mercaptoethanol, EDTA or used as fungicide during enzyme purification (NaN3) had no effect on the activity of this enzyme. As a cellobiose-containing tetrasaccharide was shown to have a pronounce inhibition on alpha-amylase activity. Its inhibition kinetic was performed and found that cellobiose-containing tetrasaccharide was a competitive inhibitor with a Ki value of 7.89 microM. CONCLUSION: Inhibition kinetic of a cellobiose-containing tetrasaccharide on alpha-amylase activity was competitive type with Ki value of 7.89 microM. In addition, these results will be a basic knowledge in controlling alpha-amylase actions that have influence on blood glucose level of trial animal and human further

25661351|t|The photodynamic effect of far-red range phthalocyanines (AlPc and Pc green) supported by electropermeabilization in human gastric adenocarcinoma cells of sensitive and resistant type.
25661351|a|INTRODUCTION: Electroporation (EP) is commonly applied for effective drug transport thorough cell membranes based on the application of electromagnetic field. When applied with cytostatics, it is called electrochemotherapy (ECT) - a quite new method of cancer treatment. A high-voltage pulse causes the formation of temporary pores in the cell membrane which create an additional way for the intracellular drug transport. In the current work, EP was effectively merged with the already known photodynamic therapy (PDT) to selective photosensitizers' delivery to diseased tissue. The application of electroporation can reduce the dose of applied drug. RESEARCH OBJECTIVE: The aim of research was to evaluate the effectiveness of photodynamic reaction using two near infrared cyanines (AlPc and Pc green) combined with electroporation in two human gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two human cell lines - EPG85-257P (parental) and EPG85-257RDB (resistant to daunorubicin) - of gastric cancer were used. The effect of two photosensitizers (aluminum 1,8,15,22-tetrakis(-phenylthio)-29H,31H-phthalocyanine chloride and Phthalocyanine green) was investigated. The efficiency of EP parameters was assessed by propidium iodide uptake. The viability assay was applied to analyse EP, PDT and EP-PDT effect. Cyanine localization was determined by confocal microscopy. Immunocytochemical evaluation of manganese superoxide dismutase and glutathione S-transferase-pi was determined after applied therapies. RESULTS: PDT in combination with EP affected the viability of EPG85-257P and EPG85-257RDB cells negatively while both cyanine were used. The most evident changes were observed in the following concentrations: 15, 10 and 5μM. The optimal field strength for enhanced EP-PDT was 800 and 1200V/cm. AlPc distributed selectively in the lysosomes of parental cell line. CONCLUSIONS: PDT, enhanced by EP, caused decreased viability when compared to the application of PDT alone. Both phthalocyanines found to be more effective after electroporation. Due to the low concentration of light-sensitive compounds and safety of electroporation itself, a treatment plan can be an alternative therapeutic modality against gastric adenocarcinomas.

9663100|t|Combined effects of laser irradiation/solution fluoride ion on enamel demineralization.
9663100|a|OBJECTIVE: The effects of CO2 laser irradiation of dental enamel were evaluated in enamel demineralization experiments in partially saturated solutions (i.e., solutions containing both calcium and phosphate ions) with and without fluoride ions. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Previous studies had shown that a continuous-wave CO2 laser at an energy density of around 130 J/cm2 may induce an increased acid resistance in human dental enamel as assessed by exposure to severe demineralization conditions (0.1 mol/L acetate buffer, pH 4.5 and ionic strength 0.5 mol/L). METHODS: Enamel blocks were irradiated with a continuous-wave CO2 laser at a wavelength of 10.6 microns using energy densities of from 42.5 to 170.0 J/cm2. The blocks were then exposed to a partially saturated demineralizing solution with or without 0.2 ppm fluoride at a temperature of 30 degrees C for 24 hours. The demineralization was examined both qualitatively by light microscopy and quantitatively by microradiography. RESULTS: A comparison between the lased and the unlased portions of enamel showed increased acid-resistance with increasing laser energy density and, at the highest energy density of 170.0 J/cm2, there was little or no lesion development in the fluoride-free dissolution medium. The demineralization of enamel was reduced dramatically in the presence of 0.2 ppm fluoride for both lased and unlased enamel; there was only modest lesion development observed for unlased enamel and, at an energy density as low as 85.0 J/cm2, the surface of enamel was found to be completely protected. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with the mechanism that laser irradiation of dental enamel results in significant reduction of the effective solubility of enamel mineral and that there is a significant synergism between laser irradiation and solution fluoride with regard to this effect.

8432528|t|Human carbonyl reductase (CBR) localized to band 21q22.1 by high-resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization displays gene dosage effects in trisomy 21 cells.
8432528|a|Human carbonyl reductase (CBR) belongs to a group of NADPH-dependent enzymes called aldo-keto reductases. The enzyme can function as an aldo-keto reductase or as a quinone reductase with potential for modulating quinone-mediated oxygen free radicals. The CBR gene was mapped by high-resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization to band 21q22.12, very close to the SOD1 locus at position 21q22.11. CBR displayed gene dosage effects in trisomy 21 human lymphoblasts at the DNA and mRNA levels. Lymphoblasts with increasing chromosome 21 ploidy also showed increased aldo-keto reductase activity and increased quinone reductase activity. Both aldo-keto reductase activity and quinone reductase activity have been shown to be associated with carbonyl reductase. The location of CBR near SOD1 and the increased enzyme activity and potential for free radical modulation in trisomy 21 cells implicate CBR as a candidate for contributing to the pathology of certain diseases such as Down syndrome and Alzheimer disease.

26645431|t|Glycation Contributes to Interaction Between Human Bone Alkaline Phosphatase and Collagen Type I.
26645431|a|Bone is a biological composite material comprised primarily of collagen type I and mineral crystals of calcium and phosphate in the form of hydroxyapatite (HA), which together provide its mechanical properties. Bone alkaline phosphatase (ALP), produced by osteoblasts, plays a pivotal role in the mineralization process. Affinity contacts between collagen, mainly type II, and the crown domain of various ALP isozymes were reported in a few in vitro studies in the 1980s and 1990s, but have not attracted much attention since, although such interactions may have important implications for the bone mineralization process. The objective of this study was to investigate the binding properties of human collagen type I to human bone ALP, including the two bone ALP isoforms B1 and B2. ALP from human liver, human placenta and E. coli were also studied. A surface plasmon resonance-based analysis, supported by electrophoresis and blotting, showed that bone ALP binds stronger to collagen type I in comparison with ALPs expressed in non-mineralizing tissues. Further, the B2 isoform binds significantly stronger to collagen type I in comparison with the B1 isoform. Human bone and liver ALP (with identical amino acid composition) displayed pronounced differences in binding, revealing that post-translational glycosylation properties govern these interactions to a large extent. In conclusion, this study presents the first evidence that glycosylation differences in human ALPs are of crucial importance for protein-protein interactions with collagen type I, although the presence of the ALP crown domain may also be necessary. Different binding affinities among the bone ALP isoforms may influence the mineral-collagen interface, mineralization kinetics, and degree of bone matrix mineralization, which are important factors determining the material properties of bone.

181968|t|Dissociation of phagocytosis, metabolic stimulation and lysosomal enzyme release in human leukocytes.
181968|a|In this paper studies are reported concerning the relationship between particle binding to the plasma membrane of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN's), phagocytosis, generation of oxidative metabolites, and the release of lysosomal enzymes by these cells. Superoxide (O2-) generation by, and lysosomal enzyme release from, normal PMN's and cytochalasin B-treated cells were measured. We have found that neither phagocytosis nor lysosomal degranulation are prerequisites for enhanced O2- generation. Cytochalasin B-treated PMN's, incapable of ingesting particles but still able to bind particles to membrane receptors, generated enhanced amounts of O2- when treated with serum-treated zymosan (STZ), a C3b receptor stimulus, or with aggregated IgG (agg IgG), an Fc receptor stimulus. Moreover, the soluble stimulators complement component C5a, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), and calcium ions in the presence of the ionophore A23187, also increased the O2- production of these cells. In all cases a time and dose-dependent stimulation was found of both the O2- generation and the lysosomal enzyme release, but there was no correlation between ability of any stimulus to provoke enzyme release and its ability to stimulate O2- generation. When PMN's were preincubated with 5 X 10(-4) M hydrocortisone-Na-succinate, lysosomal enzyme exocytosis with the immune reactants was inhibited 16-35%. Hydrocortisone also inhibited O2- generation, except when STZ was used as the stimulus. Thus, in the case of stimulation of functional processes of PMN's via the C3b receptor, hydrocortisone inhibits membrane fusion without interfering with one of the early biochemical events (O2-production).

10851574|t|Aromatase in aging women.
10851574|a|Cessation of ovarian estrogen secretion is the key event during the climacteric. An enzyme termed aromatase in a number of human tissues and cells, including ovarian granulosa cells, the placental syncytiotrophoblast, adipose and skin fibroblasts, bone, and the brain, catalyzes the conversion of C19 steroids to estrogens. Aromatase expression in adipose tissue and possibly the skin primarily accounts for the extraglandular (peripheral) formation of estrogen and increases as a function of body weight and advancing age. Sufficient circulating levels of the biologically active estrogen, estradiol, can be produced as a result of extraglandular aromatization of androstenedione to estrone, which is subsequently reduced to estradiol in peripheral tissues, to cause uterine bleeding and endometrial hyperplasia and cancer in obese anovulatory or postmenopausal women. Extraglandular aromatase expression in adipose tissue and skin (via increasing circulating levels of estradiol) and bone (via increasing local estrogen concentrations) is of paramount importance in slowing the rate of postmenopausal bone loss. Moreover, excessive or inappropriate aromatase expression was demonstrated in adipose fibroblasts surrounding a breast carcinoma, endometriosis-derived stromal cells, and stromal cells in endometrial cancer and gave rise to increased local estrogen concentrations in these tissues. Whether systemically delivered or locally produced, elevated estrogen levels promote the growth of these steroid-responsive tissues. Finally, local estrogen biosynthesis by aromatase activity in the brain may be important in the regulation of various cognitive and hypothalamic functions. The regulation of aromatase expression in human cells via alternatively used promoters, which can be activated or inhibited by various hormones, increases the complexity of estrogen biosynthesis in the human body. Aromatase expression is under the control of the classically located proximal promoter II in the ovary and a far distal promoter I.1 (40 kb upstream of the translation initiation site) in the placenta. In adipose tissue, two other promoters (I.4 and I.3) located between I.1 and II are used in addition to the ovarian-type promoter II. To add a further twist, promoter use in adipose fibroblasts switches between promoters II/I.3 and I.4 upon treatment of these cells with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) versus glucocorticoids plus cytokines. Moreover, the presence of a carcinoma in breast adipose tissue causes a switch of promoter use from I.4 to II/I.3. Molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for estrogen formation and their physiologic and clinical relevance will be reviewed in this article.

15820217|t|Evaluation of spin trapping agents and trapping conditions for detection of cell-generated reactive oxygen species.
15820217|a|Electron paramagnetic resonance with spin trapping is a useful technique to detect reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide radical anion (O2*-), a key species in many biological processes. We evaluated the abilities of four spin traps in trapping cell-generated O2*-: 5-tert-butoxycarbonyl-5-methyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (BMPO), 2-diethoxyphosphoryl-2-phenethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrole N-oxide (DEPPEPO), 5-diethoxyphosphoryl-5-methyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DEPMPO), and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO). Optimal experimental conditions for obtaining maximal signal intensity of O2*- adduct in a cellular system were first studied. The maximal intensities of BMPO, DEPMPO, and DMPO adducts were similar while DEPPEPO did not trap cell-generated O2*- induced by 1,6-benzo[a]pyrene quinone in a human mammary epithelial cell line (MCF-10A). BMPO and DEPMPO adducts were more stable, considering the stability of their maximal signal, than DMPO adduct in the tested cellular systems. In addition, we observed that O2*- spin adducts were reduced to their corresponding hydroxyl adducts in the cellular system. The selection of optimal spin trap in trapping cell-generated O2*- is discussed.

7062252|t|Glucosylated albumin and its influence on salicylate binding.
7062252|a|Human serum albumin was incubated at 37 degrees in 0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) under sterile conditions for up to 10 days with labeled [14C]glucose (1-25 mg/ml). Glucose incorporated into albumin was calculated following extensive dialysis of the incubation mixture. The results indicated that glucose reacted with albumin by a nonenzymatic process involving Schiff base formation and Amadori rearrangement to a stable ketoamine derivative. The degree of glucosylation was dependent on the reaction time, glucose concentration, and pH. Glucosylation was enhanced when albumin was fatty acid free. Glucosylated albumin was separated from unmodified albumin by cation exchange chromatography on carboxymethylcellulose and quantitated colorimetrically with 2-thiobarbituric acid. Salicylate binding studies revealed that the glucosylated component had a decreased salicylate binding capacity accompanied by a reduction in the number of classes of binding sites.

19490754|t|Oxidative stress and total antioxidant capacity in human plasma.
19490754|a|While several tools are already available for the separate measurement of the oxidant and antioxidant pools, a single, quick and easy method for determining total oxidative stress would be advantageous. In the present study, we compare the plasma of untreated patients with leukemia/solid gynecological tumors (n = 50) and current regular smokers (n = 50) with a smoking history of >or=10 cigarettes per day to the plasma of healthy blood donors. Standard tools were used to measure total oxidant status, ceruloplasmin activity, total antioxidant capacity, uric acid content and oxidative stress index. Oxidative stress was also evaluated using the controversial d-ROMs test, a commercial method of reactive oxygen species detection. Statistically significant differences between the smokers and the control group were detected for all of the biochemical parameters. Conversely, the differences in the cancer patients were not statistically significant for oxidative stress.

25564529|t|Recognition of duplex RNA by the deaminase domain of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR2.
25564529|a|Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) hydrolytically deaminate adenosines (A) in a wide variety of duplex RNAs and misregulation of editing is correlated with human disease. However, our understanding of reaction selectivity is limited. ADARs are modular enzymes with multiple double-stranded RNA binding domains (dsRBDs) and a catalytic domain. While dsRBD binding is understood, little is known about ADAR catalytic domain/RNA interactions. Here we use a recently discovered RNA substrate that is rapidly deaminated by the isolated human ADAR2 deaminase domain (hADAR2-D) to probe these interactions. We introduced the nucleoside analog 8-azanebularine (8-azaN) into this RNA (and derived constructs) to mechanistically trap the protein-RNA complex without catalytic turnover for EMSA and ribonuclease footprinting analyses. EMSA showed that hADAR2-D requires duplex RNA and is sensitive to 2'-deoxy substitution at nucleotides opposite the editing site, the local sequence and 8-azaN nucleotide positioning on the duplex. Ribonuclease V1 footprinting shows that hADAR2-D protects ∼ 23 nt on the edited strand around the editing site in an asymmetric fashion (∼ 18 nt on the 5' side and ∼ 5 nt on the 3' side). These studies provide a deeper understanding of the ADAR catalytic domain-RNA interaction and new tools for biophysical analysis of ADAR-RNA complexes.

11162432|t|Targeting of active human cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1) to the periplasmic space of Escherichia coli.
11162432|a|Native human cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1) was appended at its amino terminus to the secretory signal of Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase. The chimeric P450 construct was placed under the transcriptional control of the native phoA promoter in a prokaryotic expression vector. Induction of the hemoprotein by heterologous expression in E. coli following growth in a phosphate-limited medium resulted in abundant synthesis of recombinant CYP1A1 as detected by reduced CO-difference spectra. Furthermore, the signal-appended CYP1A1 was translocated across the bacterial inner membrane by the sec-dependent pathway and processed to yield authentic, heme-incorporated P450 within the periplasmic space. In vitro and whole-cell metabolic activity studies showed that the periplasmically-located CYP1A1 competently catalysed NADPH-dependent benzo[a]pyrene 3-hydroxylation and 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation. The means to localise cytochromes P450 in the periplasm offers an ability to produce high levels of protein, attributable to the less hostile nature of the compartment, and therein the enzymes for posttranslational assembly of heme with the translocated protein.

12938085|t|Trimethylaminuria and a human FMO3 mutation database.
12938085|a|Trimethylaminuria (TMAuria), or fish-odor syndrome, is due to defective flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3). In the liver, this protein catalyzes the NADPH-dependent oxidative metabolism of odorous trimethylamine (TMA), derived in the gut from dietary sources, to nonodorous trimethylamine N-oxide (TMA N-oxide). Affected individuals are unable to carry out this reaction and consequently exude a fishy body odor, due to the secretion of TMA in their breath and sweat and its excretion in their urine. This leads to a variety of psychosocial problems, including disruption of schooling, clinical depression, and attempted suicide. Twelve missense, three nonsense, and one gross deletion mutation are known to cause TMAuria. FMO3 is also a drug-metabolizing enzyme and compromised activity is expected to have implications for the efficacy of drug treatment and the possibility of adverse drug reactions both in TMAuric patients and in the general population. To date eight polymorphic variants, not associated with TMAuria, have been reported. A human FMO3 mutation database was created using MuStar, a locus-specific database system for maintaining data about allelic variants and distributing these via the World Wide Web. The database currently contains 24 entries and is accessible on the World Wide Web via the URL http://human-fmo3.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/Human_FMO3. Additional entries can be submitted via the curator of the database or via a web-based form.

10329428|t|Cloning and functional characterization of a sodium-dependent phosphate transporter expressed in human lung and small intestine.
10329428|a|A cDNA clone with 53% amino acid identity to the human type II sodium-dependent phosphate transporter (NaPi-3) was isolated from human small intestine and lung. Functional characterization in Xenopus laevis oocytes showed this cDNA to encode a sodium-dependent phosphate transporter. The electrogenic response is similar to that found in other type II transporters but an inverse pH dependence was observed. By Northern blot, a 4.2-kb transcript was found to be abundantly expressed in lung and, to a lesser degree, in several other tissues of epithelial origin including small intestine, pancreas, prostate, and kidney. This transcript encompasses a 2.073-kb open reading frame which is most closely related (78% amino acid identity) to the mouse sodium-dependent phosphate transporter IIb isoform. This novel transporter, designated human NaPi-3b (Genbank AF111856), appears to be an isoform of the mammalian renal type II co-transporter family.

11211100|t|Cytoskeletal interactions determine the electrophysiological properties of human EAG potassium channels.
11211100|a|The electrophysiological properties of ether a go-go (EAG) potassium channels are modified during the cell cycle when they are expressed in heterologous systems. In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mammalian somatic cells we found that the cell-cycle-dependent modulation of human EAG (hEAG) channels occurs during the M phase. This modulation has three components: reduction in current density, increased sensitivity to block by intracellular sodium, and increased selectivity for potassium ions. In this work, these three properties have been used to define the mitotic phenotype of EAG currents. The signaling pathway leading to such changes of channel properties is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that cytoskeletal interactions might affect the electrophysiological changes observed during the cell cycle. The disruption of actin filaments induces a significant increase in current density, without inducing the cell-cycle-related phenotype. In contrast, disturbance of the microtubules, achieved by pharmacological means or by mechanical excision of the membrane patch, does induce the cell-cycle-related phenotype. Our results demonstrate that hEAG channels establish complex interactions with cytoskeletal elements, and that these interactions strongly influence the properties of the channels. We also conclude that the electrophysiological changes observed during the cell cycle are most likely due to reorganization of the cytoskeleton during the G2/M transition.

2283678|t|Thiamin transport by human erythrocytes and ghosts.
2283678|a|Thiamin transport in human erythrocytes and resealed pink ghosts was evaluated by incubating both preparations at 37 or 20 degrees C in the presence of [3H]-thiamin of high specific activity. The rate of uptake was consistently higher in erythrocytes than in ghosts. In both preparations, the time course of uptake was independent from the presence of Na+ and did not reach equilibrium after 60 min incubation. At concentrations below 0.5 microM and at 37 degrees C, thiamin was taken up predominantly by a saturable mechanism in both erythrocytes and ghosts. Apparent kinetic constants were: for erythrocytes, Km = 0.12, 0.11 and 0.10 microM and Jmax = 0.01, 0.02 and 0.03 pmol.microliter-1 intracellular water after 3, 15, and 30 min incubation times, respectively; for ghosts, Km = 0.16 and 0.51 microM and Jmax = 0.01 and 0.04 pmol.microliter-1 intracellular water after 15 and 30 min incubation times, respectively. At 20 degrees C, the saturable component disappeared in both preparations. Erythrocyte thiamin transport was not influenced by the presence of D-glucose or metabolic inhibitors. In both preparations, thiamin transport was inhibited competitively by unlabeled thiamin, pyrithiamin, amprolium and, to a lesser extent, oxythiamin, the inhibiting effect being always more marked in erythrocytes than in ghosts. Only approximately 20% of the thiamin taken up by erythrocytes was protein- (probably membrane-) bound. A similar proportion was esterified to thiamin pyrophosphate. Separate experiments using valinomycin and SCN- showed that the transport of thiamin, which is a cation at pH 7.4, is unaffected by changes in membrane potential in both preparations.

8111458|t|Enzymes induced by ethanol differently affect the pharmacokinetics of trichloroethylene and 1,1,1-trichloroethane.
8111458|a|This study was undertaken to clarify the effect of enzymes induced by ethanol consumption on the pharmacokinetics of trichloroethylene (TRI, a highly metabolised substance) and 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TRI, a poorly metabolised substance). Rats maintained on a control liquid diet or a liquid diet containing ethanol (2 g/day/rat) for not less than three weeks were exposed to either TRI (50, 100, 500, and 1000 ppm) or 1,1,1-TRI (50, 100, and 500 ppm) by inhalation for six hours and the concentration of each compound in the blood and the urinary excretion of metabolites (trichloroethanol and trichloroacetic acid) were measured over several hours. Ethanol, which increased the in vitro metabolism of both compounds about fivefold, enhanced the in vivo metabolism of TRI only at high levels of exposure (marginally at 500 and considerably at 1000 ppm), whereas the metabolism of 1,1,1-TRI was enhanced at all concentrations tested. Moreover, there was a definite difference in the effect of induction of enzymes between the two solvents: the enhanced metabolism of TRI in vivo was shown by a decrease in the blood concentration of TRI as well as by an increase in the urinary excretion of its metabolites, whereas that of 1,1,1-TRI was shown by an increase in the urinary excretion of its metabolites alone. These results suggest that the induction of enzymes differentially affects the pharmacokinetics of TRI and 1,1,1-TRI in human occupational exposure: TRI metabolism may be increased only at concentrations much higher than the current occupational exposure limit (mostly 50 ppm), whereas 1,1,1-TRI metabolism may be increased at an exposure similar to occupational exposure.

3621615|t|Hydrolysis of phosphatidate by human placental alkaline phosphatase.
3621615|a|Highly purified alkaline phosphatase of human placenta catalyzed the hydrolysis of phosphatidate with quantitative formation of almost stoichiometric amounts of diglyceride and inorganic phosphate. In the presence of sodium deoxycholate, the activity was maximal at pH 8.8. The activity was strongly inhibited by L-phenylalanine but scarcely affected by NaF. These results show that alkaline phosphatase hydrolyzes phosphatidate under different conditions from those for activity of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase.

19625629|t|Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the urotensin-II receptor antagonist palosuran in healthy male subjects.
19625629|a|Palosuran is a new potent and specific antagonist of the human urotensin II (U-II) receptor (UT receptor). This entry-into-humans study evaluated the tolerability and safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of palosuran in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending-dose design. Oral doses of 5 to 2000 mg were given to 9 sequential groups of 8 healthy young men (6 on active drug, 2 on placebo) each. At regular intervals, tolerability and safety parameters and plasma levels of palosuran and U-II were determined. Urine was collected to determine excretion of sodium, potassium, creatinine, and palosuran. In this study, palosuran was well tolerated. No serious adverse events or dose-related adverse events were reported. No treatment-related pattern was detected for vital signs, clinical laboratory parameters, or electrocardiography parameters. After rapid absorption, palosuran displayed a plasma concentration-time profile characterized by 2 peaks at approximately 1 and 4 hours after drug administration. The apparent terminal elimination half-life was approximately 20 hours. AUC and C(max) values increased proportionally with doses up to 500 mg. Excretion of unchanged palosuran in urine was limited. No consistent effect was found on any of the pharmacodynamic variables measured. The results of this entry-into-humans study warrant further investigation of the therapeutic potential of palosuran.

7599287|t|Flow cytometric assay of phagocytic activity of human neutrophils and monocytes in whole blood by neutral red uptake.
7599287|a|In a new, simple, and fast flow-cytometric method for the simultaneous measurement of phagocytic activity of human neutrophils and monocytes in whole blood, the fluorescence capability of the well-known vital stain, neutral red was used. The incubation of 0.5 ml heparinized human blood with the phagocytic stimulus of zymosan dose- and time-dependently increased the percentage and the red fluorescence intensity of both neutrophils (4.3 +/- 1.2 times) and monocytes (2.7 +/- 0.7 times) measured cytofluorimetrically. Decreased uptake of neutral red was observed in a patient with phagocytic disorder, based upon impaired engulfment of particles and production of reactive oxygen species. In a patient with chronic granulomatosis, however, no decrease of neutral red uptake was measured. Platelet activating factor and phorbol myristate acetate were also able to increase the uptake of neutral red by both monocytes and neutrophils, but to a lesser extent than zymosan. The advantage of this method is the possibility for the simultaneous measurement of phagocytic activities of monocytes and neutrophils stimulated by either particles or soluble activators. This method is suitable for the selective measurement of activation processes not related to the production of free radicals in the phagocytes.

25588222|t|Effects of long-term exposure to hydrogen sulfide on human red blood cells.
25588222|a|BACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) exhibits both physiological and toxicological roles in the biological systems. Acute exposure to high levels of H2S is life threatening while long-term exposure to ambient levels of H2S elicits human health effects. OBJECTIVE: To study the harmful effects of long-term exposure to low levels of H2S on human blood cells. METHODS: 110 adult workers from Iran who were occupationally exposed to 0-90 ppb H2S for 1-30 years were studied. The participants aged between 18 and 60 years and were exposed directly or indirectly to sulfur compounds (exposed group). The origin of H2S was natural gas processing plants. A control group consisting of 110 males who were not in contact with H2S was also studied. For all participants, hematological profile including total hemoglobin and red blood cell count and sulfhemoglobin, methemoglobin levels were measured. RESULTS: Among all parameters evaluated in this study the mean methemoglobin and sulfhemoglobin levels were significantly higher among workers who were exposed to sulfur compounds than the control group. Major differences throughout the study period for sulfhemoglobinemia among exposed groups were observed. CONCLUSION: Long-term exposure to even low levels of H2S in workplaces may have potential harmful effects on human health.

12713795|t|CR2 units of CR2 complexes are possibly associated with nucleophilic agents through reactive covalent links.
12713795|a|The human complement receptor type 2 (CR2/CD21), a transmembrane glycoprotein, associates with a variety of surface antigens and proteins in the cell membrane. We examined the possibilities that the CR2 units of CR2 complexes are associated through internal covalent links reactive with nucleophilic agents, e.g. H(2)O or methylamine, and that CR2-positive cells process anti-CR2 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). Data from immunoblotting and cytofluorimetry with CR2-binding site-specific MoAbs show that: (i) CR2-positive Raji cells release soluble CR2 isoforms into the medium when incubated in phosphate buffered saline; (ii) despite affecting the detection of one soluble CR2 isoform, methylamine treatment of soluble CR2 allows the detection of another of its isoforms; (iii) limited pre-treatment of cells with methylamine reveals a more heterogeneous CR2-positive cell population or enhances the detection of CR2; (iv) cell treatment with CR2-binding site-specific MoAbs enhances the detection of CR2 isoform(s). The data suggest that CR2 is shed mainly as a soluble CR2 complex, in which the CR2 units link covalently and react with nucleophilic agents. Raji cells may process bound fragments (145 kDa) that are recognised by and become bound by anti-CR2 MoAb.

26013830|t|Human CLC-K Channels Require Palmitoylation of Their Accessory Subunit Barttin to Be Functional.
26013830|a|CLC-K/barttin chloride channels are essential for NaCl re-absorption in Henle's loop and for potassium secretion by the stria vascularis in the inner ear. Here, we studied the posttranslational modification of such channels by palmitoylation of their accessory subunit barttin. We found that barttin is palmitoylated in vivo and in vitro and identified two conserved cysteine residues at positions 54 and 56 as palmitoylation sites. Point mutations at these two residues reduce the macroscopic current amplitudes in cells expressing CLC-K/barttin channels proportionally to the relative reduction in palmitoylated barttin. CLC-K/barttin expression, plasma membrane insertion, and single channel properties remain unaffected, indicating that these mutations decrease the number of active channels. R8W and G47R, two naturally occurring barttin mutations identified in patients with Bartter syndrome type IV, reduce barttin palmitoylation and CLC-K/barttin channel activity. Palmitoylation of the accessory subunit barttin might thus play a role in chloride channel dysfunction in certain variants of Bartter syndrome. We did not observe pronounced alteration of barttin palmitoylation upon increased salt and water intake or water deprivation, indicating that this posttranslational modification does not contribute to long term adaptation to variable water intake. Our results identify barttin palmitoylation as a novel posttranslational modification of CLC-K/barttin chloride channels.

23964564|t|Naturally occurring sulfonium-ion glucosidase inhibitors and their derivatives: a promising class of potential antidiabetic agents.
23964564|a|In humans, four different enzymes mediate the digestion of ingested carbohydrates. First salivary and pancreatic α-amylases, the two endoacting retaining glucosidases, break down the complex starch molecules into smaller linear maltose-oligomers (LM) and branched α-limit dextrins (αLDx). Then two retaining exoglucosidases, maltase-glucoamylase (MGAM) and sucrase-isomaltase (SI), convert those molecules into glucose in the small intestine. The small intestinal brush-border epithelial cells anchor MGAM and SI, and each contains a catalytic N- and C-terminal subunit, ntMGAM, ctMGAM, ntSI, and ctSI, respectively. All four catalytic domains have, to varying extents, α-1,4-exohydrolytic glucosidase activity and belong to the glycoside hydrolase family 31 (GH31). ntSI and ctSI show additional activity toward α-1,6 (isomaltose substrates) and α-1,2 (sucrose) glycosidic linkages, respectively. Because they mediate the final steps of starch digestion, both MGAM and SI are important target enzymes for the treatment of type-2 diabetes. Because of their potent inhibitory activities against the mammalian intestinal α-glucosidases, sulfonium-ion glucosidase inhibitors isolated from the antidiabetic herbal extracts of various Salacia species have received considerable attention recently. Thus far, researchers have isolated eight sulfonium-ion glucosidase inhibitors from Salacia species: salaprinol, salacinol, ponkoranol, kotalanol, and four of their corresponding de-O-sulfonated compounds, the structures of which comprise a 1,4-anhydro-4-thio-d-arabinitol and a polyhydroxylated acyclic side chain. Some of these compounds more strongly inhibit human intestinal α-glucosidases than the currently available antidiabetic drugs, acarbose and miglitol, and could serve as lead candidates in the treatment of type-2 diabetes. In this Account, we summarize progress in the field since 2010 with this class of inhibitors, with particular focus on their selective inhibitory activities against the intestinal glucosidases. Through structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies, we have modified the natural compounds to derive more potent, nanomolar inhibitors of human MGAM and SI. This structural optimization also yielded the most potent inhibitors known to date for each subunit. Furthermore, we observed that some of our synthetic inhibitors selectively blocked the activity of some mucosal α-glucosidases. Those results led to our current working hypothesis that selective inhibitors can dampen the action of a fast digesting subunit or subunits which places the burden of digestion on slower digesting subunits. That strategy can control the rate of starch digestion and glucose release to the body. Decreasing the initial glucose spike after a carbohydrate-rich meal and extending postprandial blood glucose delivery to the body can be desirable for diabetics and patients with other metabolic syndrome-associated diseases.

24777398|t|Lymphocyte-derived microparticles induce apoptosis of airway epithelial cells through activation of p38 MAPK and production of arachidonic acid.
24777398|a|The airway epithelium is critical for the normal integrity and function of the respiratory system. Excessive epithelial cell apoptosis contributes to cell damage and airway inflammation. We previously demonstrated that lymphocyte-derived microparticles (LMPs) induce apoptosis of human bronchial epithelial cells. However, the underlying mechanisms contributing to LMPs-evoked epithelial cell death are largely unknown. Here we used bronchial and lung tissue cultures to confirm the pro-apoptotic effects of LMPs. In cell culture experiments, we found that LMPs induced human airway epithelial cell apoptosis with associated increases in caspase-3 activity. In addition, LMPs treatment triggered oxidative stress in epithelial cells by enhancing production of malondialdehyde, superoxide, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and by inhibiting production of the antioxidant glutathione. Moreover, decreasing cellular ROS with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine rescued epithelial cell viability. Together, these results demonstrate an important role for oxidative stress in LMPs-induced cell death. In epithelial cells, LMPs treatment induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and arachidonic acid accumulation. Moreover, arachidonic acid was significantly cytotoxic towards LMPs-treated epithelial cells, whereas inhibition of p38 MAPK was protective against these cytotoxic effects. Similarly, inhibition of arachidonic acid production led to decreased caspase-3 activity, thus rescuing airway epithelial cells from LMPs-induced cell death. In conclusion, our results show that LMPs induce airway epithelial cell apoptosis by activating p38 MAPK signaling and stimulating production of arachidonic acid, with consequent increases in oxidative stress and caspase-3 activity. As such, LMPs may be regarded as deleterious markers of epithelial cell damage in respiratory diseases.

25008790|t|Beta-nodavirus B2 protein induces hydrogen peroxide production, leading to Drp1-recruited mitochondrial fragmentation and cell death via mitochondrial targeting.
25008790|a|Because the role of the viral B2 protein in the pathogenesis of nervous necrosis virus infection remains unknown, the aim of the present study was to determine the effects of B2 protein on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-mediated cell death via mitochondrial targeting. Using a B2 deletion mutant, the B2 mitochondrial targeting signal sequence ((41)RTFVISAHAA(50)) correlated with mitochondrial free radical production and cell death in fish cells, embryonic zebrafish, and human cancer cells. After treatment of grouper fin cells (GF-1) overexpressing B2 protein with the anti-oxidant drug, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and overexpression of the antioxidant enzymes, zfCu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) and zfCatalase, decreased H2O2 production and cell death were observed. To investigate the correlation between B2 cytotoxicity and H2O2 production in vivo, B2 was injected into zebrafish embryos. Cell damage, as assessed by the acridine orange assay, gradually increased over 24 h post-fertilization, and was accompanied by marked increases in H2O2 production and embryonic death. Increased oxidative stress, as evidenced by the up-regulation of Mn SOD, catalase, and Nrf2, was also observed during this period. Finally, B2-induced dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation and cell death could be reversed by NAC and inhibitors of Drp1 and Mdivi in GF-1 cells. Taken together, betanodavirus B2 induces H2O2 production via targeting the mitochondria, where it inhibits complex II function. H2O2 activates Drp1, resulting in its association with the mitochondria, mitochondrial fission and cell death in vitro and in vivo.

11287411|t|Ikappa b-alpha, the NF-kappa B inhibitory subunit, interacts with ANT, the mitochondrial ATP/ADP translocator.
11287411|a|The transcription factor NF-kappaB regulates a wide set of genes involved in the establishment of many cellular processes that control cell activation, proliferation, and apoptosis. IkappaB inhibitory subunits integrate NF-kappaB activation signals through phosphorylation and ubiquitination of its N-terminal domain. Using the two-hybrid system in yeast, we searched for IkappaB-alpha N-terminal domain interactors and therefore potential NF-kappaB regulators. An interaction of IkappaB-alpha with the mitochondrial ATP/ADP translocator ANT was detected in yeast and confirmed in glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays and co-precipitation experiments in transfected cells. Subcellular cell fractionation, resistance to proteinase K treatment, and electron microscopy experiments demonstrated the presence of IkappaB-alpha and associated p65 NF-kappaB in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. IkappaB-alpha.NF-kappaB appeared to be released from mitochondria upon the induction of apoptosis by engagement of the Fas receptor. These data suggest that the mitochondrial IkappaB-alpha.NF-kappaB pool participates in the regulation of apoptosis.

2134860|t|[Effects of oxygen on growth of Streptococcus mutans].
2134860|a|Effects of oxygen on growth of Streptococcus mutans Ingbritt (serotype c) were examined. The strain could be passaged under aerobic conditions at 37 degrees C in a peptone/yeast extract medium containing 0.2% glucose. Although the growth rate was slightly retarded under aerobic conditions (the doubling time, 60 min; 45 min under anaerobic conditions), the increment of cellular dry weight change was 35 g per mole of glucose under both conditions. To investigate such aerotolerance in growth as indicated by these results, oxygen metabolism was compared between aerobically and anaerobically grown cells. No difference was observed in the apparent rate of superoxide production or superoxide dismutation. However, aerobically grown cells showed a higher activity of hydrogen peroxide reduction with glucose as substrate and accumulated a lower level of hydrogen peroxide when incubated with glucose under aerobic conditions. In addition, hydrogen peroxide added to the medium was less inhibitory to anaerobic growth when aerobic cells were used as the inoculum. These results indicate that aerotolerance of S. mutans Ingbritt can be ascribed at least in part to its hydrogen peroxide reducing activity which is elevated under aerobic conditions.

11542543|t|Basic design concept of Closed Ecology Experiment Facilities.
11542543|a|In order to study the relationship between the physiological metabolism of living things and the environmental factors such as the atmospheric contents and so on within the closed ecosystem, Closed Ecology Experiment Facilities (CEEF) were designed and now under construction based on the following concepts: (1) Individual sealed chambers (called modules) for the plant cultivation, animal breeding, human habitation and microbial waste treatment are to be constructed independently to be able to study the metabolic effects of each living thing on the environmental factors within closed ecosystem. (2) A chamber for the microbial waste treatment are to be replaced with two systems; wet oxidation reactors and chemical nitrogen fixation reactors. (3) Atmospheric control systems are to be independently attached to each module for stabilizing atmospheric contents in each module. (4) Any construction materials having the possibility to absorb oxygen and carbon dioxide are to be prohibited to use in each module for sustaining material balance. (5) Facilities have to be developed so that the closed plant and animal experiments can be done independently, as well as integrated experiments with plants and animals through exchanging foods, carbon dioxide, oxygen, condensed water and nutrient solution.

4591034|t|Attenuated vasodilator responses to K+ in essential hypertensive men.
4591034|a|To study limb vascular responses to K(+) in man, paired intrabrachial arterial infusions of isosmolar NaCl (control) and isosmolar KCl (0.077, 0.154, and 0.307 meq K(+)/min) in isosmolar NaCl were made in 20 normotensive men and 20 men with essential hypertension of mild to moderate severity. Limb blood pressures were monitored, limb blood flow was measured by indicator-dilution, and limb vascular resistance was calculated as mm Hg/ml flow/min/100 cm(3) limb volume. Measured concentrations of K(+) in limb venous plasma during infusion of 0.307 meq K(+)/min ranged from 4.8 to 9.0 meq/liter. Changes in limb venous hematocrit, sodium, calcium, magnesium, and osmolality were similar during control and KCl infusions. The infusions did not significantly change systemic blood K(+) concentration or blood pressures. Compared to NaCl, KCl decreased limb resistance (P < 0.05) in both normotensives and hypertensives, in a dose-related manner. Resting limb vascular resistances (IR) in hypertensives were greater (P < 0.05) than those in normotensives. Despite a positive correlation (P < 0.05) between IR and magnitude of response to K(+), responses in hypertensives to K(+) were not greater than those in normotensives. Further, analysis of covariance indicated that responses to 0.307 meq K(+)/min in hypertensives as a group were, in fact, less (P = 0.02) than those in normotensives. These results indicate that the vasodilator response to K(+) may be attenuated in a significant proportion of essential hypertensive men, as it is in renal hypertensive animals. These abnormal responses to K(+) in hypertensives may indicate an underlying defect in vascular K(+) metabolism.

18958662|t|Screening New Drugs for Immunotoxic Potential: II. Assessment of the Effects of Selective and Nonselective COX-2 Inhibitors on Complement Activation, Superoxide Anion Production and Leukocyte Chemotaxis and Migration Through Endothelial Cells.
18958662|a|Results from earlier experiments in our laboratories revealed that both selective and nonselective inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 possess little potential for decreasing in vitro phagocytosis by rat macrophages or canine neutrophils and no potential for decreasing in vivo phagocytosis by the intact murine immune system. We now report the results of studies to assess in vitro and ex vivo effects of the drugs on 1) canine complement activation, 2) generation of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide (oxidative burst) by canine neutrophils, and 3) leukocytic chemotaxis and transmigration through endothelial cell monolayers. In vitro concentrations of naproxen sodium, SC-236, SC-245, and SC-791 ranging from 0.1 to 10 muM were tested for their abilities to inhibit canine complement-mediated hemolysis of opsonized sheep erythrocytes and to block phorbol myristate acetate-induced oxidative burst in canine neutrophils. Both models responded to known inhibitory agents, leupeptin in the complement activation test and staurosporine in the superoxide anion assay. In contrast, tested nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs produced only trivial changes in complement activation and superoxide anion production. Experiments on plasma and neutrophils isolated from dogs administered an experimental selective COX-2 inhibitor during a 28-day toxicology study revealed no evidence of drug-associated changes in complement activation or formation of superoxide anion. SC-791 reduced chemotaxis of canine leukocytes toward zymosan-activated dog plasma, but not toward leukotriene B(4). None of the other drugs tested significantly affected leukocytic chemotaxis. Ibuprofen, SC-245 and SC-791 but not SC-236, reduced transmigration of canine leukocytes through endothelial cell monolayers. Based on the results of these experiments and our earlier studies we have concluded that, although high (suprapharmacologic) concentrations of the drugs may induce in vitro evidence of apparent immunomodulation of the innate immune system, the findings are unlikely to represent a significant human health risk.

21432071|t|Effects of methanolic extracts from broad beans on cellular growth and antioxidant enzyme activity.
21432071|a|OBJECTIVE: There are several reports of cellular-aging-dependent alterations in the antioxidant capacity of human fibroblasts. Fibroblasts show slower the growth rate at late passages (referred to hereafter as old cells) than at early passages (referred to hereafter as young cells). Antioxidants may control cellular growth by modulating reactive oxygen species (ROS). Methanolic extracts from broad beans (MEBB) contain phenolic compounds and have ROS-scavenging activities. In this study, we investigated the effects of MEBB on cellular growth and antioxidant levels in normal human lung fibroblasts. METHODS: To determine cytosolic superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, cytosolic glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities, catalase activities, reduced glutathione (GSH) concentrations, and growth rate, MEBB treatments were performed on young and old cells. RESULTS: In young and old cells treated with 120 μg/ml MEBB, the growth rates increased by 28.1 and 15.2%, respectively, compared with controls. The MEBB treatment of young cells caused a 62.5% increase in SOD activity, but the treatment of old cells caused a 39.5% decrease. The catalase activities of the young and old cells treated with MEBB were equal to those of control cells. Young and old cells treated with MEBB were equal to the control cells in terms of GSH-Px activity. The GSH concentrations in the young and old cells treated with 120 μg/ml MEBB increased by 22.1 and 45.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION: These studies elucidated a new cellular growth mechanism whereby human lung fibroblasts modulate intracellular GSH levels via the action of MEBB.

28849090|t|Overexpressed microRNA-506 and microRNA-124 alleviate H2O2-induced human cardiomyocyte dysfunction by targeting krüppel-like factor 4/5.
28849090|a|Krüppel-like factors (KLFs) regulate a wide variety of cellular functions and modulate pathological processes. In the present study, a post‑translational mechanism of microRNAs (miRs) was investigated in H2O2-induced human cardiomyocyte (HCM) injury. In H2O2‑cultured HCM cells, reactive oxygen species and apoptotic cells were measured via flow cytometry. miR‑506/‑124 mimics and inhibitors were transfected to induce gain or loss of miR‑506/‑124 function. Cell proliferation was analyzed by an MTT assay. The targeted genes were predicted by a bioinformatics algorithm and confirmed by a dual luciferase reporter assay. The mRNA and protein expression levels were measured by reverse transcription‑polymerse chain reaction analysis and western blotting, respectively. The results indicated that H2O2 induced significant apoptosis and increased the concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HCMs. H2O2 markedly upregulated the expression levels of KLF4 and KLF5, and downregulated the expression levels of miR‑506 and miR‑124 in the HCMs. In addition, bioinformatics analysis showed the potential miR‑506 and miR‑124 binding sites within the 3'‑untranslated region of KLF4 and KLF5 in the HCMs. The overexpression of miR‑506 and miR‑124 inhibited the H2O2‑induced upregulation of KLF4 and KLF5 in the HCMs. The overexpression of miR‑506 and miR‑214 reversed the H2O2‑induced apoptosis and increase of ROS in the HCMs. In conclusion, the overexpression of miR‑506 and miR‑214 were confirmed to have a protective effect against H2O2‑induced HCM injury by suppressing the expression of KLF4 and KLF5.

6615889|t|Changes in ascorbate levels on stimulation of human neutrophils.
6615889|a|Changes in ascorbate levels have been measured in human neutrophils stimulated with opsonized zymosan, phorbol myristate acetate and formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMet-Leu-Phe), in the presence and absence of cytochalasin B. After stimulation with opsonized zymosan or phorbol myristate acetate, there was no loss of total ascorbate, but 30-40% of the reduced ascorbate was oxidized to dehydroascorbate. Superoxide dismutase and catalase added to the cell suspension did not inhibit this oxidation. fMet-Leu-Phe, however, gave no net oxidation but about 20% of the total ascorbate was lost during 2 h incubation. These results imply that there is not a simple relationship between superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production and ascorbate oxidation, and that release of ascorbate into the phagolysosomes does not occur.

16867979|t|Examining interactions of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with single-stranded template nucleotides by nucleoside analog interference.
16867979|a|Crystallographic studies have implicated several residues of the p66 fingers subdomain of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 reverse transcriptase in contacting the single-stranded template overhang immediately ahead of the DNA polymerase catalytic center. This interaction presumably assists in inducing the appropriate geometry on the template base for efficient and accurate incorporation of the incoming dNTP. To investigate this, we introduced nucleoside analogs either individually or in tandem into the DNA template ahead of the catalytic center and investigated whether they induce pausing of the replication machinery before serving as the template base. Analogs included abasic tetrahydrofuran linkages, neutralizing methylphosphonate linkages, and conformationally locked nucleosides. In addition, several Phe-61 mutants were included in our analysis, based on previous data indicating that altering this residue affects both strand displacement synthesis and the fidelity of DNA synthesis. We demonstrate here that altering the topology of the template strand two nucleotides ahead of the catalytic center can interrupt DNA synthesis. Mutating Phe-61 to either Ala or Leu accentuates this defect, whereas replacement with an aromatic residue (Trp) allows the mutant enzyme to bypass the template analogs with relative ease.

932173|t|Intratesticular site of aromatization in the human.
932173|a|To determine the intratesticular site of aromatization, homogenates of separated seminiferous tubules and intact tissue from human testes were incubated with [3H] androstenedione or [3H] testosterone. [3H] Estrogens were isolated and identified, and the amounts synthesized were expressed as pmol/mg protein incubated. In testicular tissue from the three adult subjects investigated, the total estrogen per mg protein was 1.5-2.7 times greater in intact tissue than in isolated seminiferous tubules. This suggests that the major site of aromatization in human testes is the interstitial tissue. Estradiol was by far the major estrogenic product. No differences were observed in the amount of estrogens synthesized whether the substrate was androstenedione or testosterone.

8406545|t|An invertase with unusual properties secreted by sucrose-grown cells of Corynebacterium murisepticum.
8406545|a|The mode of sucrose utilisation by Corynebacterium murisepticum cells growing on M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.4% sucrose as the carbon source was studied. It was observed that during growth of this organism, sucrose in the medium is hydrolysed to glucose and fructose, suggesting the formation of an extracellular invertase. Unlike in other microorganisms (e.g. Saccharomyces cerevisiae) the invertase formation is not repressed by the presence of glucose in the medium. The invertase was found to be the only predominant extracellular protein in the culture broth and could be purified in a single step by precipitation at 90% ammonium sulphate saturation. The purified protein had a molecular mass of 70,000 daltons. It not only showed invertase activity, but also a fructosyltransferase activity as it could convert sucrose to beta-1,2-difructose, as well as to glucose and fructose.

10863994|t|Urinary dopamine excretion in healthy volunteers: effect of sodium diet and acute water load.
10863994|a|The present study was designed to investigate, in human subjects, urinary dopamine excretion under different conditions of sodium and water homeostasis. In a cross-over trial, ten healthy volunteers were subjected to low-salt (LS; dietary salt restriction, sodium chloride (NaCl) intake <5 g per day), normal-salt (NS; normal food ad libitum), and high-salt (HS; normal food plus NaCl 100 mg/kg per day) regimens for 8 days in a randomized order. On day 7, urine was collected for 24 h. The variations in urinary sodium excretion reflected the dietary salt intake (LS: 16.3+/-4.7; NS: 144.1+/-18.2; HS: 221.9+/-12.9 mmol 24 h(-1) 1.73 m(-2)), but were not accompanied by significant changes in urinary dopamine excretion. On day 8, clearance studies showed that an acute oral water load of 1500 ml did not alter glomerular filtration rate or renal plasma flow but significantly increased urinary flow rate without affecting dopamine excretion. Assuming that excreted dopamine is not metabolized or reabsorbed during the tubular passage, both the unchanged urinary dopamine output in spite of 14-fold variations in sodium excretion and its independence of an acute water load argue against the hypothesis that dopamine in the tubular lumen acts as a natriuretic and/or diuretic factor in humans.

9482721|t|The MEP2 ammonium permease regulates pseudohyphal differentiation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
9482721|a|In response to nitrogen starvation, diploid cells of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae differentiate into a filamentous, pseudohyphal growth form. This dimorphic transition is regulated by the Galpha protein GPA2, by RAS2, and by elements of the pheromone-responsive MAP kinase cascade, yet the mechanisms by which nitrogen starvation is sensed remain unclear. We have found that MEP2, a high affinity ammonium permease, is required for pseudohyphal differentiation in response to ammonium limitation. In contrast, MEP1 and MEP3, which are lower affinity ammonium permeases, are not required for filamentous growth. Deltamep2 mutant strains had no defects in growth rates or ammonium uptake, even at limiting ammonium concentrations. The pseudohyphal defect of Deltamep2/Deltamep2 strains was suppressed by dominant active GPA2 or RAS2 mutations and by addition of exogenous cAMP, but was not suppressed by activated alleles of the MAP kinase pathway. Analysis of MEP1/MEP2 hybrid proteins identified a small intracellular loop of MEP2 involved in the pseudohyphal regulatory function. In addition, mutations in GLN3, URE2 and NPR1, which abrogate MEP2 expression or stability, also conferred pseudohyphal growth defects. We propose that MEP2 is an ammonium sensor, generating a signal to regulate filamentous growth in response to ammonium starvation.

27124340|t|5'-Substituted Amiloride Derivatives as Allosteric Modulators Binding in the Sodium Ion Pocket of the Adenosine A2A Receptor.
27124340|a|The sodium ion site is an allosteric site conserved among many G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Amiloride 1 and 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)amiloride 2 (HMA) supposedly bind in this sodium ion site and can influence orthosteric ligand binding. The availability of a high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of the human adenosine A2A receptor (hA2AAR), in which the allosteric sodium ion site was elucidated, makes it an appropriate model receptor for investigating the allosteric site. In this study, we report the synthesis and evaluation of novel 5'-substituted amiloride derivatives as hA2AAR allosteric antagonists. The potency of the amiloride derivatives was assessed by their ability to displace orthosteric radioligand [(3)H]4-(2-((7-amino-2-(furan-2-yl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]-[1,3,5]triazin-5-yl)amino)ethyl)phenol ([(3)H]ZM-241,385) from both the wild-type and sodium ion site W246A mutant hA2AAR. 4-Ethoxyphenethyl-substituted amiloride 12l was found to be more potent than both amiloride and HMA, and the shift in potency between the wild-type and mutated receptor confirmed its likely binding to the sodium ion site.

14709802|t|Regulation of cell growth and expression of 7B2, PC2, and PC1/3 by TGFbeta 1 and sodium butyrate in a human pituitary cell line (HP75).
14709802|a|Recent studies have shown that 7B2 and the neuroendocrine- specific proconvertase PC2 have important roles in pituitary cell proliferation and hormone secretion. Studies from our laboratory have also shown that TGFb1 regulates anterior pituitary cell proliferation and hormone secretion. To study the regulation of 7B2 in human pituitary tumors, we used a cell line derived from a human pituitary adenoma (HP75) that has been shown to express 7B2, PC1, PC2, and TGFbeta receptors to analyze the effects of TGFbeta1 and the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) sodium butyrate (NaB) treatment on 7B2 mRNA expression along with the neuroendocrine-specific proconvertases 1/3 (PC1) and PC2 mRNA and protein expression. RNA was quantified by real-time PCR and proteins were detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Treatment of cells with 1 mM NaB or 1 nM TGF 1 for 4 d decreased cell proliferation with a concomitant increase in the cell cycle protein p21. Real-time PCR analysis showed a significant increase in 7B2 mRNA after NaB and TGFbeta1 treatment. PC2 mRNA was down regulated by NaB while PC1 mRNA was unchanged. TGFbeta1 stimulated PC1, but not PC2 mRNA levels. Changes in PC1 and PC2 protein were similar to changes in the mRNAs, but the differences were not significant. These results indicated that NaB and TGFbeta1 inhibit pituitary cell proliferation and regulate the expression of 7B2, PC1, and PC2 in a cell culture model of pituitary tumors. Our results also indicate that inhibition of pituitary cell proliferation is associated with increased expression of 7B2 mRNA.

6363296|t|Killing of human malaria parasites by macrophage secretory products.
6363296|a|The susceptibility of the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, to killing in vitro by macrophage secretory products was investigated. The effect of O2 radicals and tumor necrosis factor on parasite viability was assessed both morphologically and by following the uptake of [3H]hypoxanthine. H2O2 produced by the interaction of glucose and glucose oxidase was found to reduce viability; this effect was reversed by the addition of exogenous catalase. Further studies indicated that the catalase level within the erythrocyte was not altered upon parasite invasion. O2 radicals produced during the xanthine-xanthine oxidase interaction also killed P. falciparum. The addition of various O2 radical scavengers (including catalase) did not reverse this effect; therefore, it was not possible to determine which of the O2 radicals were involved in the killing process. Samples from three different sources containing tumor necrosis factor, a nonspecific soluble mediator derived from Mycobacterium bovis BCG-activated macrophages treated with endotoxin, also killed the parasite. There was no evidence that tumor necrosis factor or the products of the xanthine-xanthine oxidase interaction caused damage to the erythrocyte membrane that could be implicated as an important aspect of the killing process. These findings all strongly suggest that such macrophage products play an important role in immunity to malaria.

12906825|t|Structure of fully reduced bovine copper zinc superoxide dismutase at 1.15 A.
12906825|a|Copper zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) forms a crucial component of the cellular response to oxidative stress by catalyzing the dismutation of the superoxide radical to hydrogen peroxide and water. Mutations in human CuZnSOD are associated with the development of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (motor neuron disease). We have determined the structure of fully reduced bovine CuZnSOD to 1.15 A, the only atomic resolution structure for an intact CuZnSOD and one of only a small number for metalloproteins. For the first time, both subunits have been captured with the three coordinate Cu(I) ligation required by the generally accepted catalytic mechanism, where dismutation of the superoxide radical occurs via reduction of Cu. Furthermore, the improved resolution compared to previous studies (to 1.65 A) has allowed a more detailed examination of the metal center environment and its associated water network in the active site channel, facilitating the analysis of potential proton transfer routes.

17050668|t|Reactive oxygen species mediated sustained activation of protein kinase C alpha and extracellular signal-regulated kinase for migration of human hepatoma cell Hepg2.
17050668|a|The tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) can trigger growth inhibition, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like cell scattering, and migration of hepatoma cells HepG2 in a protein kinase C-alpha (PKC-alpha)-dependent manner. Saikosaponin a, an ingredient of antitumorigenic Chinese herb Sho-Saiko-to, inhibited cell growth but did not induce EMT-like cell scattering and cell migration of HepG2. Saikosaponin a and TPA induced transient (for 30 minutes) and sustained (until 6 hours) phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), respectively. Generation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) was induced by TPA, but not saikosaponin a, for 3 hours. As expected, scavengers of ROS, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and mannitol, and the thiol-containing antioxidant N-acetylcystein dramatically suppressed the TPA-triggered cell migration but not growth inhibition of HepG2. The generation of ROS induced by TPA was PKC, but not ERK, dependent. On the other hand, scavengers of ROS and N-acetylcystein also prevented PKC activation and ERK phosphorylation induced by TPA. On the transcriptional level, TPA can induce gene expression of integrins alpha5, alpha6, and beta1 and reduce gene expression of E-cahedrin in a PKC- and ROS-dependent manner. In conclusion, ROS play a central role in mediating TPA-triggered sustained PKC and ERK signaling for regulation of gene expression of integrins and E-cahedrin that are responsible for EMT and migration of HepG2.

11891467|t|The effect of gadolinium-based MRI contrast agents on the biodistribution of (67)Ga.
11891467|a|It has been reported that administration of the paramagnetic contrast agent Gd-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA, gadopentate) prior to 67Ga citrate could lead to poor quality scans, characterized by pronounced bone uptake and a loss of tumour avidity. Suggestions to account for this behaviour included in vivo dissociation or the presence of free DTPA in the formulation. The objective of this study was to assess this potential interference in 67Ga imaging using a mouse model. Commercial gadopentate and gadodiamide contrast agents at doses up to 5mmol*kg(-1) were injected into mature female Balb/c mice 4h before i.v. 67Ga citrate, then the biodistribution was determined at 24h. Gd-DTPA solutions containing excess Gd or DTPA were examined as well. The model was verified by identical studies using inactive Ga(III) or Fe(III) at 0.1mmol*kg(-1). The effects of Gd(III) or the DTPA ligand at this dose were also determined. Administration of Gd-DTPA was found to produce no marked changes in 67Ga biodistribution. Minor changes occurred after 0.1mmol*kg(-1) Gd(III) or the DTPA ligand, but could not account for the scan changes reported above. Inactive Ga(III) or Fe(III), as expected, caused a marked reduction of 67Ga uptake in all tissues except bone, leading to greatly increased total bone:total soft tissue ratios. It is concluded that Gd-DTPA or its constituents do not significantly alter the biodistribution of 67Ga citrate in mice. Extrapolating these findings to the human situation suggests that the previously reported scan changes may have been the result of other undetermined factors.

16415880|t|Crystal structure of Staphylococcus aureus tRNA adenosine deaminase TadA in complex with RNA.
16415880|a|Bacterial tRNA adenosine deaminases (TadAs) catalyze the hydrolytic deamination of adenosine to inosine at the wobble position of tRNA(Arg2), a process that enables this single tRNA to recognize three different arginine codons in mRNA. In addition, inosine is also introduced at the wobble position of multiple eukaryotic tRNAs. The genes encoding these deaminases are essential in bacteria and yeast, demonstrating the importance of their biological activity. Here we report the crystallization and structure determination to 2.0 A of Staphylococcus aureus TadA bound to the anticodon stem-loop of tRNA(Arg2) bearing nebularine, a non-hydrolyzable adenosine analog, at the wobble position. The cocrystal structure reveals the basis for both sequence and structure specificity in the interactions of TadA with RNA, and it additionally provides insight into the active site architecture that promotes efficient hydrolytic deamination.

8487305|t|A mutagenic study of the allosteric linkage of His(HC3)146 beta in haemoglobin.
8487305|a|We have examined the contribution of His(HC3)146 beta to the alkaline Bohr effect of human haemoglobin (HbA) by replacing it with Gln, using site-directed mutagenesis, and studying the structural and functional consequences. Oxygen equilibrium curves of the mutant show that the effect of pH on the oxygen affinity, the alkaline Bohr effect, is half that of HbA in the presence of chloride ion and less than 10% in its absence. Crystallographic analysis shows that the mutation introduced only small structural changes localized to the site of substitution, proving that the replacement of the hydrogen bond between the ionizable side-chain of His146 beta and Asp94 beta by a hydrogen bond between the unionizable side-chain of Gln146 beta and the same aspartate is solely responsible for the reduction of the alkaline Bohr effect. Our data confirm that His(HC3)146 beta is predominantly responsible for the chloride-independent component of the alkaline Bohr effect which results from the breaking of the hydrogen bond between His(HC3)146 beta and Asp(FG1)94 beta accompanying the transition from the quaternary deoxy to oxy-structure.

3950574|t|Modes of operation and variable stoichiometry of the furosemide- sensitive Na and K fluxes in human red cells.
3950574|a|We report in this paper different modes of Na and K transport in human red cells, which can be inhibited by furosemide in the presence of ouabain. Experimental evidence is provided for inward and outward coupled transport of Na and K, Ki/Ko and Nai/Nao exchange, and uncoupled Na or K efflux. The outward cotransport of Na and K was defined as the furosemide-sensitive (FS) component of Na and K effluxes into choline medium and as the Cl-dependent or cis-stimulated component of the ouabain-resistant (OR) Na and K effluxes. Inward cotransport of Na and K was defined by the stimulation by external Na (Nao) of the K influx and the stimulation by external K (Ko) of the Na influx in the presence of ouabain. Both effects were FS and Cl dependent. Experimental evidence for an FS Ki/Ko exchange pathway of the Na/K cotransport was provided by (a) the stimulation by external K of FS K influx and efflux, and (b) the stimulation by internal Na or K of FS K influx in the absence of external Na. Evidence for an FS Nai/Nao exchange pathway was provided by the stimulation of FS Na influx by internal Na from a K-free medium (130 mM NaCl). This pathway was four to six times smaller than the Ki/Ko exchange. In cells containing only Na or K, incubated in media containing only Na or K, respectively, there was FS efflux of the cation without simultaneous inward transport (FS uncoupled Na and K efflux). The stoichiometric ratio of FS outward cotransport of Na and K into choline medium varied with the ratio of Nai-to-Ki concentrations, and when Nai/Ki was close to 1, the ratio of FS outward Na to K flux was also 1. In choline media, FS Na efflux was inhibited by external K (noncompetitively), whereas FS k efflux was stimulated. The stimulation of FS K efflux was due to the stimulation by Ko of the Ki/Ko exchange pathway. Thus, the stoichiometry of FS Na and K effluxes also varied in the presence of external K. A minimal model for a reaction scheme of FS Na and K transport accounts for cis stimulation, trans inhibition, and trans stimulation, and for variable stoichiometry of the FS cation fluxes.

7729922|t|Lack of involvement of nitric oxide in killing of Aspergillus fumigatus conidia by pulmonary alveolar macrophages.
7729922|a|Nitric oxide is an important antimicrobial mechanism of phagocytes from mice and rats, but in the case of human phagocytes, secretion is still controversial. We investigated whether nitric oxide is involved in the killing of Aspergillus fumigatus conidia by human or murine pulmonary alveolar macrophages. Stimulation of the macrophages with gamma interferon and Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide had no effect on fungicidal activity against conidia in vitro, with or without the addition of tetrahydrobiopterin. Killing of conidia (means +/- standard deviations) by murine or human alveolar macrophages, before and after stimulation, was 44% +/- 13% and 49% +/- 12% (P = 0.34) and 24% +/- 5% and 29% +/- 10% (P = 0.20), respectively. Fungicidal activity was unaltered in the presence of the competitive inhibitor NG-monomethyl L-arginine, and nitrite was undetectable in cell supernatants. Peritoneal macrophages from B6C3F1 mice produced 18 mumol of nitrite per 10(6) cells in 18 h. In conclusion, nitric oxide does not appear to be involved in the fungicidal activity of murine or human alveolar macrophages against A. fumigatus conidia.

24963046|t|The Arg98Trp mutation in human VKORC1 causing VKCFD2 disrupts a di-arginine-based ER retention motif.
24963046|a|Vitamin K 2,3-epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) is an enzyme localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. VKORC1 catalyzes the reduction of vitamin K 2,3-epoxide to vitamin K and to vitamin K hydroquinone, the latter required by the enzyme γ-carboxylase for γ-carboxylation of all vitamin K-dependent (VKD) proteins. Until now, only 1 human VKORC1 mutation, p.Arg98Trp, is known to cause combined deficiency of VKD clotting factors type 2 (VKCFD2), a disease phenotype reported in 3 unrelated families. VKCFD2 patients suffer from spontaneous bleeding episodes because of decreased levels of γ-carboxylated VKD clotting factors. Daily supraphysiological vitamin K supplementation restores clotting for VKCFD2 patients and results in high serum levels of vitamin K 2,3-epoxide, suggesting that supplemented vitamin K is reduced in vivo. Although the p.Arg98Trp mutation results in reduced vitamin K 2,3-epoxide reductase activity, the molecular mechanism underlying this pathophysiology is unknown. Using a combination of in silico analysis and confocal microscopy, we demonstrate for the first time that VKORC1:p.Arg98Trp disrupts a di-arginine ER retention motif resulting in 20% ER colocalization only. As a consequence, VKORC1 exits the ER membrane by cellular quality control systems and results in the observed VKCFD2 phenotype.

21052751|t|Bacterial ferrochelatase turns human: Tyr13 determines the apparent metal specificity of Bacillus subtilis ferrochelatase.
21052751|a|Ferrochelatase catalyzes the insertion of Fe(2+) into protoporphyrin IX. The enzymatic product heme (protoheme IX) is a well-known cofactor in a wide range of proteins. The insertion of metal ions other than Fe(2+) occurs rarely in vivo, but all ferrochelatases that have been studied can insert Zn(2+) at a good rate in vitro. Co(2+), but not Cu(2+), is known to be a good substrate of the mammalian and Saccharomyces cerevisiae ferrochelatases. In contrast, Cu(2+), but not Co(2+), has been found to be a good substrate of bacterial Bacillus subtilis ferrochelatase. It is not known how ferrochelatase discriminates between different metal ion substrates. Structural analysis of B. subtilis ferrochelatase has shown that Tyr13 is an indirect ligand of Fe(2+) and a direct ligand of a copper mesoporphyrin product. A structure-based comparison revealed that Tyr13 aligns with a Met residue in the S. cerevisiae and human ferrochelatases. Tyr13 was changed to Met in the B. subtilis enzyme by site-directed mutagenesis. Enzymatic measurements showed that the modified enzyme inserted Co(2+) at a higher rate than the wild-type B. subtilis ferrochelatase, but it had lost the ability to use Cu(2+) as a substrate. Thus, the B. subtilis Tyr13Met ferrochelatase showed the same metal specificity as that of the ferrochelatases from S. cerevisiae and human.

21432234|t|Arsenic induces DNA damage via reactive oxygen species in human cells.
21432234|a|To elucidate arsenic-induced oxidative DNA damage, the genotoxicity of arsenic in human cells was comparatively studied with single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay in combination with the observation of the protective effects of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and catalase. Arsenic, at the concentration of 2.4 μM by coincubation for 24 hours, significantly induced DNA damage in HL60, a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line. In contrast, significant DNA damage was found in human mononucleocytes at the concentration of 4.8 μM or above. The cells were incubated separately with DMSO (12 mM/l), a well-known hydroxyl radical (OH(-)) scavenger, and catalase (1,300 U/ml), a hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) scavenger, for 6 hours and then further coincubated with various concentrations of arsenic for 24 hours at 37°C and 5% CO(2). The findings showed that both DMSO and catalase significantly reduced the arsenic-induced tail moment, a parameter of total damaged DNA, in HL60 and mononucleocytes. Hence our findings indicate that arsenic, with micromolar concentrations, induces typical and various extents of DNA damage in human cells via reactive oxygen species in a dose-dependent manner.

12239430|t|Pro- and anti-apoptotic effects of nitric oxide in irradiated keratinocytes: the role of superoxide.
12239430|a|Ultraviolet radiation (UV) induces apoptosis in keratinocytes by both p53- and death receptor-dependent pathways. It also generates free radicals in keratinocytes, including the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) by constitutive and inducible NO synthases (NOS). NO has both pro- and anti-apoptotic effects. We wished to determine which of these was predominant in keratinocytes. Human CCD1106 keratinocytes were irradiated with UVB in the presence and absence of several NOS antagonists. Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry with annexin V binding. NOS antagonism consistently altered UVB-induced apoptosis measured 18 h after irradiation. In 9 of 13 experiments, NOS antagonism increased apoptosis. However, in 4 of 13 experiments, NOS antagonism reduced apoptosis. We postulated that the variable effects of NO might be due to a critical balance between UVB-induced NO and superoxide production. We predicted that NO would be anti-apoptotic in the presence of low O(-)(2), but pro-apoptotic when NO combined with O(-)(2) to form peroxynitrite. Though superoxide dismutase reduced apoptosis after UVB, addition of peroxynitrite did not affect apoptosis. We conclude that NO released by UV irradiation is anti-apoptotic; however, the levels of O(-)(2) may be a determinant of NO action.

25767685|t|Galangin (3,5,7-trihydroxyflavone) shields human keratinocytes from ultraviolet B-induced oxidative stress.
25767685|a|Most skin damage caused by ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation is owing to the generation of reactive oxygen species. Phytochemicals can act as antioxidants against UVB-induced oxidative stress. This study investigated the protective effects of the flavone galangin against UVB-induced oxidative damage in human keratinocytes. Galangin efficiently scavenged free radicals and reduced UVB-induced damage to cellular macromolecules, such as DNA, lipids, and proteins. Furthermore, galangin rescued cells undergoing apoptosis induced by UVB radiation via recovering mitochondrial polarization and down-regulating apoptotic proteins. These results showed that galangin protects human keratinocytes against UVB radiation-induced cellular damage and apoptosis via its antioxidant effects.

20840591|t|Evidence for the slow reaction of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase 2 with oxygen.
20840591|a|The response of animals to hypoxia is mediated by the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor. Human hypoxia-inducible factor is regulated by four Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases: prolyl hydroxylase domain enzymes 1-3 catalyse hydroxylation of two prolyl-residues in hypoxia-inducible factor, triggering its degradation by the proteasome. Factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor catalyses the hydroxylation of an asparagine-residue in hypoxia-inducible factor, inhibiting its transcriptional activity. Collectively, the hypoxia-inducible factor hydroxylases negatively regulate hypoxia-inducible factor in response to increasing oxygen concentration. Prolyl hydroxylase domain 2 is the most important oxygen sensor in human cells; however, the underlying kinetic basis of the oxygen-sensing function of prolyl hydroxylase domain 2 is unclear. We report analyses of the reaction of prolyl hydroxylase domain 2 with oxygen. Chemical quench/MS experiments demonstrate that reaction of a complex of prolyl hydroxylase domain 2, Fe(II), 2-oxoglutarate and the C-terminal oxygen-dependent degradation domain of hypoxia-inducible factor-α with oxygen to form hydroxylated C-terminal oxygen-dependent degradation domain and succinate is much slower (approximately 100-fold) than for other similarly studied 2-oxoglutarate oxygenases. Stopped flow/UV-visible spectroscopy experiments demonstrate that the reaction produces a relatively stable species absorbing at 320 nm; Mössbauer spectroscopic experiments indicate that this species is likely not a Fe(IV)=O intermediate, as observed for other 2-oxoglutarate oxygenases. Overall, the results obtained suggest that, at least compared to other studied 2-oxoglutarate oxygenases, prolyl hydroxylase domain 2 reacts relatively slowly with oxygen, a property that may be associated with its function as an oxygen sensor.

15831490|t|Two-step mechanism that determines the donor binding specificity of human UDP-N-acetylhexosaminyltransferase.
15831490|a|In its x-ray crystal structures, alpha-1,4-N-acteylhexosaminyltransferase (exostosin-like protein 2 (EXTL2)) forms no direct interaction with the N-acetyl group of the UDP-N-acetylhexosamine. Mutation of the residues that interact with the hydroxyl groups of the donor not only failed to abrogate donor binding but in fact increased binding affinity. Isothermal titration calorimetry is now used to examine the binding nature of various UDP-sugars in H2O and D2O solutions. UDP-N-acetylhexosamines bind to EXTL2 with a high affinity in both solutions, resulting in a relatively large increase of entropy, whereas the weak binding of UDP-galactose and -glucose, which occurred only in D2O solution, only slightly increased entropy. Thus, specific donor binding appears to undergo two distinct steps, beginning with the N-acetyl group expelling water from the donor. enzyme complex into the bulk solvent followed by positioning of the donor into the binding site for the subsequent interactions with the enzyme.

20028335|t|Ref2, a regulatory subunit of the yeast protein phosphatase 1, is a novel component of cation homoeostasis.
20028335|a|Maintenance of cation homoeostasis is a key process for any living organism. Specific mutations in Glc7, the essential catalytic subunit of yeast protein phosphatase 1, result in salt and alkaline pH sensitivity, suggesting a role for this protein in cation homoeostasis. We screened a collection of Glc7 regulatory subunit mutants for altered tolerance to diverse cations (sodium, lithium and calcium) and alkaline pH. Among 18 candidates, only deletion of REF2 (RNA end formation 2) yielded increased sensitivity to these conditions, as well as to diverse organic toxic cations. The Ref2F374A mutation, which renders it unable to bind Glc7, did not rescue the salt-related phenotypes of the ref2 strain, suggesting that Ref2 function in cation homoeostasis is mediated by Glc7. The ref2 deletion mutant displays a marked decrease in lithium efflux, which can be explained by the inability of these cells to fully induce the Na+-ATPase ENA1 gene. The effect of lack of Ref2 is additive to that of blockage of the calcineurin pathway and might disrupt multiple mechanisms controlling ENA1 expression. ref2 cells display a striking defect in vacuolar morphogenesis, which probably accounts for the increased calcium levels observed under standard growth conditions and the strong calcium sensitivity of this mutant. Remarkably, the evidence collected indicates that the role of Ref2 in cation homoeostasis may be unrelated to its previously identified function in the formation of mRNA via the APT (for associated with Pta1) complex.

24975985|t|In vitro expression of Candida albicans alcohol dehydrogenase genes involved in acetaldehyde metabolism.
24975985|a|Alcohol consumption is a risk factor for oral cancer, possibly via its conversion to acetaldehyde, a known carcinogen. The oral commensal yeast Candida albicans may be one of the agents responsible for this conversion intra-orally. The alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) family of enzymes are involved in acetaldehyde metabolism in yeast but, for C. albicans it is not known which family member is responsible for the conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde. In this study we determined the expression of mRNAs from three C. albicans Adh genes (CaADH1, CaADH2 and CaCDH3) for cells grown in different culture media at different growth phases by Northern blot analysis and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. CaADH1 was constitutively expressed under all growth conditions but there was differential expression of CaADH2. CaADH3 expression was not detected. To investigate whether CaAdh1p or CaAdh2p can contribute to alcohol catabolism in C. albicans, each gene from the reference strain C. albicans SC5314 was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cell extracts from an CaAdh1p-expressing S. cerevisiae recombinant, but not an CaAdh2p-expressing recombinant, or an empty vector control strain, possessed ethanol-utilizing Adh activity above endogenous S. cerevisiae activity. Furthermore, expression of C. albicans Adh1p in a recombinant S. cerevisiae strain in which the endogenous ScADH2 gene (known to convert ethanol to acetaldehyde in this yeast) had been deleted, conferred an NAD-dependent ethanol-utilizing, and so acetaldehyde-producing, Adh activity. We conclude that CaAdh1p is the enzyme responsible for ethanol use under in vitro growth conditions, and may contribute to the intra-oral production of acetaldehyde.

9059828|t|Effects of catholytes on the mobilization of proteins after capillary isoelectric focusing.
9059828|a|Purified proteins and human plasma proteins were separated by capillary isoelectric focusing and detected by cathodic mobilization, e.g. by replacing the cathodic sodium hydroxide solution by solutions containing another anion. The effect of catholyte anions on the resolution of mobilized proteins was examined. Compared with the chloride or phosphate anion, organic anions having small dissociation constants improved protein resolution, especially in the range of acidic proteins. Among the catholytes examined, acetic acid gave the best resolution for purified proteins and human plasma proteins. Measurement of the changes of electric current during the mobilization process indicated that organic anions with low mobility move slowly towards the anode and retard changes of pH gradient in the capillary. Isoelectric focusing, cathodic mobilization, and direct pH measurement in polyacrylamide gel columns (1.3 mm internal diameter and 38 mm long) also revealed these effects of low mobility anions. In order to visualize the behavior of human plasma proteins in the mobilization step, micro two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was employed. The results indicated that the proteins migrate towards the cathode, preserving their relative positions attained during the isoelectric focusing step.

19531636|t|Sonic hedgehog improves delayed wound healing via enhancing cutaneous nitric oxide function in diabetes.
19531636|a|Sonic hedgehog (SHH) plays an important role in postnatal tissue repair. The present study tested the hypothesis that impaired SHH pathway results in delayed wound healing by suppressing cutaneous nitric oxide (NO) function in type 1 diabetes. Adult male C57/B6 mice and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetic mice were used. Although cutaneous SHH and Patched-1 (Ptc-1 encoded by PTCH, PTCH 1) proteins were increased significantly on day 4 after wounding compared with day 0 in normal mice, both were decreased significantly in STZ-induced diabetic mice. Topical application of SHH restored wound healing delay in STZ-induced diabetic mice, with a concomitant augmentation of both cutaneous constitutive nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity and nitrite level. The effects of SHH on wound healing and cutaneous NO function were markedly inhibited by SHH receptor inhibitor cyclopamine. After 24-h treatment in vitro, SHH (5-20 microg/ml) significantly increased cutaneous endothelial NOS protein expression, NOS activity and NO level in normal mice and STZ-induced diabetic mice in a concentration-dependent manner, an effect that was blunted by cyclopamine and NOS inhibitor N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY-294002 significantly blunted the increase of NOS activity and NO level induced by SHH treatment in human umbilican vein endothelial cells. These results demonstrate that the SHH pathway is activated in a normal wound, and its reduction results in impaired NO function and wound healing in diabetes. Strategies aimed at augmenting the endogenous SHH pathway may provide an effective means in ameliorating delayed diabetic wound healing.

1645286|t|Cultured human keratinocytes cannot metabolize vitamin D3 to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3.
1645286|a|The metabolism of [3H]vitamin D3 was studied in cultured human keratinocytes (CHK). Intact CHK were incubated for 1, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h with [3H]vitamin D3 and the lipid soluble fractions from the media and cells were extracted by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Vitamin D3 and its metabolites, 25-OH-D3, 24,25(OH)2D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3 were added to the extracts, as markers, prior to HPLC. HPLC analysis of the lipid extracts did not reveal any monohydroxylated metabolites. CHK incubated for one hour with [3H]25-OH-D3 showed a 10 +/- 4% conversion to [3H]1,25(OH)2D3 whereas no conversion to [3H]1,25(OH)2D3 was observed in control CHKs that were boiled prior to incubation with [3H]25-OH-D3. These findings suggest that cultured neonatal keratinocytes are incapable of metabolizing vitamin D3 to 25-OH-D3.

10488982|t|Carbon dioxide exchange via the mucosa in healthy middle ear.
10488982|a|BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that gas exchange via the middle ear mucosa, which is performed between the middle ear cleft and capillaries in the submucosal connective tissue, has an essential role in ventilation and pressure regulation in the middle ear cleft. We speculated that gas exchange via the mucosa is induced by the gas diffusion caused by the partial pressure gradient of gas between the middle ear cleft and submucosal capillaries. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the capacity of the gas exchange via the mucosa in the healthy middle ear of humans by examining the effect of the respiratory mode on middle ear pressure. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We selected 13 volunteers ranging in age from 25 to 44 years with healthy ear drums and type A tympanograms. Middle ear pressure was measured in 1 ear of each subject every 2 minutes using tympanometry while the respiratory mode was altered, with the subject in the supine position. RESULTS: The partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the venous blood (PvCO2) and middle ear pressure were decreased by hyperventilation and increased by hypoventilation. The partial pressure of oxygen in the venous blood showed little change. CONCLUSIONS: Carbon dioxide diffused into the blood from the middle ear cleft in accord with the partial pressure gradient when the PvCO2 was reduced by hyperventilation, resulting in a decrease of middle ear pressure, whereas CO2 diffused into the middle ear cleft when the PvCO2 was elevated by hypoventilation, resulting in an increase of middle ear pressure. These findings suggest that a bidirectional CO2 exchange via the middle ear mucosa functions in the normal human middle ear.

6199427|t|Measurement of the respiratory burst in human monocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes by nitro blue tetrazolium reduction and chemiluminescence.
6199427|a|We compared measurements of chemiluminescence (CL) assessing the rate of production of oxygen intermediates at a given instance, and of nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction detecting total superoxide produced during the assay period, for the assessment of the respiratory burst of both human monocytes (M phi) and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). In the CL experiments, opsonized and non-opsonized zymosan was used to stimulate peripheral blood M phi and PMN. Opsonized zymosan yielded an earlier and 2-fold higher peak response than non-opsonized zymosan. The stimulatory action of zymosan in CL varied with the time of incubation and depended on the concentration of cells and zymosan. No light generation was observed in the absence of viable cells. In contrast to NBT reduction, incubation of PMN with dextran sulfate did not result in increased light generation but rather in a quenching of the response in CL. Opsonized zymosan also yielded a higher level of NBT reduction than non-opsonized zymosan. Comparing NBT reduction with CL in 21 healthy individuals, with 2 X 10(5) M phi and 2.5 X 10(5) PMN for NBT and 5 X 10(5) PMN for CL tests, we found that NBT brings about spontaneous oxidative metabolism, possibly reflecting the intracellular compartment, the chemiluminescent response of resting cells being only marginal. The data suggest higher sensitivity of the CL method. These results provide useful comparative data for 2 established methods used to document the respiratory burst in phagocytic cells.

6951874|t|Effects in postmenopausal women of natural and synthetic estrogens on calcitonin and calcium-regulating hormone secretion. Relevance to postmenopausal osteoporosis.
6951874|a|The major function of calcitonin in man appears to be the prevention of excessive or unwanted bone resorption. There is a marked sex difference in circulating levels, with a relative deficiency in women. As calcitonin secretion in young women is known to be increased by estrogens, long periods of estrogen lack - such as the postmenopause - are possibly associated with a more pronounced calcitonin deficiency. This exaggerated deficiency could be an important factor in the pathogenesis of postmenopausal bone loss, especially as the latter is believed to be due to excessive bone resorption. We have studied the effects of three exogenous estrogens on the circulating levels in postmenopausal women of calcitonin, parathyroid hormone, the vitamin D metabolites 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D and 25 hydroxyvitamin D, and calcium and phosphate. The most striking finding was a sharp rise in the plasma levels of calcitonin. Estrogens are known to prevent postmenopausal bone loss but the mechanism of action remains obscure. We suggest that the beneficial effects of estrogens could be mediated, at least in part, through control of calcitonin secretion. Thus calcitonin may prove effective in the prevention of postmenopausal bone loss and its role in the treatment of established osteoporosis warrants further evaluation.

1064133|t|Route of infection in extrahepatic biliary tract disease. II: Bacterial recovery from gallbladder bile and gallbladder wall in human biliary tract disease.
1064133|a|Bacterial recovery from gallbladder wall and gallbladder bile was investigated in 73 patients with extrahepatic biliary tract diseases. The technique of anaerobic culture was based on the use of a 'glove-box' and prereduced anaerobically sterilized media. Transport of samples was based on evacuation of atmospheric air with oxygen-free carbon dioxide and a transport time less than 30 minutes. When samples of bile and tissue were obtained simultaneously before operations on the biliary tract were begun and handled by one of the authors to avoid contamination, no significant difference in bacterial recovery between bile and tissue was observed. If samples were handled routinely by the staff or if biopsy from the gallbladder wall was not obtained until after operation on the biliary tract was finished, bacterial recovery from gallbladder tissue was significantly more frequent compared to bile. Under these last mentioned circumstances, the difference in bacterial recovery was due to bacterial species like Staph. aureus, Staph. albus, P. acnes and Difteroids.

27629886|t|Serelaxin improves the pathophysiology of placental ischemia in the reduced uterine perfusion pressure rat model of preeclampsia.
27629886|a|Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that has limited therapeutic options. In healthy pregnancy, relaxin plays an important vasodilatory role to maintain vascular compliance; however, currently, there is no preclinical evidence to support the use of relaxin during preeclampsia. Therefore, the goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that recombinant human relaxin-2 (Serelaxin, Novartis; RLX) could reduce mean arterial pressure (MAP) and improve uterine artery resistance index (UARI) and nitric oxide bioavailability, and/or decrease prepro-endothelin-1 (PPET-1), soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), and TNF-α) in the reduced uterine perfusion pressure (RUPP) model of preeclampsia. On day 14 of gestation (GD14), pregnant rats were assigned to normal pregnant (NP), RUPP, RUPP+RLX, or NP+RLX groups. Treated rats received RLX at 0.4 μg/h or RLX2 4 μg/h RLX via minipump implanted on GD14. On GD18, carotid arterial catheters were inserted, and on GD19, MAP and tissues were collected. MAP was increased in RUPP rats compared with NP but was lowered with either dose of RLX. UARI and sFlt-1 were significantly improved in both treated RUPP groups. Total circulating nitrate-nitrite improved and placental PPET-1 and TNF-α were significantly decreased with the higher dose of RLX. Renal cortex PPET-1 was reduced with both doses of RLX. In conclusion, Serelaxin improved blood pressure, sFlt-1, TNF-α, UARI, and nitric oxide bioavailability and PPET-1 in a rat model of preeclampsia, thereby suggesting a potential therapeutic role for RLX in maintaining maternal health and prolonging pregnancy in the face of placental ischemia.

21272923|t|The Feverfew plant-derived compound, parthenolide enhances platelet production and attenuates platelet activation through NF-κB inhibition.
21272923|a|INTRODUCTION: Few treatments are available that can safely and effectively stimulate new platelet production for thrombocytopenic patients. Additionally, recipients of transfused platelets may experience an inflammatory response due to stored platelets becoming unnecessarily activated, thus creating the need for suitable agents that will dampen undesirable platelet activation. We investigated the effect of the feverfew plant-derived compound, parthenolide on platelet production and platelet activation because of its well-studied ability to induce apoptosis or differentiation in some types of cancer. METHODS: Parthenolide was used to treat human megakaryoblastic cell lines, primary human and mouse megakaryocytes. Resulting platelet production and function was measured via flow cytometry. The two most common parthenolide signaling mechanisms, oxidative stress and nuclear factor-κB inhibition, were assessed within the megakaryocytes using reactive oxygen species, glutathione and luciferase reporter assays. The influence of parthenolide on ex vivo platelet activation was tested with parthenolide pretreatment followed by collagen or thrombin activation. The resulting P-selectin surface expression and released soluble CD40 ligand was measured. RESULTS: Parthenolide stimulates functional platelet production from human megakaryocyte cell lines, and from primary mouse and human megakaryocytes in vitro. Parthenolide enhances platelet production via inhibition of nuclear factor-κB signaling in megakaryocytes and is independent of the parthenolide-induced oxidative stress response. Additionally, parthenolide treatment of human peripheral blood platelets attenuated activation of stimulated platelets. CONCLUSION: Overall, these data reveal that parthenolide has strong potential as a candidate to enhance platelet production and to dampen undesirable platelet activation.

3309176|t|Changes in 45Ca and 109Cd uptake, membrane potential and cell pH in Saccharomyces cerevisiae provoked by Cd2+.
3309176|a|The effect of Cd2+ poisoning of Saccharomyces cerevisiae on 45Ca, 109Cd and [14C]tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP) uptake and cell pH was examined. At Cd2+ concentrations that produced substantial K+ efflux the rates of uptake of 45Ca, 109Cd and [14C]TPP increased progressively during incubation of the cells with Cd2+, and the cell pH was lowered concomitantly. The initial rates of uptake of the divalent cations and of TPP were increased in cells pre-loaded with Cd2+, which shows that stimulation of the ion fluxes was exerted by the Cd2+ that accumulated in the cells. The distribution ratio of TPP between cells and medium, however, was decreased by Cd2+. Although hyperpolarization of the cell membrane by Cd2+ cannot be excluded, it is argued that Cd2+ primarily stimulated divalent cation uptake by increasing the cation permeability of the cell membrane allowing the cations to enter the cells more easily.

3549699|t|The SNF3 gene is required for high-affinity glucose transport in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
3549699|a|Glucose uptake mutants have not been previously obtained in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, possibly because there seem to be at least two transport systems, of low and high affinities. We showed that snf3 (sucrose nonfermenting) mutants did not express high-affinity glucose uptake. Furthermore, their growth was completely impaired on low concentrations of glucose in the presence of antimycin A (which blocks respiration). Several genes which complemented the original snf3 gene were obtained on multicopy plasmids. Some of them, as well as plasmid-carried SNF3 itself, conferred a substantial increase in high-affinity glucose uptake in both snf3 and wild-type hosts. The effects of glucose on the expression of such a plasmid-determined high-affinity uptake resembled those in the wild type. Other genes complementing snf3 seemed to cause an increase in low-affinity glucose uptake. We suggest that SNF3 may function specifically in high-affinity glucose uptake, which is needed under some conditions of growth on low glucose concentrations. SNF3 itself or the other complementing genes may specify components of the glucose uptake system.

861126|t|The effect of carbidopa administration on urinary sodium excretion in man. Is dopamine an intrarenal natriuretic hormone?
861126|a|1 Carbidopa, a known inhibitor of the peripheral conversion of dopa to dopamine, was given to six normal volunteers to examine the effect of interference with dopamine synthesis on urinary sodium excretion. 2 On the first day of administration, carbidopa caused a significant fall not only in urinary dopamine excretion (P less than 0.01) but also in urinary sodium excretion (P less than 0.05). 3 A highly significant correlation was also found between mean sodium excretion and mean dopamine excretion in the days prior to and during carbidopa administration (r = 0.617, P less than 0.001; 4 = 0.764, P less than 0.001 respectively). 4 The significance of these findings is discussed and it is proposed that dopamine may be an important intrarenal natriuretic hormone.

28856407|t|pH homeostasis in yeast; the phosphate perspective.
28856407|a|Recent research further clarified the molecular mechanisms that link nutrient signaling and pH homeostasis with the regulation of growth and survival of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The central nutrient signaling kinases PKA, TORC1, and Sch9 are intimately associated to pH homeostasis, presumably allowing them to concert far-reaching phenotypical repercussions of nutritional cues. To exemplify such repercussions, we briefly describe consequences for phosphate uptake and signaling and outline interactions between phosphate homeostasis and the players involved in intra- and extracellular pH control. Inorganic phosphate uptake, its subcellular distribution, and its conversion into polyphosphates are dependent on the proton gradients created over different membranes. Conversely, polyphosphate metabolism appears to contribute in determining the intracellular pH. Additionally, inositol pyrophosphates are emerging as potent determinants of growth potential, in this way providing feedback from phosphate metabolism onto the central nutrient signaling kinases. All these data point towards the importance of phosphate metabolism in the reciprocal regulation of nutrient signaling and pH homeostasis.

15947285|t|Sildenafil improves alveolar growth and pulmonary hypertension in hyperoxia-induced lung injury.
15947285|a|RATIONALE: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the chronic lung disease of preterm infants, and pulmonary emphysema, both significant global health problems, are characterized by an arrest in alveolar growth/loss of alveoli structures. Mechanisms that inhibit distal lung growth are poorly understood, but recent studies suggest that impaired vascular endothelial growth factor signaling and reduced nitric oxide (NO) production decreases alveolar and vessel growth in the developing lung, features observed in experimental oxygen-induced BPD. NO exerts its biological activity by stimulating guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) production. OBJECTIVES: Because cGMP is inactivated by phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes, we hypothesized that the cGMP-specific PDE5 inhibitor sildenafil would promote angiogenesis and attenuate oxygen-induced lung injury in newborn rats. METHODS, MEASUREMENTS, AND MAIN RESULTS: In vitro, sildenafil (10(-4) M) increased endothelial capillary network formation of human pulmonary endothelial cells exposed to hyperoxia. In vivo, rat pups were randomly exposed from birth to normoxia, hyperoxia (95% O(2), BPD model), and hyperoxia+sildenafil (100 mg/kg/day subcutaneously). Rat pups exposed to hyperoxia showed fewer and enlarged air spaces as well as decreased capillary density, mimicking pathologic features seen in human BPD. These structural anomalies were associated with echographic (decreased pulmonary acceleration time) and structural (right ventricular hypertrophy and increased medial wall thickness) signs of pulmonary hypertension. Sildenafil preserved alveolar growth and lung angiogenesis, and decreased pulmonary vascular resistance, right ventricular hypertrophy and medial wall thickness. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a role for the NO/cGMP pathway during alveolar development. Sildenafil may have therapeutic potential in diseases associated with impaired alveolar structures.

6681985|t|D-Glucose-sensitive and -insensitive cytochalasin B binding proteins from microvillous plasma membranes of human placenta. Identification of the D-glucose transporter.
6681985|a|Cytochalasin B was found to bind to at least two distinct sites in human placental microvillous plasma membrane vesicles, one of which is likely to be intimately associated with the glucose transporter. These sites were distinguished by the specificity of agents able to displace bound cytochalasin B. [3H]Cytochalasin B was displaceable at one site by D-glucose but not by dihydrocytochalasin B; it was displaceable from the other by dihydrocytochalasin B but not by D-glucose. Some binding which could not be displaced by D-glucose + cytochalasin B binding site. Cytochalasin B can be photoincorporated into specific binding proteins by ultraviolet irradiation. D-Glucose specifically prevented such photoaffinity labeling of a microvillous protein component(s) of Mr = 60,000 +/- 2000 as determined by urea-sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide gel electrophoresis. This D-glucose-sensitive cytochalasin B binding site of the placenta is likely to be either the glucose transporter or be intimately associated with it. The molecular weight of the placental glucose transporter agrees well with the most widely accepted molecular weight for the human erythrocyte glucose transporter. Dihydrocytochalasin B prevented the photoincorporation of [3H]cytochalasin B into a polypeptide(s) of Mr = 53,000 +/- 2000. This component is probably not associated with placental glucose transport. This report presents the first identification of a sodium-independent glucose transporter from a normal human tissue other than the erythrocyte. It also presents the first molecular weight identification of a human glucose-insensitive high-affinity cytochalasin B binding protein.

25880514|t|Nitric oxide and the cardiovascular system.
25880514|a|Nitric oxide (NO) generated by endothelial cells to relax vascular smooth muscle is one of the most intensely studied molecules in the past 25 years. Much of what is known about NO regulation of NO is based on blockade of its generation and analysis of changes in vascular regulation. This approach has been useful to demonstrate the importance of NO in large scale forms of regulation but provides less information on the nuances of NO regulation. However, there is a growing body of studies on multiple types of in vivo measurement of NO in normal and pathological conditions. This discussion will focus on in vivo studies and how they are reshaping the understanding of NO's role in vascular resistance regulation and the pathologies of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The role of microelectrode measurements in the measurement of [NO] will be considered because much of the controversy about what NO does and at what concentration depends upon the measurement methodology. For those studies where the technology has been tested and found to be well founded, the concept evolving is that the stresses imposed on the vasculature in the form of flow-mediated stimulation, chemicals within the tissue, and oxygen tension can cause rapid and large changes in the NO concentration to affect vascular regulation. All these functions are compromised in both animal and human forms of hypertension and diabetes mellitus due to altered regulation of endothelial cells and formation of oxidants that both damage endothelial cells and change the regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase.

15514163|t|Protein kinase D is a novel mediator of cardiac troponin I phosphorylation and regulates myofilament function.
15514163|a|Protein kinase D (PKD) is a serine kinase whose myocardial substrates are unknown. Yeast 2-hybrid screening of a human cardiac library, using the PKD catalytic domain as bait, identified cardiac troponin I (cTnI), myosin-binding protein C (cMyBP-C), and telethonin as PKD-interacting proteins. In vitro phosphorylation assays revealed PKD-mediated phosphorylation of cTnI, cMyBP-C, and telethonin, as well as myomesin. Peptide mass fingerprint analysis of cTnI by liquid chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry indicated PKD-mediated phosphorylation of a peptide containing Ser22 and Ser23, the protein kinase A (PKA) targets. Ser22 and Ser23 were replaced by Ala, either singly (Ser22Ala or Ser23Ala) or jointly (Ser22/23Ala), and the troponin complex reconstituted in vitro, using wild-type or mutated cTnI together with wild-type cardiac troponin C and troponin T. PKD-mediated cTnI phosphorylation was reduced in complexes containing Ser22Ala or Ser23Ala cTnI and completely abolished in the complex containing Ser22/23Ala cTnI, indicating that Ser22 and Ser23 are both targeted by PKD. Furthermore, troponin complex containing wild-type cTnI was phosphorylated with similar kinetics and stoichiometry (approximately 2 mol phosphate/mol cTnI) by both PKD and PKA. To determine the functional impact of PKD-mediated phosphorylation, Ca2+ sensitivity of tension development was studied in a rat skinned ventricular myocyte preparation. PKD-mediated phosphorylation did not affect maximal tension but produced a significant rightward shift of the tension-pCa relationship, indicating reduced myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity. At submaximal Ca2+ activation, PKD-mediated phosphorylation also accelerated isometric crossbridge cycling kinetics. Our data suggest that PKD is a novel mediator of cTnI phosphorylation at the PKA sites and may contribute to the regulation of myofilament function.

15708515|t|Solar radiation, vitamin D and survival rate of colon cancer in Norway.
15708515|a|Solar radiation contributes significantly to the status of serum calcidiol (25-hydroxyvitamin D3, 25-(OH)D3) in humans, even at the high latitudes of northern Norway. Thus, in late summer the serum concentration of calcidiol is roughly 50% larger than that in late winter, when the solar radiation in Norway contains too little ultraviolet radiation to induce any synthesis of vitamin D3 in human skin. This seems to influence the prognosis of colon cancer. We here report that the survival rate of colon cancer in men and women, assessed 18 months after diagnosis, is dependent on the season of diagnosis. A high serum concentration of calcidiol at the time of diagnosis, i.e. at the start of conventional therapy, seems to give an increased survival rate. This agrees with cell and animal experiments reported in the literature, as well as with epidemiological data from some countries relating colon cancer survival with latitude and vitamin D3 synthesis in skin. One possible interpretation of the present data is that, the level of calcidiol, or its derivative calcitriol (1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, 1alpha,25-(OH)2D3), may act positively in concert with conventional therapies of colon cancer.

15579623|t|Effects of transgene expression of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase on pulmonary epithelial cell growth in hyperoxia.
15579623|a|Prolonged exposure to supraphysiological oxygen concentrations results in the generation of reactive oxygen species, which can cause significant lung injury in critically ill patients. Supplementation with human recombinant antioxidant enzymes (AOE) may mitigate hyperoxic lung injury, but it is unclear which combination and concentration will optimally protect pulmonary epithelial cells. First, stable cell lines were generated in alveolar epithelial cells (MLE12) overexpressing one or more of the following AOE: Mn superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), CuZnSOD, or glutathione peroxidase 1. Next, A549 cells were transduced with 50-300 particles/cell of recombinant adenovirus containing either LacZ or each of the three AOE (alone or in combination). Cells were then exposed to 95% O(2) for up to 3 days, with cell number and viability determined daily. Overexpression of either MnSOD (primarily mitochondrial) or CuZnSOD (primarily cytosolic) reversed the growth inhibitory effects of hyperoxia within the first 48 h of exposure, resulting in a significant increase in viable cells (P < 0.05), with 1.5- to 3-fold increases in activity providing optimal protection. Protection from mitochondrial oxidation was confirmed by assessing aconitase activity, which was significantly improved in cells overexpressing MnSOD (P < 0.05). Data indicate that optimal protection from hyperoxic injury occurs in cells coexpressing MnSOD and glutathione peroxidase 1, with prevention of mitochondrial oxidation being a critical factor. This has important implications for clinical trials in preterm infants receiving SOD supplementation to prevent acute and chronic lung injury.

3980438|t|Glycerol metabolism and osmoregulation in the salt-tolerant yeast Debaryomyces hansenii.
3980438|a|A glycerol-nonutilizing mutant of the salt-tolerant yeast Debaryomyces hansenii was isolated. When subjected to salt stress the mutant produced glycerol, and the internal level of glycerol increased linearly in proportion to increases of external salinity as in the wild-type strain. However, at increased salinity the mutant showed a more pronounced decrease of growth rate and growth yield and lost more glycerol to the surrounding medium than did the wild type. Uptake experiments showed glycerol to be accumulated against a strong concentration gradient, and both strains displayed similar kinetic parameters for the uptake of glycerol. An examination of enzyme activities of the glycerol metabolism revealed that the apparent Km of the sn-glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.5) was increased 330-fold for sn-glycerol 3-phosphate in the mutant. Based on the findings, a scheme for the pathways of glycerol metabolism is suggested.

26717198|t|Hydrogel-Forming Microneedle Arrays Allow Detection of Drugs and Glucose In Vivo: Potential for Use in Diagnosis and Therapeutic Drug Monitoring.
26717198|a|We describe, for the first time the use of hydrogel-forming microneedle (MN) arrays for minimally-invasive extraction and quantification of drug substances and glucose from skin in vitro and in vivo. MN prepared from aqueous blends of hydrolysed poly(methyl-vinylether-co-maleic anhydride) (11.1% w/w) and poly(ethyleneglycol) 10,000 daltons (5.6% w/w) and crosslinked by esterification swelled upon skin insertion by uptake of fluid. Post-removal, theophylline and caffeine were extracted from MN and determined using HPLC, with glucose quantified using a proprietary kit. In vitro studies using excised neonatal porcine skin bathed on the underside by physiologically-relevant analyte concentrations showed rapid (5 min) analyte uptake. For example, mean concentrations of 0.16 μg/mL and 0.85 μg/mL, respectively, were detected for the lowest (5 μg/mL) and highest (35 μg/mL) Franz cell concentrations of theophylline after 5 min insertion. A mean concentration of 0.10 μg/mL was obtained by extraction of MN inserted for 5 min into skin bathed with 5 μg/mL caffeine, while the mean concentration obtained by extraction of MN inserted into skin bathed with 15 μg/mL caffeine was 0.33 μg/mL. The mean detected glucose concentration after 5 min insertion into skin bathed with 4 mmol/L was 19.46 nmol/L. The highest theophylline concentration detected following extraction from a hydrogel-forming MN inserted for 1 h into the skin of a rat dosed orally with 10 mg/kg was of 0.363 μg/mL, whilst a maximum concentration of 0.063 μg/mL was detected following extraction from a MN inserted for 1 h into the skin of a rat dosed with 5 mg/kg theophylline. In human volunteers, the highest mean concentration of caffeine detected using MN was 91.31 μg/mL over the period from 1 to 2 h post-consumption of 100 mg Proplus® tablets. The highest mean blood glucose level was 7.89 nmol/L detected 1 h following ingestion of 75 g of glucose, while the highest mean glucose concentration extracted from MN was 4.29 nmol/L, detected after 3 hours skin insertion in human volunteers. Whilst not directly correlated, concentrations extracted from MN were clearly indicative of trends in blood in both rats and human volunteers. This work strongly illustrates the potential of hydrogel-forming MN in minimally-invasive patient monitoring and diagnosis. Further studies are now ongoing to reduce clinical insertion times and develop mathematical algorithms enabling determination of blood levels directly from MN measurements.

15099582|t|Structural and mutational characterization of L-carnitine binding to human carnitine acetyltransferase.
15099582|a|We report the crystal structure of a binary complex of human peroxisomal carnitine acetyltransferase and the substrate l-carnitine, refined to a resolution of 1.8 Angstrom with an R(factor) value of 18.9% (R(free)=22.3%). L-carnitine binds to a preformed pocket in the active site tunnel of carnitine acetyltransferase aligned with His(322). The quaternary nitrogen of carnitine forms a pi-cation interaction with Phe(545), while Arg(497) forms an electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged carboxylate group. An extensive hydrogen bond network also occurs between the carboxylate group and Tyr(431), Thr(444), and a bound water molecule. Site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic characterization reveals that Tyr(431), Thr(444), Arg(497), and Phe(545) are essential for high affinity binding of L-carnitine.

11778363|t|[Familial hypophosphatemic rickets].
11778363|a|Familiar hypophosphatemic rickets (FHR) is characterized by isolated defect of renal phosphate reabsorption, hypophosphataemia, rickets and poor growth. In untreated cases parathyroid hormone and calcitriol levels are normal. FHR is caused by mutations of the PHEX gene encoding a zinc-binding metalloprotease enzyme. PHEX is expressed in bones and the parathyroid gland but not in the kidney. The gene product is involved in the inactivation of a phosphate regulating hormone (phosphatonin). The presence of this hormone through unknown mechanisms decreases the sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter in the kidney resulting in impaired phosphate transport. In addition the PHEX gene product exerts autocrine and paracrine effects on the bone. Despite recent advances in the understanding of the pathomechanism, treatment of FHR is still symptomatic. It consists of active vitamin D analogues and oral phosphate supplementation. Nephrocalcinosis is a well-known, usually non-progressive side effect of the conventional therapy. As shown by pilot studies, poorly growing children with FHR may benefit from the positive effect of human recombinant growth hormone (rhGH). However, rhGH treatment could aggravate the already existing tendency to disproportionate growth resulting in the overgrowth of the trunk. The disturbed phosphate homeostasis persists during the whole life span of the FHR patients. It is therefore essential to provide lifelong care, to prevent late skeletal and dental consequences or to treat them if already established. That care should be done by the teamwork of the pediatrician, internist, orthopedist, dentist and the psychologist.

10502298|t|Nitric oxide prevents apoptosis of human endothelial cells from high glucose exposure during early stage.
10502298|a|Hyperglycemia is a major cause of diabetic vascular disease. High glucose can induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) generation, which can subsequently induce endothelial dysfunction. High glucose is also capable of triggering endothelial cell apoptosis. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms and the role of ROS and NO in high glucose-induced endothelial cell apoptosis. This study was designed to determine the involvement of ROS and NO in high glucose-induced endothelial cell apoptosis. Expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein and apoptosis were studied in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) exposed to control-level (5.5 mM) and high-level (33 mM) glucose at various periods (e.g., 2, 12, 24, 48 h). We also examined the effect of high glucose on H(2)O(2) production using flow cytometry. The results showed that eNOS protein expression was up-regulated by high glucose exposure for 2-6 h and gradually reduced after longer exposure in HUVECs. H(2)O(2) production and apoptosis, which can be reversed by vitamin C and NO donor (sodium nitroprusside), but enhanced by NOS inhibitor (N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ether), were collated to a different time course (24-48 h) to HUVECs. These results provide the molecular basis for understanding that NO plays a protective role from apoptosis of HUVECs during the early stage (<24 h) of high glucose exposure, but in the late stage (>24 h), high glucose exposure leads to the imbalance of NO and ROS, resulting to the observed apoptosis. This may explain, at least in part, the impaired endothelial function and vascular complication of diabetic mellitus that would occur at late stages.

26172854|t|Identification of a Novel Regulatory Mechanism of Nutrient Transport Controlled by TORC1-Npr1-Amu1/Par32.
26172854|a|Fine-tuning the plasma-membrane permeability to essential nutrients is fundamental to cell growth optimization. Nutritional signals including nitrogen availability are integrated by the TORC1 complex which notably regulates arrestin-mediated endocytosis of amino-acid transporters. Ammonium is a ubiquitous compound playing key physiological roles in many, if not all, organisms. In yeast, it is a preferred nitrogen source transported by three Mep proteins which are orthologues of the mammalian Rhesus factors. By combining genetic, kinetic, biochemical and cell microscopy analyses, the current study reveals a novel mechanism enabling TORC1 to regulate the inherent activity of ammonium transport proteins, independently of arrestin-mediated endocytosis, identifying the still functional orphan Amu1/Par32 as a selective regulator intermediate. We show that, under poor nitrogen supply, the TORC1 effector kinase' Npr1' promotes phosphorylation of Amu1/Par32 which appears mainly cytosolic while ammonium transport proteins are active. Upon preferred nitrogen supplementation, like glutamine or ammonium addition, TORC1 upregulation enables Npr1 inhibition and Amu1/Par32 dephosphorylation. In these conditions, as in Npr1-lacking cells, hypophosphorylated Amu1/Par32 accumulates at the cell surface and mediates the inhibition of specific ammonium transport proteins. We show that the integrity of a conserved repeated motif of Amu1/Par32 is required for the interaction with these transport proteins. This study underscores the diversity of strategies enabling TORC1-Npr1 to selectively monitor cell permeability to nutrients by discriminating between transporters to be degraded or transiently inactivated and kept stable at the plasma membrane. This study further identifies the function of Amu1/Par32 in acute control of ammonium transport in response to variations in nitrogen availability.

11827277|t|Evaluation of toxicity of pesticides and their biodegradation products using human cells.
11827277|a|Juvenoids are biologically active compounds, of relatively low toxicity to humans, that efficiently inhibit the fertility of insects. However, little attention has been paid to the stability and toxicity of products that may be generated by their biodegradation in the ecosystem. This study describes a simple comparison of the toxicity of the active compound and its degradation products generated by aerobic soil microbial isolates. Surprisingly we have found that toxicity of a biologically active carbamate juvenoid N-[2-[4-(2,2-ethylenedioxy-1-cyclohexylmethyl)-phenoxylethyl]carbamate (W328) was comparable with that of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT). The toxic effect was evaluated using the determination of the ATP/ADP content and viability of HeLa S3 cells exposed to various concentrations of the chemicals tested for various durations. DDT was used as a reference compound. Its toxicity was compared with two juvenile hormone analogs. The original compound, W328, was found to be the most toxic. The major product (W329) generated both by yeast isolates and the mixture of moulds lost its activity on reproduction of the tested insect. Its toxicity towards human cells was also decreased. Another two W328 degradation HPLC fractions exhibited significantly reduced toxicity compared to W328.

8161785|t|Involvement of the sphingomyelin pathway in autocrine tumor necrosis factor signaling for human immunodeficiency virus production in chronically infected HL-60 cells.
8161785|a|Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a potent inducer of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) proviral transcription and subsequent mature virus production. Recent investigations have shown that TNF can use a signal transduction pathway in HL-60 cells involving sphingomyelin hydrolysis to ceramide with subsequent stimulation of a ceramide-linked kinase. When sphingomyelinase was added exogenously to activate this cascade in HIV-1-infected HL-60 cells, it mimicked TNF-induced HIV production. Phospholipases A2, C, or D, which do not generate ceramide, had no effect; however, a synthetic ceramide analog added exogenously potently induced HIV production. In addition, anti-TNF antibodies blocked much of the effect of both sphingomyelinase and the synthetic ceramide analog on virus expression, suggesting that, although signaling is initiated through the sphingomyelin pathway, it is sustained by autocrine TNF synthesis. Thus, direct activation of the sphingomyelin pathway recapitulated the effect of TNF on both HIV and TNF production. These studies indicate that the sphingomyelin pathway is involved in TNF signaling for HIV production in chronically infected myeloid cells.

25593649|t|Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Water Chestnut Extract on Cytokine Responses via Nuclear Factor-κB-signaling Pathway.
25593649|a|Water chestnut (Trapa japonica Flerov.) is an annual aquatic plant. In the present study, we showed that the treatment of water chestnut extracted with boiling water resulted in a significant increase 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging activity and decrease the intracellular H2O2-induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species. In addition, water chestnut extract (WCE) inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide production and suppressed mRNA and protein expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase gene. The cytokine array results showed that WCE inhibited inflammatory cytokine secretion. Also, WCE reduced tumor necrosis factor-α-and interleukin-6-induced nuclear factor-αB activity. Furthermore, during sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS)-induced irritation of human skin, WCE reduced SLS-induced skin erythema and improved barrier regeneration. These results indicate that WCE may be a promising topical anti-inflammatory agent.

10746865|t|Potassium increases intracellular calcium simulating progesterone action in human sperm.
10746865|a|Progesterone (P) and zona pellucida are known to induce acrosome reaction in human sperm by increasing cytosolic calcium. High concentrations of potassium ions (K+) improve the rate of acrosome reaction in human sperm in vitro. This article determined whether the effect of K+ on the acrosome in human sperm is mediated by increasing intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i). The effect of K+ on [Ca2+]i was examined by using Fura 2 as the fluorescent indicator. The effect of K+ and P on [Ca2+]i in sperm and the involvement of ion channels was compared. Motile sperm were collected by the swim-up method from semen of healthy volunteers and capacitated overnight in BWW containing 0.5% BSA. Incubation of capacitated sperm with different concentrations of potassium chloride (1.25-20 mM) resulted in dose-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i similar to that observed with P. The increase in [Ca2+]i by K+ and P was blocked by the addition of EGTA, a Ca2+ chelator. K+-induced change in [Ca2+] was not altered by the addition of dihydropyridine derivatives. The combined treatment of K+ (20 mM) and P (0.75 microg/mL) caused an additive effect on the increase in [Ca2+]i. It would appear that human sperm plasma membrane possess different Ca2+ channels responsive to P and K+.

23608466|t|Mitochondrial superoxide mediates mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum dysfunctions in TRAIL-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells.
23608466|a|Reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide (O2(•-)) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), have been reported to be important mediators of the apoptosis induced by death ligands, including Fas, tumor necrosis factor-α, and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Conversely, there is evidence that H2O2 and prooxidative conditions are protective. Therefore, the roles of ROS in death ligand-induced apoptosis are a matter of debate. In this study, we attempted to define the oxidant species mediating TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human tumor cells. The generation of intracellular O2(•-), but not H2O2, was correlated with apoptosis in the cells. TRAIL treatment resulted in increased mitochondrial O2(•-) generation and the oxidation of cardiolipin. The O2(•-)-selective scavenger MnTBaP [Mn(III) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin chloride] specifically blocked TRAIL-induced apoptosis and proapoptotic events including mitochondrial membrane collapse and caspase-3/7 activation. TRAIL also induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses including caspase-12 activation, while inhibition of caspase-12 prevented the apoptosis. In addition, increased mitochondrial O2(•-) generation by uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation or inhibition of the electron transport chain amplified the TRAIL-induced apoptosis and proapoptotic events. This amplification was also significantly abolished by MnTBaP treatment. Our data indicate that mitochondrial O2(•-) mediates mitochondrial and ER dysfunctions during TRAIL-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells. The present findings suggest that pharmacological agents increasing mitochondrial O2(•-) may serve as clinical drugs that amplify TRAIL effectiveness toward cancer cells.

2536615|t|Presumptive neurons derived by differentiation of a human embryonal carcinoma cell line exhibit tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium currents and the capacity for regenerative responses.
2536615|a|Cloned human embryonal carcinoma cells (NTERA-2 cl.D1) differentiate into neuron-like cells upon exposure to retinoic acid. Using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques, these putative neurons exhibited rapidly activating and inactivating inward currents upon depolarization as well as outward currents. The electrical characteristics and tetrodotoxin (TTX) sensitivity of the inward currents suggest that they were sodium currents. By contrast, only outward potassium currents were seen in the undifferentiated stem cells. Under current clamp conditions, the neuron-like cells showed regenerative responses. The peaks of these responses never exceeded the O-mV level, perhaps due to the low mean inward current density of 93.8 +/- 17.8 (SEM) microA/cm2:n = 9. The electrophysiological characteristics of these human teratocarcinoma-derived neuron-like cells were consistent with our previous identification of these cells as neurons, but suggest that they may resemble immature embryonic, rather than adult, neurons.

3795047|t|Elimination of chronically consumed caffeine in the pregnant monkey (Macaca fascicularis).
3795047|a|Characterization of alterations in caffeine elimination during pregnancy is essential in assessing the potential exposure of the fetus to caffeine and its metabolites. Female monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were exposed to caffeine in their drinking water 7 days/week before, during and after pregnancy. The low exposure (0.15 mg/ml) corresponded to a level sometimes consumed by pregnant women (10-15 mg/kg/day) whereas the high exposure (0.35 mg/ml) was above average human consumption (25-30 mg/kg/day). Blood samples and 24-hr urine samples were collected every 2 weeks throughout dosing. Caffeine and metabolite concentrations in serum and urine were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Before pregnancy, geometric mean serum caffeine concentrations were approximately 1.6 and 4.9 micrograms/ml and serum theophylline concentrations were 6.6 and 13.3 micrograms/ml for the low and high dose groups, respectively. During pregnancy, serum caffeine concentrations increased by approximately 100% for both dose groups and, after parturition, declined to prepregnancy concentrations. Serum theophylline concentrations were usually greater than serum caffeine concentrations and did not change during pregnancy. The amount of caffeine and theophylline excreted in the urine over 24 hr increased during pregnancy and returned to prepregnancy levels after parturition. The results of this study indicate that pregnancy decreased caffeine elimination, resulting in a significant increase in serum caffeine levels. The changes in caffeine elimination may be related to alterations in serum estrogen and progesterone levels.

14503720|t|Effect of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide on Cryptosporidium parvum viability in fruit juices.
14503720|a|Cryptosporidium parvum has historically been associated with waterborne outbreaks of diarrheal illness. Foodborne cryptosporidiosis has been associated with unpasteurized apple cider. Infectious oocysts are shed in the feces of common ruminants like cattle and deer in and near orchards. In this study, the ability of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) added to fruit juice to inhibit the survival of C. parvum was analyzed. Oocyst viability was analyzed by a cell culture infectivity assay with the use of a human ileocecal cell line (HCT-8) whose infectivity pattern is similar to that for human oral infectivity. Cell monolayers were infected with 10(6) treated oocysts or a series of 10-fold dilutions. Parasitic life stages were visualized through immunohistochemistry with 100 microscope fields per monolayer being counted. In vitro excystation assays were also used to evaluate these treatments. Organic acids and H2O2 were added to apple cider, orange juice, and grape juices on a weight/volume basis. Malic, citric, and tartaric acids at concentrations of 1 to 5% inhibited C. parvum's infectivity of HCT-8 cells by up to 88%. Concentrations ranging from 0.025 to 3% H2O2 were evaluated. The addition of 0.025% H2O2 to each juice resulted in a >5-log reduction of C. parvum infectivity as determined with a most-probable-number-based cell culture infectivity assay. As observed with differential interference contrast and scanning electron microscopy, reduced infectivity may be mediated through effects on the oocyst wall that are caused by the action of H2O2 or related oxygen radicals. The addition of low concentrations of H2O2 can represent a valuable alternative to pasteurization.

1352432|t|Anoxia/reoxygenation-induced neutrophil adherence to cultured endothelial cells.
1352432|a|Previous studies have shown enhanced neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells exposed to anoxia and then reoxygenated (A/R). To define the molecular basis for these observations, we evaluated the relative roles of CD11/CD18 determinants (CD11a and CD11b) of neurtrophils and the endothelial adhesion proteins intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 (ELAM-1). Human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) monolayers were exposed to anoxia for 30 min, reoxygenated, and then reacted with 51Cr-labeled neutrophils in adhesion assays. Neutrophil adhesion to HUVEC exposed to A/R was significantly increased (2.7-fold) as compared with that observed with normoxic (control) HUVEC. This A/R-induced hyperadherence was significantly diminished by monoclonal antibodies (MAb) directed at CD11a, CD11b, CD18 or ICAM-1, but not by MAb directed at ELAM-1. The inhibitory effects of anti-CD11a and anti-CD11b were additive and equivalent to that of anti-CD18 MAb. A/R did not elicit increased levels of ICAM-1 or ELAM-1 mRNA or surface protein. However, immunofluorescence flow cytometry indicated that incubation of neutrophils in supernatants of A/R-conditioned HUVEC elicited an increase of surface CD11b and CD18, but not CD11a. Supernatants from A/R-conditioned HUVEC promoted neutrophil adherence to naive HUVEC, and this hyperadhesivity was diminished by a platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor antagonist and catalase but not by a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, a leukotriene B4 receptor antagonist, or superoxide dismutase. These studies indicate that A/R promotes neutrophil adherence via CD11a/CD18- and CD11b/CD18-dependent interactions with ICAM-1 that appear to be mediated by hydrogen peroxide and PAF.

22368233|t|Strong antiviral activity of the new l-hydroxycytidine derivative, l-Hyd4FC, in HBV-infected human chimeric uPA/SCID mice.
22368233|a|BACKGROUND: Suppression of viral replication with nucleoside/nucleotide inhibitors has been shown to greatly improve the outcome of chronic HBV infection. β-l-nucleoside analogues, especially β-l-deoxycytidine derivatives represent one of the most efficient groups of antiretroviral compounds. We recently described that hydroxylation of the amino group of these β-l-deoxycytidine derivatives preserved their strong HBV inhibitory activity in vitro, but strongly reduced their cytotoxicity. From this new group of compounds we selected β-l-2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxy-N(4)-hydroxy-5-fluorocytidine (l-Hyd4FC) for a first in vivo investigation. The aim of this study was to determine the antiviral activity of l-Hyd4FC in HBV-infected human liver chimeric urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)/SCID mice. METHODS: Stably infected animals (median 6×10(7) HBV DNA/ml) were injected daily with either l-Hyd4FC (50 mg/kg) or saline as controls. Mice treated with lamivudine served to compare the in vivo antiviral potency of l-Hyd4FC. Virological changes were determined by quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Treatment with l-Hyd4FC for 4 weeks induced a 2-log reduction of viraemia, while a median 1.5-log decline was achieved with lamivudine. Intrahepatically, l-Hyd4FC induced a median eightfold decline of viral activity (relaxed circular DNA/covalently closed circular DNA), and threefold reduction of pregenomic RNA/GAPDH levels. No significant decline of subgenomic HBV transcripts, as well as of circulating hepatitis B e antigen and hepatitis B surface antigen was detected. Maintenance of human serum albumin concentrations throughout the study, negative TUNEL staining and occurrence of viral rebound after drug withdrawal indicated that l-Hyd4FC was not toxic in human hepatocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of l-Hyd4FC in uPA/SCID mice harbouring HBV-infected human hepatocytes demonstrated the high antiviral potency of this drug in vivo. Such characteristics make l-Hyd4FC a good candidate for further investigations a as potential HBV therapeutic agent.

21966580|t|The role of M(3)-muscarinic receptor signaling in insulin secretion.
21966580|a|Recently, M(3)-muscarinic receptor (M3R) has been identified as the bona fide receptor responsible for the cholinergic regulation of glucose-induced insulin release. The molecular mechanisms of such regulation have also begun to be unravelled. These include the conventional G protein-dependent pathways involving calcium mobilization and activation of protein kinase C. In addition, recent studies also provided evidence for G protein-independent pathways in the regulation of insulin secretion by M3R. These include phosphorylation/arrestin-dependent activation of protein kinase D1, Src family kinase-dependent activation of the sodium channel NALCN and the involvement of regulator of G protein signaling (RGS)-4. Time has now come to extend these studies which were done mainly in rodents to human and explore the potential for targeting such pathways at different levels for the treatment of diseases with impaired insulin secretion such as type II diabetes.

2528702|t|Differences in the temperature dependence of drug interaction with the noradrenaline and serotonin transporters.
2528702|a|High affinity, sodium-dependent binding of [3H]mazindol is associated with the noradrenergic transporter while the binding of [3H]imipramine and [3H]paroxetine are associated with the serotonin transporter, e.g. in human platelets. In general radioligand binding studies to the monoamine transporters are performed at a temperature different from the physiological temperature (37 degrees C) at which uptake occurs. Previously reported data show a temperature dependence for tricyclic but not for nontricyclic inhibitors of the uptake of serotonin in their interaction with radioligand binding to the serotonin transporter. In the present study, both tricyclic and nontricyclic inhibitors of the uptake of noradrenaline were shown to have equal affinity for the binding of [3H]mazindol to the noradrenergic transporter at 0 degrees and 25 degrees C. Moreover, whereas serotonin transporter substrates inhibit the binding of [3H]imipramine/paroxetine in human platelets in an essentially temperature-independent manner (0-37 degrees C), noradrenaline transporter substrates are of higher affinity in inhibiting the binding of [3H]mazindol at 0 degrees C than at 25 degrees C. At 0 degrees C, substrate affinity for inhibition of the binding of [3H]mazindol to the noradrenaline transporter in the salivary gland of the rat approximates to the substrate affinity for transport by the noradrenaline carrier. The present data point to significant differences in the interaction of both substrates and inhibitors with the noradrenergic and serotonergic transporters, as studied using the radioligand binding. Thus, the pharmacological profile of the serotonin transporter, in terms of substrate and inhibitor affinity, is best studied using radioligand binding at 37 degrees C, whereas radioligand binding to the noradrenaline transporter is most representative at 0 degrees C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

8750923|t|The inhibitory modulation of guinea-pig intestinal peristalsis caused by capsaicin involves calcitonin gene-related peptide and nitric oxide.
8750923|a|The effect of capsaicin-induced stimulation of afferent neurons on peristalsis and the possible neural mediators involved in this action were examined in the guinea-pig isolated ileum. The intraluminal pressure threshold for eliciting peristaltic waves was used to quantify facilitation (decrease in threshold) or inhibition (increase in threshold) of peristalsis. Capsaicin (0.1-1 microM) caused an initial short-lasting stimulation of peristalsis followed by a prolonged inhibition of peristaltic activity. Capsaicin (1 microM) was ineffective when the gut segments had been pretreated with 3.3 microM capsaicin, which is indicative of an afferent neuron-dependent action of the drug. In contrast, the abolition of peristalsis caused by a high concentration of capsaicin (33 microM) was fully reversible on removal and reproducible on readministration of capsaicin, a feature characteristic of a nonspecific depression of smooth muscle excitability. Baseline peristalsis and the excitatory/inhibitory effect of capsaicin (1 microM) on peristalsis remained unaltered by a combination of the tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist (+)-(2S, 3S)-3-(2-methoxybenzylamino)-2-phenyl piperidine (CP-99,994; 0.3 microM) and the tachykinin NK2 receptor antagonist (L(-)-N-methyl-N[4-acetylamino-4-phenyl-piperidine-2-(3,4- -dichlorophenyl)butyl]-benzamide (SR-48,968; 0.1 microM). Further experiments, performed in the presence of a low concentration of atropine (10 nM) showed that the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist human alpha-calcitonin gene-related peptide (8-37) [hCGRP(8-37); 10 microM] attenuated the delayed inhibitory effect of capsaicin on peristalsis, but did not influence baseline peristaltic activity and the capsaicin-induced facilitation of peristalsis. Blockade of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis by NG-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME, 300 microM) facilitated baseline peristaltic activity and reduced the delayed inhibition of peristalsis caused by capsaicin (1 microM) without affecting the initial peristalsis-stimulating action of capsaicin. The effects of L-NAME were prevented by L-arginine (1 mM). The data of the current study indicate that capsaicin-sensitive afferent neurons do not participate in the neural pathways subserving peristalsis in the guinea-pig small intestine, but modulate peristaltic activity upon stimulation with capsaicin. The initial stimulant action of capsaicin on peristalsis is independent of tachykinins acting via NK1 or NK2 receptors, while the delayed capsaicin-induced depression of peristalsis involves CGRP and NO.

11057758|t|Effects of hypoxia on cholesterol metabolism in human monocyte-derived macrophages.
11057758|a|We assessed the metabolism of low density lipoprotein (LDL) of human monocyte-derived macrophages under hypoxia. The specific binding and association of 125I-labeled LDL (125I-LDL) were not changed under hypoxia compared to normoxia. However, the degradation of 125I-LDL under hypoxia decreased to 60%. The rate of cholesterol esterification under hypoxia was 2-fold greater on incubation with LDL or 25-hydroxycholesterol. The cellular cholesteryl ester content was also greater under hypoxia on incubation with LDL. Secretion of apolipoprotein E into the medium was not altered under hypoxia, suggesting that apolipoprotein E independent cholesterol efflux may be reduced under hypoxia. Thus, hypoxia affects the intracellular metabolism of LDL, stimulates cholesterol esterification, and enhances cholesteryl ester accumulation in macrophages. Hypoxia is one of the important factors modifying the cellular lipid metabolism in arterial wall.

19830557|t|Methane and the gastrointestinal tract.
19830557|a|INTRODUCTION: Several gases are produced through enteric fermentation in the intestinal tract. Carbon dioxide, hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide, and methane are thought to be the most common of these. Recent evidence suggests that methane may not be inert. In this review article, we summarize the findings with methane. METHODS: This is a review article discussing the various component gases in the gastrointestinal tract and their relevance to health and disease. Specific attention was paid to understanding methane. RESULTS: The majority of these gases are eliminated via flatus or absorbed into systemic circulation and expelled from the lungs. Excessive gas evacuation or retention causes gastrointestinal functional symptoms such as belching, flatulence, bloating, and pain. Between 30 and 62% of healthy subjects produce methane. Methane is produced exclusively through anaerobic fermentation of both endogenous and exogenous carbohydrates by enteric microflora in humans. Methane is not utilized by humans, and analysis of respiratory methane can serve as an indirect measure of methane production. Recent literature suggests that gases such as hydrogen sulfide and methane may have active effects on gut function. In the case of hydrogen sulfide, evidence demonstrates that this gaseous product may be produced by human eukaryotic cells. However, in the case of methane, there is increasing evidence that this gas has both physical and biological effects on gut function. It is now often associated with functional constipation and may have an active role here. CONCLUSION: This review of the literature discusses the significance of enteric flora, the biogenesis of methane, and its clinical associations. Furthermore, we examine the evidence for an active role of methane in gastrointestinal motility and the potential applications to future therapeutics.

8931454|t|Inhibition of muscarinic receptor-stimulated glial cell proliferation by ethanol.
8931454|a|Acetylcholine and other muscarinic agonists stimulate the proliferation of rat cortical astrocytes and 132 1N1 human astrocytoma cells by activating muscarinic m3 cholinergic receptors. Ethanol was a potent inhibitor of carbachol-stimulated proliferation, measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation, with an IC50 of 10 mM. On the other hand, basal and serum-stimulated proliferation of astrocytes and astrocytoma cells was inhibited by ethanol with lower potency (IC50 = 200-250 mM). Concentration-response experiments with carbachol, in the presence of 10 mM ethanol, suggested that inhibition of proliferation by the alcohol was of the noncompetitive type. Experiments with acetaldehyde and with the alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor 4-methylpyrazole suggested that the inhibitory effect of alcohol was due to ethanol itself and not to its metabolite acetaldehyde. Proliferation of astrocytoma cells induced by carbachol and the inhibitory effects of ethanol were also confirmed by flow cytometry using the 5-bromodeoxyuridine-Hoechst 33258 method. Ethanol (10 mM) had no effect on proliferation induced by 50 micrograms/ml insulin and 100 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor BB; on the other hand, the mitogenic effect of 1 mM histamine, 100 U/ml interleukin-1, and 100 ng/ml 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate were inhibited by approximately 50%. These results indicate that proliferation of glial cells induced by muscarinic agonists is especially sensitive to the inhibitory effect of ethanol. This action of ethanol may be relevant to its developmental neurotoxicity, particularly microencephaly, which is one of the common features of the fetal alcohol syndrome.

9952450|t|Apyrase functions in plant phosphate nutrition and mobilizes phosphate from extracellular ATP.
9952450|a|ATP, which is present in the extracellular matrix of multicellular organisms and in the extracellular fluid of unicellular organisms, has been shown to function as a signaling molecule in animals. The concentration of extracellular ATP (xATP) is known to be functionally modulated in part by ectoapyrases, membrane-associated proteins that cleave the gamma- and beta-phosphates on xATP. We present data showing a previously unreported (to our knowledge) linkage between apyrase and phosphate transport. An apyrase from pea (Pisum sativum) complements a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) phosphate-transport mutant and significantly increases the amount of phosphate taken up by transgenic plants overexpressing the gene. The transgenic plants show enhanced growth and augmented phosphate transport when the additional phosphate is supplied as inorganic phosphate or as ATP. When scavenging phosphate from xATP, apyrase mobilizes the gamma-phosphate without promoting the transport of the purine or the ribose.

11426712|t|Human cerebral cysticercosis: immunolocalization of a sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter (SGLT) in larval and adult tapeworms.
11426712|a|Light microscopic immunocytochemistry was used to examine human brain cysticerci resected from the fourth ventricles of patients who had not been treated with anthelminthic drugs. Tissues were examined from 3 different patients undergoing surgery for treatment of hydrocephalus. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum to the peptide corresponding to amino acids 564-575 unique to the rabbit sodium-dependent, SGLT1 glucose cotransporter labeled with immunoperoxidase, localized immunoreactive SGLT epitopes. This antibody localizes SGLT1 in the apical brush borders of human enterocytes, but is negative in cytoplasm, as well as lateral and basal enterocyte membranes. Taenia solium neurocysticerci were SGLT positive; transporter protein was highly expressed on the surface microvilli of the external cyst wall. The well-developed network of small and larger osmoregulatory ducts within racemose larval cystcerci displayed high expression of SGLT cotransporter, consistent with a resorptive function for this system of tubules. Because water is cotransported with glucose molecules by the SGLT protein, its high expression in neurocysticerci may contribute to the expansive growth of these larvae in subarachnoid and intraventricular sites. The SGLT epitopes were also immunolocalized in gravid proglottids of Taenia saginata, indicating that cotransporter expression persisted in intestinal-dwelling, adult tapeworms. Cotransporter antibody was abundantly localized at the proglottid tegumentary surface and in the lateral osmoregulatory ducts, analogous to the SGLT localization in cysticerci. Furthermore, high expression of this cotransporter was seen in the branches of the uterus, suggesting that SGLT-mediated absorption of glucose and water has an important functional role within the reproductive system of adult tapeworms.

15812013|t|Nutrient effects on biocontrol of Penicillium roqueforti by Pichia anomala J121 during airtight storage of wheat.
15812013|a|The biocontrol yeast Pichia anomala inhibits the growth of a variety of mold species. We examined the mechanism underlying the inhibition of the grain spoilage mold Penicillium roqueforti by the biocontrol yeast P. anomala J121 during airtight storage. The biocontrol effect in a model grain silo with moist wheat (water activity of 0.96) was enhanced when complex medium, maltose, or glucose was added. Supplementation with additional nitrogen or vitamin sources did not affect the biocontrol activity of the yeast. The addition of complex medium or glucose did not significantly influence the yeast cell numbers in the silos, whether in the presence or absence of P. roqueforti. Mold growth was not influenced by the addition of nutrients, if cultivated without yeast. The products of glucose metabolism, mainly ethanol and ethyl acetate, increased after glucose addition to P. anomala-inoculated treatments. Our results suggest that neither competition for nutrients nor production of a glucose-repressible cell wall lytic enzyme is the main mode of action of biocontrol by P. anomala in this grain system. Instead, the mold-inhibiting effect probably is due to the antifungal action of metabolites, most likely a combination of ethyl acetate and ethanol, derived from glycolysis. The discovery that sugar amendments enhance the biocontrol effect of P. anomala suggests novel ways of formulating biocontrol yeasts.

17582235|a|This work describes a sensitive method for the simultaneous determination of 17 antiretroviral drugs including nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors and a nucleotide analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor in 50 microL of human plasma. This method employed high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization. The analytes were monitored in multiple reaction monitoring mode and the polarity was switched from positive to negative to positive to detect all compounds after a single injection. A combination of liquid-liquid extraction and protein precipitation was used to extract all compounds, with at least 75% recovery for all analytes. Within- and between-day accuracies were at least 85% for 1-500 ng/mL for nelfinavir, indinavir and abacavir, 10-500 ng/mL for didanosine and stavudine and 5-500 ng/mL for all other compounds. This method is very effective for quantifying and screening antiretroviral drugs in clinical samples with limited (50 microL) volumes.

3693368|t|Acetaldehyde increases collagen gene transcription in cultured human fibroblasts.
3693368|a|Acetaldehyde, the first metabolite of ethanol, mediates many of the biological effects of ethanol. We have previously shown that acetaldehyde, but not ethanol, stimulates collagen production in cultured human fibroblasts (Holt, K., Bennett, M., and Chojkier, M. (1984) Hepatology 4, 843-848). Here, we examined the effects of acetaldehyde on collagen gene expression. Confluent human fetal fibroblasts were incubated for up to 4 h in the presence of ascorbate (0.2 mM) alone or with the addition of either ethanol (12 mM) or acetaldehyde (200 microM). Acetaldehyde induced the production of collagen (up to 2.5-fold) and had a small inhibitory effect on procollagen secretion (-20%). The steady-state levels of mRNAs were measured by hybridizing total cellular RNA to specific cDNA probes at high stringency. Acetaldehyde increased the steady-state level of collagen alpha 1(I) and collagen alpha 2(I) mRNAs about 3-fold and had small effects on beta-actin mRNA (+50%) and collagenase mRNA (-50%). Northern blots revealed that the RNAs were intact and that acetaldehyde preferentially increased the abundance of the longer of the two collagen alpha 1(I) transcripts. Acetaldehyde increased both collagen alpha 1(I) and collagen alpha 1(III) transcriptional activity by 2.5-fold and had small effects on beta-actin and collagenase gene transcription. The increase in both collagen production and collagen mRNA levels induced by acetaldehyde was blocked by methylene blue, a scavenger of reducing equivalents. These data indicate that reducing equivalents, which enhance the formation and stability of acetaldehyde-protein adducts, may be required for acetaldehyde-stimulated collagen production. Thus, this study suggests that acetaldehyde increases collagen production by increasing collagen gene transcription in cultured human fibroblasts.

9350059|t|Glucose-induced positive cooperativity of fructose phosphorylation by human B-cell glucokinase.
9350059|a|Human B-cell glucokinase displays sigmoidal kinetics towards D-glucose or D-mannose, but fails to do so towards D-fructose. Yet, D-glucose, D-mannose and 2-deoxy-D-glucose confer to the enzyme positive cooperativity towards D-fructose. For instance, in the presence of 5 mM D-[U-14C]fructose, its rate of phosphorylation is increased to 214.3 +/- 11.0%, 134.0 +/- 4.3% and 116.5 +/- 3.0% of paired control value by D-glucose, D-mannose and 2-deoxy-D-glucose (each 6 mM), respectively. D-glucose and, to a lesser extent, D-mannose also display reciprocal kinetic cooperativity. D-fructose, however, fails to affect D-glucose or D-mannose phosphorylation under conditions in which positive cooperativity is otherwise observed. These findings are relevant to the reciprocal effects of distinct hexoses upon their phosphorylation by B-cell glucokinase and, as such, to the metabolic and functional response evoked in pancreatic islet B-cells by these sugars, when tested either separately or in combination.

6434317|t|Effects of ethanol and acetaldehyde on cultured rabbit aortic myocytes and human platelets in vitro.
6434317|a|The recently reported finding that a moderate alcohol consumption may lower the risk of cardiovascular disease prompted a study of the effects of ethanol and acetaldehyde on proliferation, viability and collagen secretion of rabbit aortic myocytes in culture and on the spontaneous efflux reaction of human platelets in vitro. Ethanol had no effects on any of the systems and acetaldehyde did not influence platelets significantly. Fifty mumol 1(-1) acetaldehyde diminished the proliferation and collagen secretion of arterial myocytes by 20% (P less than 0.01) and 100 mumol 1(-1) acetaldehyde by 39% (P less than 0.001) without affecting cell mass or cell death. A metabolic degradation, and some evaporation, of acetaldehyde was taking place and 50 mumol 1(-1) acetaldehyde was halved after approximately 2 h. The more 'physiological' concentration of acetaldehyde (5 mumol 1(-1] influenced cell proliferation significantly (P less than 0.001) if the concentration was restored by 6-h intervals and the incubation time increased from 24 to 48 h. The weak aldehydedehydrogenase inhibitor chlorpropamide did not accentuate the effects of acetaldehyde.

25472447|t|A new family of choline kinase inhibitors with antiproliferative and antitumor activity derived from natural products.
25472447|a|BACKGROUND: Choline kinase alpha (ChoKα) is a critical enzyme in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, a major structural component of eukaryotic cell membranes. ChoKα is overexpressed in a large variety of tumor cells and has been proposed as a target for personalized medicine, both in cancer therapy and rheumatoid arthritis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Triterpene quinone methides (TPQ) bioactive compounds isolated from plants of the Celastraceae family and a set of their semisynthetic derivatives were tested against the recombinant human ChoKα. Those found active as potent enzymatic inhibitors were tested in vitro for antiproliferative activity against HT29 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells, and one of the active compounds was tested for in vivo antitumoral activity in mice xenographs of HT29 cells. RESULTS: Among 59 natural and semisynthetic TPQs tested in an ex vivo system, 14 were highly active as inhibitors of the enzyme ChoKα with IC50 <10 μM. Nine of these were potent antiproliferative agents (IC50 <10 μM) against tumor cells. At least one compound was identified as a new antitumoral drug based on its in vivo activity against xenographs of human HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma cells. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of a new family of natural and semisynthetic compounds with potent inhibitory activity against ChoKα and both in vitro antiproliferative and in vivo antitumoral activity supports further research on these inhibitors as potential anticancer agents. Their likely role as antiproliferative drugs deserves further studies in models of rheumatoid arthritis.

25499751|t|Production and application of a rare disaccharide using sucrose phosphorylase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides.
25499751|a|Sucrose phosphorylase (SPase) from Leuconostoc mesenteroides exhibited activity towards eight ketohexoses, which behaved as D-glucosyl acceptors, and α-D-glucose-1-phosphate (G1P), which behaved as a donor. All eight of these ketohexoses were subsequently transformed into the corresponding d-glucosyl-ketohexoses. Of the eight ketohexoses evaluated in the current study, d-allulose behaved as the best substrate for SPase, and the resulting d-glucosyl-d-alluloside product was found to be a non-reducing sugar with a specific optical rotation of [α]D(20) + 74.36°. D-Glucosyl-D-alluloside was identified as α-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→2)-β-D-allulofuranoside by NMR analysis. D-Glucosyl-D-alluloside exhibited an inhibitory activity towards an invertase from yeast with a Km value of 50 mM, where it behaved as a competitive inhibitor with a Ki value of 9.2 mM. D-Glucosyl-D-alluloside was also successfully produced from sucrose using SPase and D-tagatose 3-epimerase. This process also allowed for the production of G1P from sucrose and d-allulose from D-fructose, which suggested that this method could be used to prepare d-glucosyl-d-alluloside without the need for expensive reagents such as G1P and d-allulose.

15178698|t|Electrophysiological, pharmacological, and molecular evidence for alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in rat midbrain dopamine neurons.
15178698|a|Dopamine (DA) neurons located in the mammalian midbrain have been generally implicated in reward and drug reinforcement and more specifically in nicotine dependence. However, roles played by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, including those composed of alpha7-subunits [alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs)], in modulation of DA signaling and in nicotine dependence are not clearly understood. Although midbrain slice recording has been used previously to identify functional alpha7-nAChRs, these preparations are not optimally designed for extremely rapid and reproducible drug application, and rapidly desensitized, alpha7-nAChR-mediated currents may have been underestimated or not detected. Here, we use patch-clamp, whole-cell current recordings from single neurons acutely dissociated from midbrain nuclei and having features of DA neurons to characterize acetylcholine-induced, inward currents that rapidly activate and desensitize, are mimicked by the alpha7-nAChR-selective agonist, choline, blocked by the alpha7-nAChR-selective antagonists, methyllycaconitine and alpha-bungarotoxin, and are similar to those of heterologously expressed, human alpha7-nAChRs. We also use reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization, and immunocytochemical staining to demonstrate nAChR alpha7 subunit gene expression as message and protein in the rat substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area. Expression of alpha7 subunit message and of alpha7-nAChR-mediated responses is developmentally regulated, with both being absent in samples taken from rats at postnatal day 7, but later becoming present and increasing over the next 2 weeks. Collectively, this electrophysiological, pharmacological, and molecular evidence indicates that nAChR alpha7 subunits and functional alpha7-nAChRs are expressed somatodendritically by midbrain DA neurons, where they may play important physiological roles and contribute to nicotine reinforcement and dependence.

25637936|t|The terminal enzymes of cholesterol synthesis, DHCR24 and DHCR7, interact physically and functionally.
25637936|a|Cholesterol is essential to human health, and its levels are tightly regulated by a balance of synthesis, uptake, and efflux. Cholesterol synthesis requires the actions of more than twenty enzymes to reach the final product, through two alternate pathways. Here we describe a physical and functional interaction between the two terminal enzymes. 24-Dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24) and 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7) coimmunoprecipitate, and when the DHCR24 gene is knocked down by siRNA, DHCR7 activity is also ablated. Conversely, overexpression of DHCR24 enhances DHCR7 activity, but only when a functional form of DHCR24 is used. DHCR7 is important for both cholesterol and vitamin D synthesis, and we have identified a novel layer of regulation, whereby its activity is controlled by DHCR24. This suggests the existence of a cholesterol "metabolon", where enzymes from the same metabolic pathway interact with each other to provide a substrate channeling benefit. We predict that other enzymes in cholesterol synthesis may similarly interact, and this should be explored in future studies.

11459183|t|Functional analysis of TamA, a coactivator of nitrogen-regulated gene expression in Aspergillus nidulans.
11459183|a|The tam A gene of Aspergillus nidulans encodes a 739-amino acid protein with similarity to Uga35p/Dal81p/DurLp of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It has been proposed that TamA functions as a co-activator of AreA, the major nitrogen regulatory protein in A. nidulans. Because AreA functions as a transcriptional activator under nitrogen-limiting conditions, we investigated whether TamA was also present in the nucleus. We found that a GFP-TamA fusion protein was predominantly localised to the nucleus in the presence and absence of ammonium, and that AreA was not required for this distribution. As the predicted DNA-binding domain of TamA is not essential for function, we have used a number of approaches to further define functionally important regions. We have cloned the tamA gene of A. oryzae and compared its functional and sequence characteristics with those of A. nidulans tamA and S. cerevisiae UGA35/DAL81/DURL. The Aspergillus homologues are highly conserved and functionally interchangeable, whereas the S. cerevisiae gene does not complement a tamA mutant when expressed in A. nidulans. Uga35p/Dal81p/DurLp was also found to be unable to recruit AreA. The sequence changes in a number of tamA mutant alleles were determined, and altered versions of TamA were tested for tamA complementation and interaction with AreA. Changes in most regions of TamA appeared to destroy its function, suggesting that the overall conformation of the protein may be critical for its activity.

28743128|t|Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors Protect Retinal Pigment Epithelium Cells Against Oxidation by Modulating Nitric Oxide Release and Autophagy.
28743128|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: the anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF), Aflibercept and Ranibizumab, are used for the treatment of macular degeneration. Here we examined the involvement of nitric oxide (NO), mitochondria function and of apoptosis/autophagy in their antioxidant effects in human retinal pigment epithelium cells (RPE). METHODS: RPE were exposed to Ranibizumab/Aflibercept in the absence or presence of NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor and of autophagy activator/blocker, rapamicyn/3-methyladenine. Specific kits were used for cell viability, NO and reactive oxygen species detection and mitochondrial membrane potential measurement, whereas Western Blot was performed for apoptosis/ autophagy markers and other kinases detection. RESULTS: In RPE cultured in physiological conditions, Aflibercept/Ranibizumab increased NO release in a dose and time-dependent way. Opposite results were obtained in RPE pretreated with hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, both the anti-VEGF agents were able to prevent the fall of cell viability and of mitochondrial membrane potential. Those effects were reduced by the NOS inhibitor and 3-methyladenine and were potentiated by rapamycin. Finally, Aflibercept and Ranibizumab counteracted the changes of apoptosis/autophagy markers, NOS, Phosphatidylinositol-3-Kinase/Protein Kinase B and Extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 caused by peroxidation. CONCLUSION: Aflibercept and Ranibizumab protect RPE against peroxidation through the modulation of NO release, apoptosis and autophagy.

26091703|t|Resveratrol increases glycolytic flux in Saccharomyces cerevisiae via a SNF1-dependet mechanism.
26091703|a|Evidence suggests that AMP protein kinase (AMPK) is the main target of the phytochemical resveratrol (RSV) in mammalian cells. Data also indicates that RSV stimulates glucose metabolism; however, the molecular link between RSV and glucose uptake remains unknown. Herein, we provide evidence indicating that RSV stimulates glycolysis via sucrose non-fermenting 1 gene (SNF1, Saccharomyces cerevisiae orthologous of AMPK). S. cerevisiae cultures treated with 30 μM RSV showed an increase in extracellular acidification rate compared to untreated cells, indicating an elevated glycolytic flux. Also, RSV treatment increased transcription levels of two key glycolytic genes, hexokinase 2 (HXK2) and phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1), as well as production of NADH. Moreover, RSV treatment inhibited mitochondrial respiration when glucose was used as a carbon source. Importantly, the effects of RSV on glycolysis were dependent of SNF1. Taken together, these findings suggest that SNF1 (AMPK in mammalian systems) is the molecular target of RSV in S. cerevisiae.

26806323|t|The combination of a novel 2 bp deletion mutation and p.D63H in CYP11B1 cause congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to steroid 11β-hydroxylase deficiency.
26806323|a|Deficiency of steroid 11β-hydroxylase activity occurs in 5-8% of patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). The aim of the current study was to identify mutations in the CYP11B1 gene of a patient with CAH due to deficiency of steroid 11β-hydroxylase activity, and to study the functional and structural consequences of these mutations. A molecular genetic analysis of the CYP11B1 gene in this patient and her parents identified a known missense mutation g.5194G>C (p.D63H) and a novel 2 bp deletion mutation (g.9525_9526delCT, corresponding to p.L380V…R420X) in the patient. In vitro expression studies in COS7 cells revealed a decreased 11β-hydroxylase activity in the p.D63H mutant to 2.0±0.8% and in the p.L380V…R420X mutant to 0.2±2.2% for the conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol. Three dimensional homology models for the normal and mutant proteins were built by using the recently published x-ray structure of the human CYP11B2 as a template. Presumably, the g.9525_9526delCT mutation in CYP11B1 resulted in a truncated protein with a misfolded C-terminal domain that could not efficiently bind heme iron, substrate, and adrenodoxin and had lost its biochemical function. In summary, CAH due to steroid 11β-hydroxylase deficiency can be attributed to both the novel deletion mutation (g.9525_9526delCT, corresponding to p.L380V…R420X) and known missense mutation (g.5194G>C corresponding to p.D63H) in CYP11B1.

9699963|t|Extracellular superoxide dismutase localization and activity within the human placenta.
9699963|a|Maintenance of low vascular tone within the placenta is mediated by nitric oxide (NO). The half-life of NO is very short, as superoxide anion (O2-) rapidly inactivates NO to form peroxynitrite. Superoxide dismutases compete with NO for O2-. By scavenging O2-, superoxide dismutase promotes the vasodilatory action of NO. Extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) is present in high concentrations within the extracellular matrix of systemic arteries and has been proposed to mediate vascular smooth muscle tone by increasing NO bioavailability. The localization and activity of EC-SOD within the human placenta has not been determined. Placental EC-SOD may be involved in placental vascular tone, and abnormal activity may lead to pre-eclampsia secondary to increased O2--mediated inactivation of NO. To investigate this possibility, the activity and localization of human placental EC-SOD was determined in normal women, and then compared to pre-eclamptic women. Placental EC-SOD localized within the villous extracellular matrix around arterioles, and there were no differences in distribution between normal and pre-eclamptic women. There were no differences in placental EC-SOD activity between normal and pre-eclamptic subjects in either center (33.7+/-4.1 versus 33.1+/-2.5, P=0.6), or peripheral (34.3+/-5.6 versus 34.0+/-3.5, P=0.9) samples. EC-SOD localization around villous vessels suggests that EC-SOD serves potentially to protect the fetal vasculature from O2-, in both normal and pre-eclamptic pregnancies. Placental EC-SOD distribution and activity is not different between pre-eclamptic and normal women, suggesting that EC-SOD is not involved in the vascular changes seen in pre-eclampsia.

17951469|t|In utero and postnatal exposure to long chain (n-3) PUFA enhances intestinal glucose absorption and energy stores in weanling pigs.
17951469|a|The aim of this research was to determine whether feeding gestating and lactating sows (n-3) PUFA [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and/or docosahexenoic acid (DHA)] or coconut fat (saturated fat) influences ex vivo glucose absorption in the proximal jejunum and glucose and glycogen concentration of liver and muscle of their offspring at weaning. Sows were fed 1 of 4 diets for 150 d, which included the entire gestation and lactation periods. The diets consisted of basal corn/soybean meal (CONT), CONT + protected EPA and DHA-rich fish oil (PFO), CONT + DHA Gold fat (DHAGF), and CONT + coconut fat (COCO). All tissues were collected from piglets (n = 4 per treatment) following a 24-h period of food deprivation, which was initiated at weaning. Proximal jejunum samples were mounted in modified Ussing chambers for transport determinations. Relative to the CONT (7 muA/cm(2)), active glucose transport was greater (P = 0.013) in piglets from sows fed the PFO (30 microA/cm(2)) and DHAGF (40 microA/cm(2)) diets, but not the COCO diet (19 microA/cm(2); pooled SEM = 5). Likewise, jejunum expression of glucose transporter 2 and sodium glucose transporter 1 protein tended (P < 0.10) to be greater in piglets from dams fed the PFO and DHAGF diets, as did AMP-activated protein kinase activity. Piglets' muscle glycogen was greater than in CONT (34 +/- 5.2 mg/g wet tissue) only in piglets from dams fed the DHAGF (46 +/- 5.2 mg/g wet tissue; P < 0.05). These results indicate that (n-3) PUFA, particularly DHA, improves intestinal glucose absorption and muscle glycogen concentrations in newly weaned pigs. These findings may also have important implications for human mothers and infants.

19576425|t|Second-order calibration of excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectra for determination of glutathione in human plasma.
19576425|a|A rapid non-separative spectroflourimetric method based on the second-order calibration of the excitation-emission data matrix was proposed for the determination of glutathione (GSH) in human plasma. In the phosphate buffer solution of pH 8.0 GSH reacts with ortho-phthaldehyde (OPA) to yield a fluorescent adduct with maximum fluorescence intensity at about 420 nm. To handle the interfering effects of the OPA adducts with aminothiols other than GSH in plasma as well as intrinsic fluorescence of human plasma, parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis as an efficient three-way calibration method was employed. In addition, to model the indirect interfering effect of the plasma matrix, PARAFAC was coupled with standard addition method. The two-component PARAFAC modeling of the excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectra accurately resolved the excitation and emission spectra of GSH, plasma (or plasma constituents). The concentration-related PARAFAC score of GSH represented a linear correlation with the concentration of added GSH, similar to that is obtained in simple standard addition method. Using this standard addition curve, the GSH level in plasma was found to be 6.10+/-1.37 micromol L(-1). The accuracy of the method was investigated by analysis of the plasma samples spiked with 1.0 micromol L(-1) of GSH and a recovery of 97.5% was obtained.

23173738|t|Use of near-infrared spectroscopy to identify trends in regional cerebral oxygen saturation in horses.
23173738|a|REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Alterations in cerebral haemodynamics may contribute to perianaesthetic complications in horses. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is frequently used intraoperatively in man to provide information regarding cerebral perfusion. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether NIRS can identify trends in regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) in horses and whether there is a correlation between rSO2 and venous oxygen tensions. METHODS: A cerebral oximeter sensor recorded rSO2 from the dorsal sagittal sinus of 6 healthy horses. Values for rSO2, arterial and venous oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions (PaO2, PvO2, PaCO2 and PvCO2 respectively), along with arteriovenous oxygen saturations (SavO2) were recorded in unsedated (recording period [RP] 1), sedated (RP2) and anaesthetised horses (RP3-5) and during recovery (RP6-8). During anaesthesia, horses were ventilated to achieve states of normo- (RP3), hyper- (RP4) and hypocapnoea (RP5). Data were evaluated descriptively and analysed using linear mixed-effects models and Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Overall mean ± s.d. values for rSO2, PaO2, PvO2, PaCO2, SavO2 and mean arterial pressure varied significantly by RP (P<0.001). Significant decreases in rSO2 were identified between RP1 and the post anaesthetic periods (P<0.001). No significant differences in rSO2 values were identified between RP1 and the intra-anaesthesia periods or between RP3, RP4 and RP5. Significant correlations were identified between rSO2 and PaO2 (r = 0.448, P<0.001), rSO2 and PvO2 (r = 0.512, P<0.001) and rSO2 and SavO2 (r = 0.469, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to identify trends in rSO2 in horses using NIRS. A positive correlation was identified between rSO2 and PvO2, suggesting that alterations in cerebral oxygenation may be reflected in PvO2 . POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: Near-infrared spectroscopy may be used to monitor trends in rSO2 during equine anaesthesia. Decreasing rSO2 values may act as an early warning signal, alerting clinicians to potential cerebral desaturation events and indicating a need for intervention.

3678950|t|Short chain fatty acids in human large intestine, portal, hepatic and venous blood.
3678950|a|Evidence for the occurrence of microbial breakdown of carbohydrate in the human colon has been sought by measuring short chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations in the contents of all regions of the large intestine and in portal, hepatic and peripheral venous blood obtained at autopsy of sudden death victims within four hours of death. Total SCFA concentration (mmol/kg) was low in the terminal ileum at 13 +/- 6 but high in all regions of the colon ranging from 131 +/- 9 in the caecum to 80 +/- 11 in the descending colon. The presence of branched chain fatty acids was also noted. A significant trend from high to low concentrations was found on passing distally from caecum to descending colon. pH also changed with region from 5.6 +/- 0.2 in the caecum to 6.6 +/- 0.1 in the descending colon. pH and SCFA concentrations were inversely related. Total SCFA (mumol/l) in blood was, portal 375 +/- 70, hepatic 148 +/- 42 and peripheral 79 +/- 22. In all samples acetate was the principal anion but molar ratios of the three principal SCFA changed on going from colonic contents to portal blood to hepatic vein indicating greater uptake of butyrate by the colonic epithelium and propionate by the liver. These data indicate that substantial carbohydrate, and possibly protein, fermentation is occurring in the human large intestine, principally in the caecum and ascending colon and that the large bowel may have a greater role to play in digestion than has previously been ascribed to it.

22310389|t|KlRox1p contributes to yeast resistance to metals and is necessary for KlYCF1 expression in the presence of cadmium.
22310389|a|We have characterized the KlROX1 gene from Kluyveromyces lactis and verified that it does not regulate the hypoxic response in this yeast, oppositely to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue ScROX1. The KlROX1 promoter is not regulated by KlHap1p or KlRox1p in response to changes aerobiosis/hypoxia. Besides, KlRox1p expression only partially represses ScANB1 in S. cerevisiae and does not regulate the ScANB1 and KlHEM13 promoters in K. lactis. KlRox1p does not interact either with KlTup1p or KlSsn6p or with their homologues ScTup1p and ScSsn6p, which are components of the general co-repressor factor that mediates the transcriptional repression exerted by ScRox1p in S. cerevisiae. We have found that KlROX1 mediates the response to arsenate and cadmium and, in the presence of cadmium, it is necessary for KlYCF1 expression, a gene encoding a protein with homology to the yeast cadmium and arsenite vacuolar transporter. EMSA assays show that KlRox1p binds, through its HMG domain, to a DNA sequence present in the KlYCF1 promoter. Although in S. cerevisiae the function of ScRox1p in cadmium resistance was already known and linked to regulation of ScFET4 expression, we have found that ScRox1p also regulates ScYCF1transcription and binds to its promoter.

16772231|t|TNF-alpha activates human monocytes for Paracoccidioides brasiliensis killing by an H2O2-dependent mechanism.
16772231|a|Human monocytes activated by recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) exhibited significant fungicidal activity on the yeast cells of a highly virulent strain of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. This process was significantly inhibited in the presence of catalase (CAT - a scavenger of H2O2), but not in the presence of superoxide-dismutase (SOD - a scavenger of superoxide anion) or NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (NG-MMLA - a nitric oxide inhibitor). Furthermore, there was a direct association between the intracellular killing of the fungus and the production of H2O2 by activated cells. These results strongly suggest a role for H2O2 in the killing of highly virulent strains of P. brasiliensis by TNF-alpha-activated human monocytes.

17449811|t|SCABP8/CBL10, a putative calcium sensor, interacts with the protein kinase SOS2 to protect Arabidopsis shoots from salt stress.
17449811|a|The SOS (for Salt Overly Sensitive) pathway plays essential roles in conferring salt tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana. Under salt stress, the calcium sensor SOS3 activates the kinase SOS2 that positively regulates SOS1, a plasma membrane sodium/proton antiporter. We show that SOS3 acts primarily in roots under salt stress. By contrast, the SOS3 homolog SOS3-LIKE CALCIUM BINDING PROTEIN8 (SCABP8)/CALCINEURIN B-LIKE10 functions mainly in the shoot response to salt toxicity. While root growth is reduced in sos3 mutants in the presence of NaCl, the salt sensitivity of scabp8 is more prominent in shoot tissues. SCABP8 is further shown to bind calcium, interact with SOS2 both in vitro and in vivo, recruit SOS2 to the plasma membrane, enhance SOS2 activity in a calcium-dependent manner, and activate SOS1 in yeast. In addition, sos3 scabp8 and sos2 scabp8 display a phenotype similar to sos2, which is more sensitive to salt than either sos3 or scabp8 alone. Overexpression of SCABP8 in sos3 partially rescues the sos3 salt-sensitive phenotype. However, overexpression of SOS3 fails to complement scabp8. These results suggest that SCABP8 and SOS3 are only partially redundant in their function, and each plays additional and unique roles in the plant salt stress response.

19619435|t|[Establishment and biological characteristics of a human ovarian carcinoma cell line originated from peritoneal effusion].
19619435|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Establishing ovarian cancer cell lines will benefit researches on biological characteristics of ovarian cancer stem cells and antitumor drugs. This study was to establish a human ovarian carcinoma cell line from peritoneal effusion, and explore its biological characteristics. METHODS: Cells were isolated from peritoneal effusion of an ovarian carcinoma patient, purified and cultured in vitro. The morphology of the cells was observed under electromicroscope. The growth curve of cells was drawn to calculate cell doubling time (TD). Cell karyotype was analyzed. The levels of sex hormone, and the expression of CA125 and CA19-9 in cell culture supernate were detected by radioimmunoassay. The cells were transplanted into nude mice to observe tumor formation. RESULTS: A new ovarian carcinoma cell line was established, which had been maintained in vitro for over 100 passages in two years. Abnormal nuclei were observed under electromicroscope. TD was 40.8 h. The karyotype of the cells was hyperdiploid with 63-120 chromosomes. The level of estradiol in cell culture supernate was 45.0 pg/mL; the level of testosterone was 0.03 ng/mL; pregnendione was undetected; the level of CA125 was 4.49 U/mL; the level of CA19-9 was 4.09 U/mL. Poorly differentiated ovarian adenocarcinoma was formed subcutaneously in nude mice after transplantation. CONCLUSION: The new ovarian carcinoma cell line is proved to be an immortalized and malignant cell line.

27590528|t|Human airway epithelial cells investigated by atomic force microscopy: A hint to cystic fibrosis epithelial pathology.
27590528|a|The pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis (CF) airway disease stems from mutations in the CF Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene, leading to a chronic respiratory disease. Actin cytoskeleton is disorganized in CF airway epithelial cells, likely contributing to the CF-associated basic defects, i.e. defective chloride secretion and sodium/fluid hypersorption. In this work, we aimed to find whether this alteration could be pointed out by means of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) investigation, as roughness and Young's elastic module. Moreover, we also sought to determine whether disorganization of actin cytoskeleton is linked to hypersoption of apical fluid. Not only CFBE41o- (CFBE) cells, immortalized airway epithelial cells homozygous for the F508del CFTR allele, showed a different morphology in comparison with 16HBE14o- (16HBE) epithelial cells, wild-type for CFTR, but also they displayed a lack of stress fibers, suggestive of a disorganized actin cytoskeleton. AFM measurements showed that CFBE cells presented a higher membrane roughness and decreased rigidity as compared with 16HBE cells. CFBE overexpressing wtCFTR became more elongated than the parental CFBE cell line and presented actin stress fibers. CFBE cells absorbed more fluid from the apical compartment. Study of fluid absorption with the F-actin-depolymerizing agent Latrunculin B demonstrated that actin cytoskeletal disorganization increased fluid absorption, an effect observed at higher magnitude in 16HBE than in CFBE cells. For the first time, we demonstrate that actin cytoskeleton disorganization is reflected by AFM parameters in CF airway epithelial cells. Our data also strongly suggest that the lack of stress fibers is involved in at least one of the early step in CF pathophysiology at the levels of the airways, i.e. fluid hypersorption.

9484997|t|Contrasting patterns of spontaneous aortic disease in young and old rabbits.
9484997|a|The pattern of spontaneous lipid deposition around aortic branch ostia was mapped in New Zealand White rabbits aged 1 month or 2 to 6 years. The young rabbits were studied within 1 day of weaning, and the older rabbits had been maintained on a low-protein, low-fat diet. Plasma concentrations of total cholesterol for the two groups averaged 75 and 18 mg/dL, respectively. Aortas were fixed in situ at a pressure of 90 to 100 cm H2O, stained with oil red O, and photographed en face under an epifluorescence microscope. Areas of staining contrasted in color with the fixative-stimulated autofluorescence of nondiseased tissue and were mapped by placing grids over the photomicrographs. Disease around intercostal ostia was rare, but two distributions were established by combining data from many branches. In weanlings, staining was seen within a triangular area downstream of the branch. In old animals, this area had the lowest frequency of disease; lesions tended to occur downstream of the spared region, along axes lying to either side of it, and at the lateral and upstream margins of the ostium. Disease was less rare at celiac branches. It occurred mainly downstream of the ostium in weanlings, whereas upstream sites were most affected in old animals, although significant disease remained at the juvenile locations. Earlier reports have described similar age-related distributions of disease in human aortas, consistent with a common underlying mechanism. The distributions also correlate with the spatial variations in arterial transport properties established in previous studies, and may be determined by them.

2159322|t|Evidence for an inhibitory effect exerted by yeast NMN adenylyltransferase on poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity.
2159322|a|We have previously reported for the first time the purification to homogeneity of the enzyme NMN adenylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.1) from yeast and its major molecular and catalytic properties. The homogeneous enzyme was found to be a glycoprotein containing 2% carbohydrate and 1 mol of adenine residue and 2 mol of phosphate covalently bound per mole of protein. Such a stoichiometry, apparently consistent with that of ADP-ribose, prompted us to further investigate the possibility that NMN adenylyltransferase could be subjected to poly(ADP-ribosylation) in vitro in a reconstituted system. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase was purified to homogeneity from bull testis by means of a rapid procedure involving two batchwise steps on DNA-agarose and Reactive Blue 2 cross-linked agarose and a column affinity chromatography step on 3-aminobenzamide-Sepharose; the optimal conditions for the poly(ADP-ribosylation) of exogenous substrates were determined. When pure NMN adenylyltransferase was incubated in the presence of the homogeneous poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, a marked inhibition of the polymerase was observed, both in the presence and in the absence of histones, while the activity of NMN adenylyltransferase was not affected. The inhibition could not be prevented by increasing the concentrations of either DNA or NAD. Mg2+ did not affect the activity or the inhibition. The significance of such a phenomenon is at present unknown, but it may be of biological relevance in view of the close topological and metabolic relationship between the two enzymes.

6221096|t|Creatine kinase and ATPase in human seminal fluid and prostatic fluid.
6221096|a|A creatine kinase assay based on estimation of creatine liberated from creatine phosphate was accurate and reproducible for use with seminal or prostatic fluid, after allowance was made for acid phosphatase interference. Comparison of this method with one which relies on enzymic coupling of ATP formation to NADP+ oxidation shows that the latter under-estimates creatine kinase activity by a factor of about 3. This discrepancy could be due to the high ATPase activity found in prostatic and seminal fluid. Uncritical use of the NADP+ assay might account for different seminal creatine kinase values reported in the literature. Interrelationships between ATPase, creatine kinase and zinc suggest that seminal ATPase is a prostatic secretory product while creatine kinase may be multiglandular in origin.

1115144|t|Serum androstenedione levels during normal and human menopausal gonadotropin-induced human pregnancies.
1115144|a|17-Hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) and androstenedione (A) were measured frequently during the first trimester of five human pregnancies. Two were normally conceived and three were HMG induced. Of the HMG induced, two showed signs of hyperstimulation and one did not. 17-OHP and A patterns were very similar in the HMG-induced pregnancies from about days 25 to 60, after which the 17-OHP levels continued to drop. The A remained fairly constant after that time. In the normally conceived pregnancies the 17-OHP showed its characteristic rise and fall from about days 25 to 60, but A remained relatively constant throughout this period of time. The pattern of A in normal pregnancies is in marked contrast to that observed in HMG-induced pregnancies. Results from HMG-induced pregnancied may not, therefore, be always applicable to normal ones.

9758847|t|Balance of activities of alcohol acetyltransferase and esterase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is important for production of isoamyl acetate.
9758847|a|Isoamyl acetate is synthesized from isoamyl alcohol and acetyl coenzyme A by alcohol acetyltransferase (AATFase) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and is hydrolyzed by esterases at the same time. We hypothesized that the balance of both enzyme activities was important for optimum production of isoamyl acetate in sake brewing. To test this hypothesis, we constructed yeast strains with different numbers of copies of the AATFase gene (ATF1) and the isoamyl acetate-hydrolyzing esterase gene (IAH1) and used these strains in small-scale sake brewing. Fermentation profiles as well as components of the resulting sake were largely alike; however, the amount of isoamyl acetate in the sake increased with an increasing ratio of AATFase/Iah1p esterase activity. Therefore, we conclude that the balance of these two enzyme activities is important for isoamyl acetate accumulation in sake mash.

2666696|t|[An immunohistochemical study of endogenous estradiol and testosterone in human colo-rectal cancer tissues].
2666696|a|An immunohistochemical method (peroxidase antiperoxidase method) was carried out to examine the distribution of endogenous estradiol (E2) and testosterone (Te). One hundred and twenty four (48.2%) of 257 colo-rectal cancer cases, and 36.7% of male cases and 58.4% of female cases revealed E2-immunostain. This immunohistochemical reaction for E2 was found more frequently in female patients than in male patients, while Te-immunostain was found in 15 (17.6%) of 85 colo-rectal cancer cases. E2 and Te were demonstrated mainly in the cytoplasms and occasionally in the nuclei of cancer cells. Since E2 or Te-positive cancer cells were mainly distributed in the deeper or invasive portion of tissue sections, it might deserve further investigation to elucidate a certain relationship between cancer growth and endogenous sex-hormones.

20232292|t|Acetate, the key modulator of inflammatory responses in acute alcoholic hepatitis.
20232292|a|UNLABELLED: Acute alcoholic hepatitis is characterized by disproportionate macrophage inflammatory cytokine responses to bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Lack of knowledge of the underlying mechanism has limited progress toward effective therapy. We postulated a novel mechanism by which ethanol increases histone acetylation, increasing proinflammatory gene transcription and cytokine synthesis. Cytokine responses to lipopolysaccharide in a human macrophage cell line cultured in 86 mM ethanol, 1 mM acetate, and normal media were measured by multiplex immunoassay. Changes in histone acetylation were determined by immunofluorescence microscopy and chromatin immunoprecipitation on presentation. The effect of ethanol and acetate on acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-coA) synthetases, which convert acetate to acetyl-coA, the substrate for histone acetylation, was determined by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting. Knockdown of acetyl-coA synthetases by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to determine their role in ethanol's enhancement of the inflammatory cytokine response. Ethanol-exposed macrophages developed enhanced interleukin 6 (IL6), IL8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha responses to lipopolysaccharide with time-dependent increases in histone acetylation that could be prevented by inhibition of ethanol metabolism. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed increased histone acetylation at promoter regions of specific cytokine genes. The effect of ethanol was reproduced by incubation with acetate, the principal hepatic metabolite of ethanol, and both ethanol and acetate reduced histone deacetylase activity and up-regulated acetyl-coA synthetases. Knockdown of the acetyl-coA synthetases abrogated the effect of ethanol on cytokine production. CONCLUSION: Synthesis of metabolically available acetyl-coA from acetate is critical to the increased acetylation of proinflammatory gene histones and consequent enhancement of the inflammatory response in ethanol-exposed macrophages. This mechanism is a potential therapeutic target in acute alcoholic hepatitis.

9863535|t|Dyslipoproteinaemia and hyperoxidative stress in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction in non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus: an hypothesis.
9863535|a|Endothelial dysfunction in non-insulin dependent (Type 2) diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) has implications for the pathogenesis of the two major complications, macrovascular disease and microangiopathy. Endothelial dysfunction is a consequence of a disturbance in the L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway. Its occurrence in NIDDM is well supported by both in vitro and in vivo studies. NIDDM results in diverse abnormalities in lipoprotein metabolism, the most significant being hypertriglyceridaemia which is associated with increased plasma concentrations of small dense LDL and low levels of HDL. Dysglycaemia results in hyperoxidative stress and increased formation of advanced-glycosylation endproducts, both of which enhance the oxidative modification of lipoprotein particles. Based on extensive in vitro studies and on human data, we generate the hypothesis that the development of endothelial dysfunction in NIDDM is a consequence of the effect of dyslipoproteinaemia, in particular increased circulatory concentrations of modified small dense LDL and of hyperoxidative stress on the formation, action and disposal of nitric oxide, by diverse molecular mechanisms; HDL is proposed to have a protective effect on these processes through its enzymic antioxidant properties. The hypothesis proposed is simple, testable and consistent with wide sources of evidence. The practical implications of the hypothesis and the existing opportunities for the prevention and reversal of endothelial dysfunction in NIDDM are also reviewed and discussed.

27725338|t|Toward mimicking the bone structure: design of novel hierarchical scaffolds with a tailored radial porosity gradient.
27725338|a|Guiding bone regeneration poses still unmet challenges due to several drawbacks of current standard treatments in the clinics. A possible solution may rely on the use of three-dimensional scaffolds with optimized structural properties in combination with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Bone presents a radial gradient structure from the outside, where the cortical bone is more compact (porosity ranging from 5% to 10%), toward the inner part, where the cancellous bone is more porous (porosity ranging from 50% to 90%). Here, we present a new scaffold design with a built-in gradient in porosity, which approximate the radial bone structure. The pores of the outer ring were 500 μm, the ones in the middle zone were 750 μm and the inner part presented pores of 1000 μm. The porosity of each scaffold region resembled the gradient present in bone, with the outer ring having a porosity of 29.6% ± 5%, the middle and inner regions a porosity of 50.8% ± 8.1% and 77.6% ± 3.2% respectively. hMSCs behavior was analyzed in terms of growth, extracellular matrix deposition and differentiation toward the osteogenic lineage. A trend was displayed by the hMSCs residing in different zones of the gradient scaffolds after 7, 14 and 28 days of culture in mineralization medium. Osteogenic differentiation was influenced by pore size and location in scaffolds displaying a radial porosity gradient. Cell differentiation was confirmed by gene expression with upregulation of Runx2 and bone sialoprotein markers. Mineralization staining further confirmed the maturation of cell differentiation, as indicated by the presence of calcium and phosphate mineral deposits.

12631268|t|Human acid sphingomyelinase.
12631268|a|Human acid sphingomyelinase (haSMase, EC 3.1.4.12) catalyzes the lysosomal degradation of sphingomyelin to ceramide and phosphorylcholine. An inherited haSMase deficiency leads to Niemann-Pick disease, a severe sphingolipid storage disorder. The enzyme was purified and cloned over 10 years ago. Since then, only a few structural properties of haSMase have been elucidated. For understanding of its complex functions including its role in certain signaling and apoptosis events, complete structural information about the enzyme is necessary. Here, the identification of the disulfide bond pattern of haSMase is reported for the first time. Functional recombinant enzyme expressed in SF21 cells using the baculovirus expression system was purified and digested by trypsin. MALDI-MS analysis of the resulting peptides revealed the four disulfide bonds Cys120-Cys131, Cys385-Cys431, Cys584-Cys588 and Cys594-Cys607. Two additional disulfide bonds (Cys221-Cys226 and Cys227-Cys250) which were not directly accessible by tryptic cleavage, were identified by a combination of a method of partial reduction and MALDI-PSD analysis. In the sphingolipid activator protein (SAP)-homologous N-terminal domain of haSMase, one disulfide bond was assigned as Cys120-Cys131. The existence of two additional disulfide bridges in this region was proved, as was expected for the known disulfide bond pattern of SAP-type domains. These results support the hypothesis that haSMase possesses an intramolecular SAP-type activator domain as predicted by sequence comparison [Ponting, C.P. (1994) Protein Sci., 3, 359-361]. An additional analysis of haSMase isolated from human placenta shows that the recombinant and the native human protein possess an identical disulfide structure.

12884303|t|Essential pathogenic role of endogenous IL-18 in murine diabetes induced by multiple low doses of streptozotocin. Prevention of hyperglycemia and insulitis by a recombinant IL-18-binding protein: Fc construct.
12884303|a|IL-18 is a cytokine structurally and functionally related to IL-1 that, in synergy with IL-12, stimulates the synthesis of IFN-gamma from T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Because IFN-gamma plays a key pathogenic role in the development of murine immunoinflammatory diabetes induced by multiple low doses of streptozotocin (STZ) we investigated the effect of negating the actions of endogenous IL-18 in this model by administering recombinant IL-18-binding protein:Fc (IL-18 bp:Fc). C57BL/6 mice were injected once daily with 40 mg/kg STZ for 5 consecutive days, day 0 being the first day of STZ challenge. Relative to control animals treated in parallel with either PBS or human IgG, mice treated from day -3 to day 7 with daily doses of 150 microg of IL-18 bp:Fc exhibited lower incidence of diabetes and milder insulitis. In contrast, mice that were treated with IL-18 bp:Fc from day 7 to day 14 exhibited clinical and histological signs of STZ-induced diabetes similar to those of control mice treated with IgG. The protective effect of IL-18 bp:Fc was accompanied by modified ex vivo immune responses, in that spleen cells and peritoneal macrophages contained fewer IFN-gamma secreting cells and released lower amounts of nitrite (an index of nitric oxide production) and IL-1beta. We conclude that intact IL-18 function is essential for the full diabetogenic effect of low dose STZ in C57BL/6 mice.

19448003|t|Identification and characterization of the bovine G protein-coupled receptor GPR41 and GPR43 genes.
19448003|a|Volatile fatty acids (VFA), including acetate, propionate, and butyrate, are not only a primary source of energy, but also regulate rumen development, insulin and glucagon secretion, and other physiological processes in cattle and sheep. The mechanism underlying the regulatory effects of VFA is unknown. Recent "reverse pharmacology" studies identified human G protein-coupled receptors GPR41 and GPR43 as receptors for short-chain fatty acids. It is possible that proteins similar to human GPR41 and GPR43 mediate the regulatory effects of VFA in cattle. In this study, we determined first, whether the bovine genome contains genes similar to the human GPR41 and GPR43 genes; second, whether and where these genes are expressed in cattle; and third, if the proteins encoded by these genes can be activated by acetate, propionate, and butyrate. A search of GenBank revealed bovine genomic sequences and expressed sequence tags highly similar to the human GPR41 and GPR43 DNA and cDNA sequences. The protein-coding and 5' untranslated regions of the bovine GPR41 and GPR43 mRNA were cloned and sequenced from spleen tissue. Based on these sequences, the bovine GPR41 gene contains 3 exons and its transcription is initiated at 2 leader exons, generating 2 GPR41 mRNA variants differing in the 5' untranslated region. The bovine GPR43 gene contains 2 exons and transcription of this gene is initiated from a single start site. The amino acid sequences deduced from the bovine GPR41 and GPR43 mRNA sequences are more than 75% identical to those of the human GPR41 and GPR43 and are predicted to encode 7 transmembrane domains, typical of G protein-coupled receptors. Both bovine GPR41 and GPR43 mRNA were detected in a variety of tissues including rumen and pancreas. In a cell system, interaction of the overexpressed bovine GPR41 or GPR43 protein with acetate, propionate, or butyrate inhibited luciferase reporter expression from a cyclic AMP-responsive promoter, suggesting that the bovine GPR41 and GPR43 proteins couple to Galpha(i/11). In total, these results demonstrate that the bovine genome encodes functional GPR41 and GPR43 genes and suggest that GPR41 and GPR43 may play a role in the regulatory effects of VFA in cattle.

2263463|t|Preparation and characterization of yeast nuclear extracts for efficient RNA polymerase B (II)-dependent transcription in vitro.
2263463|a|We present a reproducible method for the preparation of nuclear extracts from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that support efficient RNA polymerase B (II)-dependent transcription. Extracts from both a crude nuclear fraction and Percoll-purified nuclei are highly active for site-specific initiation and transcription of a G-free cassette under the Adenovirus major late promoter. At optimal extract concentrations transcription is at least 5 times more efficient with the yeast extracts than with HeLa whole cell extracts. We show that the transcriptional activity is sensitive to alpha-amanitin and to depletion of factor(s) recognizing the TATA-box of the promoter. The in vitro reaction showed maximal activity after 45 min, was very sensitive to Cl-, but was not affected by high concentrations of potassium. We find that the efficiency of in vitro transcription in nuclear extracts is reproducibly high when spheroplasting is performed with a partially purified beta 1,3-glucanase (lyticase). Therefore a simplified method to isolate the lyticase from the supernatant of Oerskovia xanthineolytica is also presented.

17916662|t|Chronic treatment with tetrahydrobiopterin reverses endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress in hypercholesterolaemia.
17916662|a|BACKGROUND: Reduced availability of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)), an essential cofactor of nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS), decreases NO production and increases reactive oxygen species. Both mechanisms contribute to atherosclerotic vascular disease. Although acute supplementation of BH(4) improves endothelial dysfunction, the effect of chronic BH(4) in humans is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of chronic BH(4) supplementation on endothelial function and oxidative stress in hypercholesterolaemia. DESIGN: Randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: University Hospital. PATIENTS: 22 hypercholesterolaemic patients (low-density lipoprotein (LDL) >4.5 mmol/l) were randomised to 4 weeks of oral BH(4) (400 mg twice daily) or placebo. Age-matched healthy volunteers served as controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilatation was assessed by venous occlusion plethysmography. To elucidate the mechanisms of BH(4) effect, NO release and superoxide anion (O(2)(-)) production were measured in human aortic endothelial cells exposed to native LDL (2.6 mmol cholesterol/l). RESULTS: BH(4) plasma levels were significantly increased by oral supplementation. NO-mediated vasodilatation to acetylcholine was reduced in patients compared with controls and restored by BH(4). No effect of BH(4) on endothelium-independent vasodilatation was seen. Furthermore, 8-F(2 )isoprostane plasma levels, a marker of vascular oxidative stress, were reduced by BH(4). In LDL-treated endothelial cells, BH(4) levels and NO release were reduced and O(2)(-) production increased compared with control cells. Exogenous BH(4) normalised NO and O(2)(-) production. CONCLUSIONS: In hypercholesterolaemia, endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress can be reversed by chronic oral treatment with BH(4). Thus, BH(4) availability is essential for maintaining NO synthesis and low O(2)(-) production by endothelial NOS in vivo, and may provide a rational therapeutic approach to prevent cardiovascular disease.

17899591|t|Assessment of metabolite quantitation reproducibility in serial 3D-(1)H-MR spectroscopic imaging of human brain using stereotactic repositioning.
17899591|a|Intrasubject reproducibility of metabolite quantitation in three-dimensional proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (3D-MRSI) was investigated in 10 healthy volunteers over five separate sessions using two echo times (TEs): 144 and 30 ms. The use of a Gill-Thomas-Cosman (GTC) stereotactic head frame enabled precise subject repositioning and immobilization. Metabolite levels from each voxel in the volume of interest (VOI) were quantified using the Linear Combination of Model spectra (LCModel) analysis algorithm, and coefficients of variation (CVs) were calculated. Standard error estimates (%SD or Cramer-Rao lower bounds) generated by LCModel were used as a confidence filter. The 95% confidence interval (CI) was found for each metabolite, providing an indication of the normal fluctuation expected for 3D-MRSI. In vivo, median CVs at the %SD < or = 20 level were found to be (%CV for TE = 144 and 30 ms, respectively): N-acetyl-aspartate plus N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAA): 10.2% and 13.5%; creatine plus phosphocreatine (Cr), 14.4% and 21.7%; and choline-containing compounds (Cho), 15.2% and 18.4%. Relaxing the statistical filtering criteria to %SD < or = 30 increased median CVs by less than 5% and permitted in vivo quantitation reproducibility to be evaluated for glutamine plus glutamate (Glx) and myoinositol (Ins) for TE = 30 ms, yielding CVs of 24.0% and 21.0%, respectively.

27486093|t|Control of human energy expenditure by cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV-2.
27486093|a|Resting metabolic rate (RMR) in humans shows pronounced individual variations, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) plays a key role in control of metabolic rate, and recent studies of the subunit 4 isoform 2 (COX IV-2) indicate involvement in the cellular response to hypoxia and oxidative stress. We evaluated whether the COX subunit IV isoform composition may explain the pronounced individual variations in resting metabolic rate (RMR). RMR was determined in healthy humans by indirect calorimetry and correlated to levels of COX IV-2 and COX IV-1 in vastus lateralis. Overexpression and knock down of the COX IV isoforms were performed in primary myotubes followed by evaluation of the cell respiration and production of reactive oxygen species. Here we show that COX IV-2 protein is constitutively expressed in human skeletal muscle and strongly correlated to RMR. Primary human myotubes overexpressing COX IV-2 displayed markedly (>60%) lower respiration, reduced (>50%) cellular H2O2 production, higher resistance toward both oxidative stress, and severe hypoxia compared with control cells. These results suggest an important role of isoform COX IV-2 in the control of energy expenditure, hypoxic tolerance, and mitochondrial ROS homeostasis in humans.

15177642|t|Response of rat alveolar type II cells and human lung tumor cells towards oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide and paraquat.
15177642|a|The expression of MDR1b coding mRNA is increased in alveolar type II cells from juvenile rat lung in culture. Hydrogen peroxide and paraquat-induced further upregulation supporting that oxidative stress mediated mechanisms are involved in the regulation of MDR1b in rat lung. The expression rates of mRNA for catalase, Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) and Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) remains constant during culture and were not modulated by hydrogen peroxide or paraquat. Thus, antioxidative enzymes in primary A II cells from rat lung are not regulated by reactive oxygen species dependent mechanisms. Primary A II cells were substantially more sensitive towards paraquat-induced cytotoxicity and lipid peroxidation than the permanent human lung tumor cell lines H322 and H358. A 100 microM hydrogen peroxide for 2h induces substantial DNA damage which is not paralleled by an increased rate of lipid peroxidation. The expression rate of mRNA coding for catalase and Mn-SOD was not changed and almost the same is true for the activity of catalase and Cu/Zn-SOD. Only 50 microM paraquat induced a significant decrease in catalase activity and an increase in Cu/Zn-SOD activity.

1930739|t|Hyperbaric oxygen treatment for carbon tetrachloride poisoning.
1930739|a|Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) undergoes hepatic reductive metabolism to trichloromethyl (.CCl3) and peroxytrichloromethyl (CCl3OO.) free radicals, toxic intermediates which may initiate hepatocellular damage. Recent investigations have demonstrated a potential role for hyperoxia and hyperbaric oxygen as therapeutic interventions for CCl4 poisoning. Elevated oxygen concentrations in vitro and in vivo reduce lipid peroxidation and hepatotoxicity. In vivo studies of hyperbaric oxygen following administration of CCl4 in a rat model have shown improved survival and decreased hepatotoxicity. Case reports of human poisoning, with potentially lethal ingested doses of CCl4, also suggest a potential role for treatment with hyperbaric oxygen. Hyperoxia may act by altering the metabolism of CCl4. These studies and case reports support the recommendation that 100% normobaric and hyperbaric oxygen should be treatment considerations for CCl4 poisoning.

13130049|t|Acinetobacter parvus sp. nov., a small-colony-forming species isolated from human clinical specimens.
13130049|a|The taxonomic status of seven glucose-non-acidifying, non-proteolytic Acinetobacter strains characterized by forming small colonies on agar media was studied. With one exception, all strains were from human specimens. They could be distinguished from all described Acinetobacter (genomic) species by their ability to grow on ethanol and acetate as sole sources of carbon but not on 22 other substrates tested including DL-lactate or DL-4-aminobutyrate. DNA-DNA hybridization studies, 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, amplified rDNA restriction analysis and DNA polymorphism analysis by AFLP showed that these strains represent a hitherto unknown species of the genus Acinetobacter, for which the name Acinetobacter parvus (type strain LMG 21765(T)=LUH 4616(T)=NIPH 384(T)=CCM 7030(T)) is proposed.

7943398|t|Effects of TNF-alpha on hemodynamic changes and circulating endothelium-derived vasoactive factors in dogs.
7943398|a|To elucidate the relation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced hemodynamic change to endothelium-derived vasoactive factors, we simultaneously measured hemodynamic parameters and circulating endothelin (ET)-1, ET-3, nitrite/nitrate (NOx), and 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) in anesthetized dogs following administration of TNF-alpha with or without NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA), a nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, and indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. Natural human TNF-alpha (10 micrograms/kg, n = 5) with or without L-NNA (1 mg/kg, n = 5) or indomethacin (2 mg/kg, n = 5) was administered intravenously as a bolus, while administration of vehicle served as control (n = 5). After administration of TNF-alpha, mean arterial pressure and cardiac index significantly decreased, whereas systemic (SVRI) and pulmonary (PVRI) vascular resistance index increased. Plasma levels of ET-1, ET-3, NOx, and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha significantly (P < 0.01) increased at 1 h. L-NNA or indomethacin blocked TNF-alpha-induced hypotension and remarkably increased SVRI but did not affect decreased cardiac index. Our data suggest that endogenous ET-1 may partly contribute to TNF-alpha-induced increases in SVRI and PVRI, against which ET-3, NO, and prostacyclin may function as compensatory vasodilators.

25834946|t|Novel first-dose adverse drug reactions during a phase I trial of olipudase alfa (recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase) in adults with Niemann-Pick disease type B (acid sphingomyelinase deficiency).
25834946|a|PURPOSE: Enzyme replacement therapy with olipudase alfa (recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase) is being developed for Niemann-Pick disease type B (NPD B). METHODS: A single-center, open-label, nonrandomized, single-ascending-dose trial evaluated the safety of intravenous olipudase alfa (0.03-1.0 mg/kg) in 11 adults with NPD B. Patients were monitored in the hospital for 72 h after infusion and had follow-up visits on days 14 and 28. RESULTS: Plasma ceramide, a product of sphingomyelin catabolism by olipudase alfa, showed dose-dependent elevations by 6 h postdose, or postinfusion. No serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) occurred during the study. Acute phase reaction-type ADRs, as evidenced by elevated inflammatory biomarkers (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-8, and calcitonin) and constitutional symptoms (fever, pain, nausea, and/or vomiting) emerged 12-24 h following doses ≥0.3 mg/kg olipudase alfa. Three patients experienced hyperbilirubinemia. The study was terminated after a patient dosed at 1 mg/kg exhibited severe hyperbilirubinemia; he was subsequently diagnosed with Gilbert syndrome. CONCLUSION: The maximum tolerated dose of olipudase alfa in adults with NPD B was 0.6 mg/kg. First-dose ADRs were likely induced by elevated concentrations of ceramide (or its downstream derivatives) generated by the catabolism of accumulated sphingomyelin. Within-patient dose escalation to slowly catabolize sphingomyelin stores may be a strategy to mitigate first-dose ADRs in patients with NPD B.Genet Med 18 1, 34-40.

23989918|t|Isocitric acid production from rapeseed oil by Yarrowia lipolytica yeast.
23989918|a|Production of D S-threo-isocitric acid (ICA) by yeast meets serious difficulties since it is accompanied by a simultaneous production of citric acid (CA) in significant amounts that reduces the yield of desired product. In order to develop an effective process of ICA production, 60 yeast strains of different genera (Candida, Pichia, Saccharomyces, Torulopsis, and Yarrowia) were tested for their ability to produce ICA from rapeseed oil; as a result, wild-type strain Yarrowia lipolytica VKM Y-2373 and its mutant Y. lipolytica 704-UV4-A/NG50 were selected as promising ICA producers. The effects of temperature, pH, aeration, and concentrations of rapeseed oil, iron, and itaconic acid on ICA production by selected strains were studied. Under optimal conditions (pH 6.0; aeration 50-55 %; rapeseed oil concentration of 20-60 gl(-1), iron ion concentration of 1.2 mg l(-1), and itaconic acid amount of 30 mM), selected strains of Y. lipolytica produced predominantly ICA with a low amount of a by-product, CA.

12384442|t|Phorbol ester stimulates a protein kinase C-mediated agatoxin-TK-sensitive calcium permeability pathway in human red blood cells.
12384442|a|Calcium entry into mature erythrocytes (red blood cells; RBCs) is associated with multiple changes in cell properties. At low intracellular Ca(2+), efflux of potassium and water predominates, leading to changes in erythrocyte rheology. At higher Ca(2+) content, activation of kinases and phosphatases, rupture of membrane-to-skeleton bridges, stimulation of a phospholipid scramblase and phospholipase C, and induction of transglutaminase-mediated protein cross-linking are also observed. Because the physiologic relevance of these latter responses depends partially on whether Ca(2+) entry involves a regulated channel or nonspecific leak, we explored mechanisms that initiate controlled Ca(2+) influx. Protein kinase C (PKC) was considered a prime candidate for the pathway regulator, and phorbol-12 myristate-13 acetate (PMA), a stimulator of PKC, was examined for its influence on erythrocyte Ca(2+). PMA was found to stimulate a rapid, dose-dependent influx of calcium, as demonstrated by the increased fluorescence of an entrapped Ca(2+)-sensitive dye, Fluo-3/AM. The PMA-induced entry was inhibited by staurosporine and the PKC-selective inhibitor chelerythrine chloride, but was activated by the phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and calyculin A. The PMA-promoted calcium influx was also inhibited by omega-agatoxin-TK, a calcium channel blocker specific for Ca(v)2.1 channels. To confirm that a Ca(v)2.1-like calcium channel exists in the mature erythrocyte membrane, RBC membrane preparations were immunoblotted with antiserum against the alpha(1A) subunit of the channel. A polypeptide of the expected molecular weight (190 kDa) was visualized. These studies indicate that an omega-agatoxin-TK-sensitive, Ca(v)2.1-like calcium permeability pathway is present in the RBC membrane and that it may function under the control of kinases and phosphatases.

9203362|t|Determination of nitrite and nitrate in human serum.
9203362|a|A simple and effective assay for nitrite and nitrate in human serum has been developed using ion chromatography. Initial experiments using isocratic carbonate-bicarbonate elution with conductivity detection on a Dionex QIC system with an AS4A-SC column showed promise but were unsatisfactory because of co-elution problems with nitrite. Carbonate and chloride were investigated as eluents using a gradient system, and direct UV detection at 214 nm was used in place of conductivity detection. Dionex AS4A, AS9A, AS12, Nucleopac PA-100 and Carbopac PA-100 columns were compared for selectivity and resistance to overload. The final method, using a chloride concentration gradient, pH buffering and direct UV detection with a Carbopac PA-100 column, shows good resolution, does not suffer from chloride overload and is simple to use. The method is being used in an investigation of the role of nitric oxide in pre-eclampsia, a hypertensive disorder during pregnancy.

22429397|t|Inhibition of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C results in loss of mesenchymal traits in metastatic breast cancer cells.
22429397|a|INTRODUCTION: Acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics confers to breast cancer (BC) cells the capability of invading tissues different from primary tumor site, allowing cell migration and metastasis. Regulators of the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) may represent targets for anticancer agents. Accruing evidence supports functional implications of choline phospholipid metabolism in oncogene-activated cell signaling and differentiation. We investigated the effects of D609, a xanthate inhibiting phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) and sphingomyelin synthase (SMS), as a candidate regulator of cell differentiation and MET in the highly metastatic BC cell line MDA-MB-231. METHODS: PC-PLC expression and activity were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), immunoblotting and enzymatic assay on human MDA-MB-231 compared with MCF-7 and SKBr3 BC cells and a nontumoral immortalized counterpart (MCF-10A). The effects of D609 on PC-PLC and SMS activity, loss of mesenchymal markers and changes in migration and invasion potential were monitored in MDA-MB-231 cells by enzymatic assays, CLSM, immunoblotting and transwell chamber invasion combined with scanning electron microscopy examinations. Cell proliferation, formation and composition of lipid bodies and cell morphology were investigated in D609-treated BC cells by cell count, CLSM, flow-cytometry of BODIPY-stained cells, nuclear magnetic resonance and thin-layer chromatography. RESULTS: PC-PLC (but not phospholipase D) showed 2- to 6-fold activation in BC compared with nontumoral cells, the highest activity (up to 0.4 pmol/μg protein/min) being detected in the poorly-differentiated MDA-MB-231 cells. Exposure of the latter cells to D609 (50 μg/mL, 24-72 h) resulted into 60-80% PC-PLC inhibition, while SMS was transiently inhibited by a maximum of 21%. These features were associated with progressive decreases of mesenchymal traits such as vimentin and N-cadherin expression, reduced galectin-3 and milk fat globule EGF-factor 8 levels, β-casein formation and decreased in vitro cell migration and invasion. Moreover, proliferation arrest, changes in cell morphology and formation of cytosolic lipid bodies typical of cell differentiation were induced by D609 in all investigated BC cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results support a critical involvement of PC-PLC in controlling molecular pathways responsible for maintaining a mesenchymal-like phenotype in metastatic BC cells and suggests PC-PLC deactivation as a means to promote BC cell differentiation and possibly enhance the effectiveness of antitumor treatments.

15092439|t|An analysis of nitrification during the aerobic digestion of secondary sludges.
15092439|a|Investigations were undertaken to study the occurrence and progress of nitrification during aerobic digestion of activated sludge in a wide range of initial concentrations of total solids (1000 to 80 000 mg litre(-1), initial pH range of 4.5 to 10.4 and digestion temperature range of 5 degrees to 60 degrees C. Batch aerobic digestion studies on activated sludge grown on wastewater (enriched with organic solids from human excretal material) indicate that almost complete elimination of the 'biodegradable' matter of the activated sludge was one of the essential prerequisites to initiate nitrification. Favourable ranges of temperature and pH for nitrification were observed to be 25 degrees to 30 degrees C and 6.0 to 8.3, respectively. With all favourable conditions, a minimum period of about 2 days was necessary for population build-up of genera Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter, and to initiate nitrification. Nitrate formation invariably lagged behind nitrite formation, but under certain conditions both phases of nitrification were observed to progress hand in hand.

8308034|t|Identification of the poly-L-proline-binding site on human profilin.
8308034|a|Profilin is a ubiquitous protein that has been implicated in the signaling pathway leading to cytoskeletal rearrangement in cells. An unusual property of profilin is its high binding affinity for poly-L-proline (PLP). This binding property is conserved in the profilins from diverse species with little sequence homology. We have monitored the binding of PLP to profilin by fluorescence and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies. NMR spectroscopy has identified several residues whose amide nitrogen and amide hydrogen chemical shifts are significantly perturbed by binding of PLP. The affected residues are located at various locations throughout profilin's primary structure; however, mapping the location of the affected residues onto the recently determined three-dimensional solution structure of human profilin indicates that the effects of PLP binding are highly localized. Poly-L-proline binds profilin at the hydrophobic interface between profilin's NH2- and COOH-terminal helices and the upper face of its antiparallel beta-sheet. In contrast, residues located on the opposite side of the profilin structure are unaffected. The extent of the potential interaction surface of the PLP-profilin complex suggests that as few as 6 contiguous prolines would be sufficient for binding profilin. Examination of sequence data bases indicates that stretches of prolines of this length and longer occur in numerous regulatory proteins, suggesting that the ability of profilin to bind polyproline may be an important component of its signaling capabilities.

26051044|t|New forms of insulin and insulin therapies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
26051044|a|Insulin is a common treatment option for many patients with type 2 diabetes, and is generally used late in the natural history of the disease. Its injectable delivery mode, propensity for weight gain and hypoglycaemia, and the paucity of trials assessing the risk-to-safety ratio of early insulin use are major shortcomings associated with its use in patients with type 2 diabetes. Development of new insulins-such as insulin analogues, including long-acting and short-acting insulins-now provide alternative treatment options to human insulin. These novel insulin formulations and innovative insulin delivery methods, such as oral or inhaled insulin, have been developed with the aim to reduce insulin-associated hypoglycaemia, lower intraindividual pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability, and improve imitation of physiological insulin release. Availability of newer glucose-lowering drugs (such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors) also offers the opportunity for combination treatment; the results of the first trials in this area of research suggest that such treatment might lead to use of reduced insulin doses, less weight gain, and fewer hypoglycaemic episodes than insulin treatment alone. These and future developments will hopefully offer better opportunities for individualisation of insulin treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes.

8222268|t|Characteristics of membrane-bound 5'-nucleotidase on human prostasomes.
8222268|a|Examination of prostasomes, isolated from human seminal plasma, showed that there was very little remaining paranitrophenylphosphatase activity when assayed in the presence of 10 mmol/l of tartrate and 2 mmol/l of levamisole. Under these conditions it was possible to study the prostasome membrane-bound 5'-nucleotidase activity, which was unaffected by these two inhibitors. The activity was considered to be located at the external surface of the prostasome membrane and a 50-60% increase in activity was obtained by the addition of 0.05% Triton X-100. The prostasome membrane-linked 5'-nucleotidase readily hydrolysed 5'-AMP. Two other 5'-nucleoside monophosphates, 5'-IMP and 5'-GMP, were also hydrolysed, but more slowly; 2'- or 3'-AMP were practically not attacked. The prostasome membrane-linked 5'-nucleotidase obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Apparent Km for 5'-AMP was 11.2 +/- 2.1 mumol/l and Vmax 64.7 +/- 11.4 nmol/mg protein/min. These figures were somewhat changed in presence of 0.05% Triton X-100, the Km value being reduced by 30% and the Vmax value increased by 60%. Adenosine 5' (alpha, beta methylene) diphosphate (100 mumol/l), Ni2+ (10 mmol/l) and concanavalin A (20 micrograms/ml) were all potent inhibitors of the prostasome membrane-linked 5'-nucleotidase.

7155173|t|Genuine myotubular myopathy.
7155173|a|Two patients, a father and his 14-year-old son, were suffering from a facioperoneal syndrome, and muscle biopsy findings were consistent with a myotubular myopathy. The father exhibited central nuclei in most muscle fibers, but his son had typical changes exclusively in hypotrophic type I fibers. The cytochemical and ultrastructural analysis revealed a spectrum of pathological changes typical of myotubular myopathy. Energy-dispersive electron probe x-ray microanalysis was performed on 6- to 12-microns thick freeze-dried cryosections visualized in the scanning or scanning transmission mode of electron microscopy. We found a high intracellular sodium and chlorine concentration and a low potassium concentration in comparison with control muscles. These changes pointed in the direction similar to results from human fetal muscle. The changes in the intracellular elemental composition may indicate a membrane pump dysfunction, which might be caused by a partial arrest in muscle fiber maturation.

7519215|t|Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes lack detectable nitric oxide synthase activity.
7519215|a|Nitric oxide regulates polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) function, but whether or not human PMNs express nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity is controversial. We studied NOS activity in human PMNs by using human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) for comparison. The conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline, a relatively specific measure of NOS activity, was easily measured and inducible in fractionated HAECs, and > 90% of all L-arginine conversion was blocked by the NOS inhibitor, N omega-amino-L-arginine (L-NAA). In fractionated PMNs, L-arginine conversion was low and was unaffected by L-NAA. In addition, NOS activity was not induced in PMNs by LPS, IL-1 beta, or IFN-gamma. In a whole-cell assay, total L-arginine conversion was much lower in human PMNs compared with HAECs (3.38 +/- 0.21 vs 157.5 +/- 10.28 pmol/h/10(6) cells, respectively; p < 0.01). This conversion in whole PMNs was not increased in vitro by LPS, IFN-gamma, IL-1 beta, or TNF-alpha nor decreased by W13, a calmodulin inhibitor. Furthermore, PMNs isolated from four volunteers before and after challenge with i.v. LPS (4 ng/kg) showed no increase in L-arginine to L-citrulline conversion. Nitrite and nitrate release from human PMNs was 35-fold lower than for HAECs and was not inhibited by L-NAA. These data suggest that human PMNs do not express NOS activity.

15159406|t|Directed evolution of human estrogen receptor variants with significantly enhanced androgen specificity and affinity.
15159406|a|Human estrogen receptor alpha (hERalpha) and human androgen receptor exhibit exquisite ligand specificity, which underlies their remarkable ability to effect ligand-regulated gene transcription in a highly distinctive and specific manner. Here we used a directed evolution approach to create hERalpha variants with enhanced androgen specificity and affinity with the goal to better understand the molecular basis of ER ligand specificity and the evolutionary mechanism of nuclear receptors. We developed a sensitive yeast two-hybrid system to screen for hERalpha variants with increased transactivation potency toward testosterone. After two rounds of directed evolution, we identified five hERalpha variants with dramatically improved transactivation potency toward testosterone in both yeast and mammalian cells. These variants showed up to 7,600-fold improvement in the binding affinity for testosterone and only slightly reduced affinity toward 17beta-estradiol. Detailed analysis of these evolved variants and a few site-directed mutants generated de novo led to several unexpected findings including the following. 1) Only two beneficial mutations were needed to create hERalpha variants with near nanomolar affinity for testosterone. 2) Some beneficial mutations were synergistic, context-dependent, or non-additive. 3) Of the five identified beneficial mutations, four of them were not in the ER ligand binding pocket and yet exerted important action on ligand specificity. 4) The single ligand-contacting mutation E353Q plays a dominant role in discriminating androgens and estrogens. These results, viewed in conjunction with the ligand exploitation model of nuclear receptor evolution, suggest that the mutation E353Q may represent a key event in the evolution of androgen receptors from an ancestral estrogen receptor and that ligand promiscuity may play an important role in the creation of new nuclear receptors via divergent evolution.

9100353|t|Immobilization on chitosan of a thermophilic beta-glycosidase expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
9100353|a|A Sulfolobus solfataricus beta-glycosidase expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S beta gly) was immobilized on chitosan activated with glutaraldehyde. The yield of immobilization was evaluated as 80%. Compared to the free beta-glycosidase, the immobilized enzyme showed a similar pH optimum (pH = 7.0), the same increasing activity up to 80 degrees C, improved thermostability, and no inhibition by glucose. Functional studies pointed out that the kinetic constant values for both enzymes were comparable. A bioreactor, assembled with the immobilized S beta gly, was used for glucose production. The values of cellobiose conversion increased on increasing residence time in the bioreactor, following a nonlinear trend. However, the highest glucose production/min was obtained at a flow of 0.5 mL/min.

7565624|t|Comparison of the pharmacology and signal transduction of the human cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors.
7565624|a|The recently cloned CB2 cannabinoid receptor subtype was stably transfected into AtT-20 and Chinese hamster ovary cells to compare the binding and signal transduction properties of this receptor with those of the CB1 receptor subtype. The binding of [3H]CP 55,940 to both CB1 and CB2 was of similar high affinity (2.6 and 3.7 nM, respectively) and saturable. In competitive binding experiments, (-)-delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol and CP 55,940 were equipotent at the CB1 and CB2 receptors, but WIN 55212-2 and cannabinol bound with higher affinity to the CB2 than the CB1 receptor. HU 210 had a higher affinity for the CB1 receptor. Anandamide, a recently identified endogenous cannabinoid agonist, was essentially equipotent at both receptor subtypes. The structurally related fatty acid ethanolamides dihomo-gamma-linolenylethanolamide and mead ethanolamide also bound with relatively equal affinity to both receptors, but adrenylethanolamide had a higher affinity for the CB1 receptor. The rank order of potency and efficacy for binding of the selected agonists to the CB1 and CB2 receptors was mimicked in functional inhibition of cAMP accumulation experiments for all compounds tested. Both CB1 and CB2 receptors couple to the inhibition of cAMP accumulation that was pertussis toxin sensitive. SR141716A, a CB1 receptor antagonist, was a poor antagonist at the CB2 receptor in both binding and functional inhibition of cAMP accumulation experiments. When expressed in AtT-20 cells, the CB1 receptor mediated an inhibition of Q-type calcium channels and an activation of inward rectifying potassium channels. In contrast, the CB2 receptor did not modulate the activity of either channel under identical assay conditions. Similar to results obtained for CB1 receptor, the CB2 receptor did not couple to the activation of phospholipases A2, C, or D or to the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. Except for its inability to couple to the modulation of Q-type calcium channels or inwardly rectifying potassium channels, the CB1 and CB2 receptors display similar pharmacological and biochemical properties.

9462711|t|Modulation of galectin-1 content in human head and neck squamous carcinoma cells by sodium butyrate.
9462711|a|Galectin-1 and galectin-3 are beta-galactoside-binding proteins thought to be important for cellular interactions, growth regulation and differentiation. Alterations in cellular content of galectins have been associated with differentiation, transformation and malignant progression. We examined the modulation of galectin-1 and galectin-3 expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines by treatment with sodium butyrate, a known differentiation-modulating agent, and identified potential mechanisms of butyrate regulation of galectin-1 levels in one of the cell lines. Sodium butyrate effected an increase in galectin-1 protein concentration in 5 of 8 cell lines. One cell line, MDA-886LN, showed a marked time- and dose-dependent increase from barely detectable amounts with butyrate treatment. Concurrently with increased galectin-1 expression, butyrate treatment promoted morphologic changes, induced growth inhibition and inhibited soft agar colony formation in MDA-886LN cells. Butyrate-treated MDA-886LN cells demonstrated increased galectin-1 mRNA content, suggesting a role for butyrate in transcriptional regulation of galectin-1 expression. Treatment with other inhibitors of histone deacetylase also induced an increase in galectin-1 expression. Together, our results indicate that butyrate treatment can modulate galectin-1 content in MDA-886LN HNSCC cells as well as induce morphologic changes and growth inhibition. This action may involve a combination of transcriptional regulation and inhibition of histone deacetylation.

6546185|t|The effects of hydrogen-ion concentration on the respiratory efficiency of human liver mitochondria.
6546185|a|To examine the effects of hydrogen ion concentrations on the coupled respirations of isolated human liver mitochondria, eight patients underwent incidental liver biopsies during the conduct of abdominal surgery. Mitochondria were studied by the polarographic technique at pH of 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0. Results indicated severe inhibition of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-linked substrates but succinate oxidations were minimally affected. Sodium succinate was then studied as a possible substrate in the resuscitation of hemorrhagic shock. Rats were subjected to bleeding to an arterial blood pressure of 50 mm Hg for 3 hours or until 25 per cent of shed blood had to be reinfused to maintain blood pressure. Resuscitation consisted of reinfusion of all shed blood plus a volume of one of four crystalloid regimens: Ringers lactate; isotonic sodium succinate; hypertonic sodium chloride (190 mEq/l): or twice-normal, hypertonic sodium chloride (308 mEq/l). Results indicated that those rats resuscitated with sodium succinate did poorer than animals receiving alternate regimens. The failure of succinate to diffuse across the plasma membrane may explain these data. Additional studies with succinate or a chemical analogue seem warranted.

11009570|t|Phosphate regulation of vascular smooth muscle cell calcification.
11009570|a|Vascular calcification is a common finding in atherosclerosis and a serious problem in diabetic and uremic patients. Because of the correlation of hyperphosphatemia and vascular calcification, the ability of extracellular inorganic phosphate levels to regulate human aortic smooth muscle cell (HSMC) culture mineralization in vitro was examined. HSMCs cultured in media containing normal physiological levels of inorganic phosphate (1.4 mmol/L) did not mineralize. In contrast, HSMCs cultured in media containing phosphate levels comparable to those seen in hyperphosphatemic individuals (>1.4 mmol/L) showed dose-dependent increases in mineral deposition. Mechanistic studies revealed that elevated phosphate treatment of HSMCs also enhanced the expression of the osteoblastic differentiation markers osteocalcin and Cbfa-1. The effects of elevated phosphate on HSMCs were mediated by a sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter (NPC), as indicated by the ability of the specific NPC inhibitor phosphonoformic acid, to dose dependently inhibit phosphate-induced calcium deposition as well as osteocalcin and Cbfa-1 gene expression. With the use of polymerase chain reaction and Northern blot analyses, the NPC in HSMCs was identified as Pit-1 (Glvr-1), a member of the novel type III NPCs. These data suggest that elevated phosphate may directly stimulate HSMCs to undergo phenotypic changes that predispose to calcification and offer a novel explanation of the phenomenon of vascular calcification under hyperphosphatemic conditions.

10906435|a|The influence of ethanol and acetaldehyde on DNA in human lymphocytes, gastric mucosa (GM) and colonic mucosa (CM) was investigated by using the comet assay. All kinds of cells were exposed to ethanol and acetaldehyde in two regimens: the cells were incubated with either chemical and analysed or they were exposed first to ethanol, washed and then exposed to acetaldehyde and analysed. Lymphocytes were exposed to ethanol at final concentrations of 30 mM and acetaldehyde at 3 mM. GM cells were incubated with ethanol at 1 M and acetaldehyde at 100 mM. CM cells were exposed to ethanol at 10 mM and acetaldehyde at 100 mM. In combined exposure, the cells were subsequently exposed to ethanol and acetaldehyde at all combination of the concentrations of the agents. Ethanol caused DNA strand breaks, which were repaired during 4 hr, except when this agent was applied in GM cells at a concentration of 1 M. A dose-dependent decrease in the tail moment of all types of acetaldehyde-treated cells was observed. Similar results were obtained when a recognized DNA crosslinking agent, formaldehyde, was used. These results suggest that acetaldehyde may form crosslinks with DNA. These crosslinks were poorly repaired. CM cells showed the highest sensitivity of all cell types to ethanol than lymphocytes and GM cells. There were no differences in the sensitivity to acetaldehyde of all the cell types. Our results clearly indicate that ethanol and acetaldehyde can contribute to cancers of the digestive tract.

12393545|t|HK Utrecht: missense mutation in the active site of human hexokinase associated with hexokinase deficiency and severe nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia.
12393545|a|Hexokinase deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disease with a clinical phenotype of severe hemolysis. We report a novel homozygous missense mutation in exon 15 (c.2039C>G, HK [hexokinase] Utrecht) of HK1, the gene that encodes red blood cell-specific hexokinase-R, in a patient previously diagnosed with hexokinase deficiency. The Thr680Ser substitution predicted by this mutation affects a highly conserved residue in the enzyme's active site that interacts with phosphate moieties of adenosine diphosphate, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and inhibitor glucose-6-phosphate. We correlated the molecular data to the severe clinical phenotype of the patient by means of altered enzymatic properties of partially purified hexokinase from the patient, notably with respect to Mg(2+)-ATP binding. These kinetic properties contradict those obtained from a recombinant mutant brain hexokinase-I with the same Thr680Ser substitution. This contradiction thereby stresses the valuable contribution of studying patients with hexokinase deficiency to achieve a better understanding of hexokinase's key role in glycolysis.

19084665|t|Electrochemistry and chemiluminescence techniques compared in the detection of NADPH oxidase activity in phagocyte cells.
19084665|a|Several methodologies have been used in clinical chemistry for real-time assessment of NADPH oxidase primary product superoxide anion which dismutases to hydrogen peroxide. Among these methodologies, isoluminol chemiluminescence (CL) is considered to be one of the more sensitive and reliable techniques for the assessment of NADPH oxidase activity in neutrophils. The electrochemical technique was recently designed and also applied for real-time detection of NADPH oxidase activity in neutrophils but its reliability and sensitivity has not been investigated so far. In this study, isoluminol CL and electrochemical techniques were investigated and compared by monitoring the generation of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide in both PLB 985 cell line differentiated into neutrophil-like cells and human neutrophils. The electrochemical technique was shown to be as sensitive as that of CL and able to detect the reactive oxygen species (ROS) release of as low as 500 cells. Thus, the electrochemical technique could be used as an alternative to optical techniques for the evaluation of extracellular ROS in phagocyte cells.

14569057|t|Roles of catalase and hydrogen peroxide in green tea polyphenol-induced chemopreventive effects.
14569057|a|The green tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) possesses promising anticancer potential. Although in vivo studies unveiled the metabolic routes and pharmacokinetics of EGCG and showed no adverse effects, in vitro studies at high concentrations demonstrated oxidative stress. EGCG causes differential oxidative environments in tumor versus normal epithelial cells, but the roles that EGCG, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and intracellular catalase play in the epithelial system are largely unknown. The current study employed enzyme activity assays, reactive oxygen species quantification, and immunoblotting to investigate whether EGCG-induced differential effects correlate with levels of key antioxidant enzymes and H2O2. It was found that normal human keratinocytes with high catalase activity are least susceptible to H2O2, whereas H2O2 caused significant cytotoxicity in oral carcinoma cell lines. However, the EGCG-induced differential effects could not be duplicated by H2O2 alone. The addition of exogenous catalase failed to completely prevent the EGCG-induced cytotoxicity and rescue the EGCG-induced growth arrest in the tumor cells. The antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine rescued the tumor cells from H2O2-induced damage only, but not from EGCG-induced mitochondrial damage. Finally, alterations in catalase or superoxide dismutase activities were not observed upon EGCG exposure. In conclusion, although endogenous catalase may play a role in response to H2O2-induced cytotoxicity, the EGCG-induced cytotoxic effects on tumor cells mainly result from sources other than H2O2.

8473009|t|Interferon-gamma-activated monocytes impair infectivity of HIV particles by an oxygen metabolite-dependent reaction.
8473009|a|Mononuclear phagocytes generate microbicidal oxygen metabolites spontaneously and after phagocytic stimulation by a NADPH-dependent enzymatic reaction called the oxidative burst. The spontaneous release of reactive oxygen radicals and intermediates (ROI) increases five- to eightfold after treatment of monocytes with the lymphokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). The effect of the IFN-gamma-activated release of ROI by human monocytes on the infectivity of free human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the supernatant was investigated with the following results. First, IFN-gamma-activated, but neither control monocytes nor lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocytes effectively decreased the infectivity of cell-free HIV-1 in culture medium supernatant. Second, the mechanism of inactivation was dependent on the enhanced spontaneous release of ROI by IFN-gamma-activated mononuclear phagocytes, since either the enzyme catalase or the free radical scavenger butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) could block this activity. Third, soluble and solid-phase HIV-1 outer envelope glycoprotein (gp120) failed to trigger the oxidative burst activity after specific gp120-monocytic CD4 receptor interaction. These results indicate an anti-viral effect of IFN-gamma-activated monocytes/macrophages on HIV-1 which may have important implications for our understanding of spread of the virus in the body and the development of full-blown AIDS after a long period of latency.

17978559|t|[Mechanism of DNA damage and apoptosis induced by anticancer drugs through generation of reactive oxygen species].
17978559|a|A number of anticancer drugs exert their effect by causing DNA damage and subsequent apoptosis induction. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and super oxide anion (O(2)(-)), participate in apoptosis and DNA damage induced by some anticancer drugs, however, the precise mechanism of apoptosis via ROS formation remains to be clarified. I investigated the mechanism of apoptosis and DNA damage induced by anticancer drugs, especially topoisomerase inhibitors, using human cultured cells. TAS-103, a topoisomerase inhibitor, induces apoptosis through DNA cleavage and subsequent H(2)O(2) generation mediated by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and NAD(P)H oxidase activation. Doxorubicin (DOX), an anthracycline antibiotic and topoisomerase inhibitor, induces apoptosis through direct oxidative DNA damage leading to indirect H(2)O(2) generation mediated by PARP and NAD(P)H oxidase activation. DOX caused site-specific oxidative DNA damage in the presence of copper(II), which may contribute to apoptosis. These findings suggest that ROS formation plays important roles in apoptosis induced by anticancer drugs. Furthermore, these studies may provide an insight into the development of new effective chemotherapeutic drugs.

21577274|t|Contribution of cholesterol and oxysterols in the physiopathology of cataract: implication for the development of pharmacological treatments.
21577274|a|The development of cataract is associated with some lipid changes in human lens fibers, especially with increased accumulation and redistribution of cholesterol inside these cells. Some direct and indirect lines of evidence, also suggest an involvement of cholesterol oxide derivatives (also named oxysterols) in the development of cataract. Oxysterol formation can result either from nonenzymatic or enzymatic processes, and some oxysterols can induce a wide range of cytotoxic effects (overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS); phospholipidosis) which might contribute to the initiation and progression of cataract. Thus, the conception of molecules capable of regulating cholesterol homeostasia and oxysterol levels in human lens fibers can have some interests and constitute an alternative to surgery at least at early stages of the disease.

12164310|t|Sarcoplasmic reticulum function and contractile consequences in ureteric smooth muscles.
12164310|a|This paper discusses the role of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-induced Ca2+ release (IICR) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in the control of contractile activity in the ureter. The Ca2+ store in guinea-pig ureter has been found to be exclusively a CICR type with ryanodine receptors (RyRs) present. In the rat ureter the SR store is exclusively an IICR type with InsP3 receptors (InsP3Rs) present. Guinea-pig ureteric cells in vitro and in situ have been found to generate Ca2+ sparks--small localized, transient releases from RyRs. The sparks are enhanced by caffeine and blocked by emptying the SR. In rat cells Ca2+ puffs occur in response to agonists, representing the opening of InsP3Rs. The puffs can be abolished by heparin or store emptying. These SR Ca2+-release events affect the excitability of the ureteric cells. In guinea-pig cells, spontaneous transient outward currents (STOCs) can be recorded in response to caffeine application (an agonist for RyR), followed by a shortening of the plateau phase of the action potential. This in turn causes a decrease in the amplitude and duration of the contractions of the ureter. If the SR is inhibited then STOCs are abolished, the action potential plateau prolonged and force increased. Thus it is concluded that the SR acts to limit contraction in the guinea-pig ureter. The mechanism underlying this involves its Ca2+ release being directed to Ca2+-activated K+ channels on the surface membrane and causing STOCs and hyperpolarization, and controlling the duration of the action potential. In rat ureter IICR acts to potentiate force via membrane depolarization and increased L-type Ca2+ entry into the cells. Thus the SR can alter cell signalling and excitation-contraction coupling in the ureter, but its precise role is species dependent. The ureter, with its species-dependent expression of either IICR or CICR provides an ideal system (a natural transgenic model) for studying the SR. Eventually, we will be able to apply this knowledge to the human ureter, to increase our understanding of its functioning in health and disease.

27581686|t|Isolation and functional characterization of an ammonium transporter gene, PyAMT1, related to nitrogen assimilation in the marine macroalga Pyropia yezoensis (Rhodophyta).
27581686|a|Ammonium and nitrate are the primary nitrogen sources in natural environments, and are essential for growth and development in photosynthetic eukaryotes. In this study, we report on the isolation and characterization of an ammonium transporter gene (PyAMT1) which performs a key function in nitrogen (N) metabolism of Pyropia yezoensis thalli. The predicted length of PyAMT1 was 483 amino acids (AAs). The AA sequence included 11 putative transmembrane domains and showed approximately 33-44% identity to algal and plant AMT1 AA sequences. Functional complementation in an AMT-defective yeast mutant indicated that PyAMT1 mediated ammonium transport across the plasma membrane. Expression analysis showed that the PyAMT1 mRNA level was strongly induced by N-deficiency, and was more highly suppressed by resupply of inorganic-N than organic-N. These results suggest that PyAMT1 plays important roles in the ammonium transport system, and is highly regulated in response to external/internal N-status.

6098672|t|Measurement of receptor induced changes in intracellular free calcium in human platelets.
6098672|a|The intracellular free calcium concentration plays a key role as second messenger in the regulation of cellular reactions. Post-receptor events can be investigated by measurement of free calcium concentration in cells. Our experience in measuring the intracellular free calcium concentration in platelets with the use of the fluorescent indicator quin-2-tetraacetoxymethyl- ester is described. Possible pitfalls in the preparation procedures of the platelets are discussed as well as critical steps and the limitations of the quin-2-method. The methodological approach is demonstrated by the presentation of an investigation with the adenylate cyclase inhibitors adenosine-5'-diphosphate and epinephrine as well as their interrelationship. The potentiation effect of epinephrine to adenosine 5'-diphosphate on platelet function such as aggregation is accompanied by a potentiation of the effect of these two platelet activators in elevating the intracellular free calcium concentration. Adenosine 5'-diphosphate elevates intra-platelet free calcium alone, whereas epinephrine acting through stimulation of the alpha2-receptor needs another permissive factor to immediately elevate the intra-platelet free calcium.

20832460|t|UVA-induced cyototoxicity and DNA damaging potential of benz (e) acephenanthrylene.
20832460|a|The toxicity of benz (e) acephenanthrylene (BeA) has been studied earlier with regard to the carcinogenicity of its metabolites, but its phototogenotoxicity is not well understood. Present study aimed to analyze the photodynamic response of BeA in human skin cell line (A375) under ambient environmental intensity of UVA (1.40 mW/cm(2)). Kinetic of BeA showed that the highest intracellular uptake of BeA occurred after 24h of incubation. Cell viability, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative stress and DNA damage induced by BeA under UVA irradiation were assessed. BeA generates singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)), superoxide anion radical (O(2)(ⁱ-)) and hydroxyl radical (ⁱOH) in a concentration-dependent manner. It was observed that glutathione reduced (GSH) and catalase activity were decreased while DNA damage and cell death were induced significantly (P>0.01) as concentration of BeA increased. Thus our results suggest that BeA may be phototoxic as well as photogenotoxic under UVA irradiation.

18971634|t|Newly identified ADAR-mediated A-to-I editing positions as a tool for ALS research.
18971634|a|Among the extensively occurring adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) conversions in RNA, RNA editing at the GluR2 Q/R site is crucial for the survival of mammalian organisms. Editing at this site is incomplete in the motor neurons of patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA type 2 (ADAR2) specifically mediates GluR2 Q/R site-editing, hence, it is likely a molecule relevant to the pathogenesis of sporadic ALS. Since no other transcript with ADAR2-mediated A-to-I positions is abundantly expressed in most neurons, the editors at the newly identified A-to-I positions were investigated. CYFIP2 and FLNA mRNAs were identified together with mRNAs having known ADAR2-mediated editing positions in ADAR2-immunoprecipitates of the human cerebellum, indicating that these mRNAs probably possessed ADAR2-mediated positions. Furthermore, an in vitro RNAi knockdown system demonstrated that the CYFIP2 mRNA K/E site and the BLCAP mRNA Y/C site were edited predominantly by ADAR2 and ADAR1, respectively. CYFIP2 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed and particularly abundant in the central nervous system. The extent of CYFIP2 K/E site-editing was between 30% and 80% in the central nervous system. Therefore, the extent of CYFIP2 K/E site-editing may be an additional marker for ADAR2 activity in neuronal and other types of cells in vivo, as well as in vitro, and thus is considered to be a good tool for sporadic ALS research.

8865430|t|International consensus on the standardization of sodium and potassium measurements by ion-selective electrodes in undiluted samples.
8865430|a|The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) and the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) are about to recommend to adjust sodium and potassium measurements by ion-selective electrodes in undiluted samples to the amount of substance concentration in the sample as determined, e.g., by flame atomic emission spectrometry. The adjustment is only valid in case of normal standardized sera (or plasma), implying "normal" water concentration (normal concentration of proteins, lipids or other macromolecules), "normal" binding of the pertinent electrolytes and "normal" coefficient of activity. If these criteria are not met, results obtained by "adjusted" ISE's will differ from total molar concentration. That is: in individual samples of patients results from ISE's and total molar concentration will differ unpredictably. It forced IFCC to propose new quantities for the measurements by adjusted ISE's: ionized sodium and ionized potassium. The reference interval for ionized sodium and ionized potassium is identical to the pertinent reference interval for molar concentration of total sodium and total potassium, but it is in contrast independent from water concentration and valid, e.g., in hypoproteinaemia as well as in hyperlipaemia or hyperproteinaemia. Accuracy control of ionized sodium and ionized potassium based on reference method values is hampered by abnormal water concentration and inadequate properties of the matrix of many control sera. Alternative approaches how to report measurements by ISE's in undiluted samples, such as activity or free molal concentration are discussed with their pros and cons regarding accuracy control by reference method values. The need for appropriate control materials with a matrix similar to native human sera is stressed.

3282809|t|Bone mineral metabolism in human type 1 (insulin dependent) diabetes mellitus.
3282809|a|Decreased bone mineral content has been observed in several studies of type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetics in comparison with age and sex matched control subjects. In type 2 diabetics contradictory results have been obtained, probably related to varying degrees of body overweight in the patients investigated. The decrease in bone mineral content in type 1 diabetics was most pronounced in patients with childhood or adolescent onset of the disease, with ceased beta-cell function, with high insulin dosage, and poor glucose regulation. In a subgroup of patients having all these "risk factors" bone mineral content was decreased some 20%, as compared with patients without any "risk factors", and/or with sex and age matched controls. Bone mineral homeostasis was characterized by increased urinary excretions of bone minerals (calcium, phosphate and magnesium) related to the degree of hyperglycaemia and insulin dosage, by decreased serum concentrations of ionized calcium and magnesium, by increased to normal serum concentrations of phosphate, by a low-normal serum concentration of parathyroid hormone, and by a low-normal serum concentration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. This indicates a state of functional hypoparathyroidism in type 1 diabetics. Several mechanisms may thus contribute to diabetic osteopenia: Proneness to metabolic acidosis, hypocalcaemia, insulin deficiency and perhaps also hypomagnesaemia and hypoparathyroidism.

14664711|t|Cytokines and nitric oxide inhibit the enzyme activity of catalase but not its protein or mRNA expression in insulin-producing cells.
14664711|a|Pancreatic beta-cells have low activities of the antioxidant enzyme catalase. Nitric oxide interacts with the haem group of catalase inhibiting its activity. We have studied the activity of catalase in beta-cells under conditions mimicking prediabetes and in which nitric oxide is generated from cytokine treatment in vitro. We also studied whether there is regulation of catalase enzyme activity by nitric oxide at the protein or gene expression level. RINm5F insulin-producing cells, treated for 24 h with cytokines, showed increased medium nitrite production (17+/-2.2 vs 0.3+/-0.2 pmol/ micro g protein) and significantly decreased cellular catalase activity (42.4+/-4.5%) compared with control cells. A similar reduction was seen in catalase-overexpressing RIN-CAT cells and in rat or human pancreatic islets of Langerhans. Catalase activity was also suppressed by the long-acting nitric oxide donor diethylenetriamine/nitric oxide adduct (Deta-NO) and this inhibition was reversible. The inhibition of catalase activity by cytokines in RINm5F cells was significantly reversed by the addition of the nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) inhibitors nitro monomethylarginine or N-(3-(aminomethyl)benzyl)acetamidine (1400W). Protein expression was found to be unchanged in cytokine- or Deta-NO-treated RINm5F cells, while mRNA expression was marginally increased. We have shown that inhibition of catalase activity by cytokines is nitric oxide dependent and propose that this inhibition may confer increased susceptibility to cytokine- or nitric oxide-induced cell killing.

8299892|t|Aldolase B and fructose intolerance.
8299892|a|Hereditary fructose intolerance is an autosomal recessive disorder that illustrates vividly the interplay between heredity and environment in the genesis of human nutritional disease. Genetically determined defects of an isozyme of fructose bisphosphate aldolase (aldolase B, which is specialized for the metabolic assimilation of dietary sugars) predispose to this widely distributed condition. Ingestion of fructose, sorbitol, or sucrose induces abdominal pain, vomiting, and metabolic disturbances--including low concentrations of blood glucose--that may prove fatal. The response to dietary exclusion is rapid and, when so treated, the disease is compatible with a normal life span. A noteworthy feature of the condition in individuals who survive the stormy period of weaning is the development of powerful aversions to fruit, nuts, and sweet-tasting foods and drinks. The incidence of dental caries is consequently much reduced.

15268976|t|Protective effect of Ligusticum chuanxiong and Angelica sinensis on endothelial cell damage induced by hydrogen peroxide.
15268976|a|Ligusticum chuanxiong and Angelica sinensis have been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat some pathological settings such as atherosclerosis and hypertension. We determined the protective effect of the extract of Ligusticum chuanxiong and Angelica sinensis (ELCAS) on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECV304) damage induced by hydrogen peroxide. ECV304 cells were pre-treated with ELCAS and exposed to 5 mM hydrogen peroxide. The results show that ELCAS dose- and time-dependently protected ECV304 cells against hydrogen peroxide damage and suppressed the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The decrement of ROS may be associated with increased activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX). Western blot analysis revealed that ELCAS significantly increased the phosphorylation of ERK and promoted eNOS expression. These observations indicate that ELCAS protected ECV304 cells against hydrogen peroxide damage by enhancing the antioxidative ability, activating ERK and eNOS signaling pathway. Our data also provide new evidence of Ligusticum chuanxiong and Angelica sinensis in preventing both cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.

9182988|t|NADH oxidase activity of human xanthine oxidoreductase--generation of superoxide anion.
9182988|a|Human xanthine oxidase was purified from breast milk. The dehydrogenase form of the enzyme, which predominates in most mammalian tissues, catalyses the oxidation of NADH by oxygen, generating superoxide anion significantly faster than does the oxidase form. The corresponding forms of bovine enzyme behave very similarly. The steady-state kinetics of NADH oxidation and superoxide production, including inhibition by NAD, by the dehydrogenase forms of both enzymes, are analysed in terms of a model involving two-stage recycling of oxidised enzyme. Established inhibitors of xanthine oxidoreductases (allopurinol oxypurinol, amflutizole and BOF 4272), which block all other reducing substrates, were ineffective in the case of NADH. Diphenyleneiodonium, on the other hand, was a powerful inhibitor of NADH oxidation. The potential involvement of reactive oxygen species arising from NADH oxidation by xanthine oxidoreductase in ischaemia-reperfusion injury and other disease states, as well as in normal signal transduction, is discusssed.

Here we investigated the protective effects of delphinidin against oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-induced damage in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The MTT assay showed that 2h pre-incubation with delphinidin markedly restored the oxLDL-induced viability loss in HUVECs in a concentration-dependent manner. This effect was accompanied by a significant decrease in intracellular reactive oxygen species. Moreover, delphinidin imposed preventive effects on suppressing the production of lipid peroxidation, restoring the activities of endogenous antioxidants, and increasing the level of nitric oxide. Pre-incubation of delphinidin with HUVECs led to the reduction of apoptosis. Finally, delphinidin can efficiently prevent the down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein and up-regulation of Bax protein. Together, our findings suggest that delphinidin can effectively protect HUVECs against oxidative stress induced by oxLDL, which may be important for preventing both plaque development and stability in atherosclerosis.

14631141|t|Dependence of Plasmodium falciparum in vitro growth on the cation permeability of the human host erythrocyte.
14631141|a|Intraerythrocyte growth of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum induces a Ca2+-permeable unselective cation conductance in the host cell membrane which is inhibited by ethylisopropylamiloride (EIPA) and is paralleled by an exchange of K+ by Na+ in the host cytosol. The present study has been performed to elucidate the functional significance of the electrolyte exchange. Whole-cell patch-clamp experiments confirmed the Ca2+ permeability and EIPA sensitivity of the Plasmodium falciparum induced cation channel. In further experiments, ring stage-synchronized parasites were grown in vitro for 48 h in different test media. Percentage of Plasmodium-infected and phosphatidylserine-exposing erythrocytes was measured with FACS analysis by staining with the DNA-dye Syto16 and annexin V, respectively. The increase of infected cells was not significantly affected by an 8 h replacement of NaCl in the culture medium with Na-gluconate but was significantly blunted by replacement of NaCl with KCl, NMDG-Cl or raffinose. Half maximal growth was observed at about 25 mM Na+. The increase of infected cells was further inhibited by EIPA (IC50< 10 microM) and at low extracellular free Ca2+. Infected cells displayed significantly stronger annexin binding, an effect mimicked by exposure of noninfected erythrocytes to oxidative stress (1 mM T-butylhydroperoxide for 15 min) or to Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin (1 microM for 60 min). The observations indicate that parasite growth requires the entry of both, Na+ and Ca2+ cations into the host erythrocyte probably through the EIPA sensitive cation channel. Ca2+ entry further induces break-down of the phospholipid asymmetry in the host membrane.

7927758|t|Abrogation of gamma interferon-induced inhibition of Ehrlichia chaffeensis infection in human monocytes with iron-transferrin.
7927758|a|Ehrlichia chaffeensis is an obligate intracellular bacterium which infects cells of the macrophage/monocyte lineage. To test whether gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) inhibits infection of monocytes with E. chaffeensis, human peripheral blood monocytes were incubated with recombinant human IFN-gamma for 3 h and then exposed to E. chaffeensis. With 2,000 U of IFN-gamma per ml, maximal inhibition of infection by E. chaffeensis was observed. THP-1 cells, a human monocyte cell line, pretreated with phorbol myristic acetate or not pretreated, were incubated with various concentrations of IFN-gamma. Maximum inhibition was obtained at 1,000 U of IFN-gamma per ml with phorbol myristic acetate-treated THP-1 cells. However, nontreated cells did not achieve a similar level of anti-ehrlichial activity even with 10,000 U of IFN-gamma per ml. IFN-gamma given within 6 h postinfection was effective in inhibiting E. chaffeensis. Nitric oxide production was not demonstrated in the monocyte medium incubated with IFN-gamma and E. chaffeensis. None of the reactive oxygen intermediate scavengers tested blocked the IFN-gamma-induced anti-ehrlichial activity. Deferoxamine, an intracellular iron chelator, at 15 microM completely inhibited the survival of E. chaffeensis. Iron-saturated transferrin at 1.67 mg/ml completely reversed the IFN-gamma-induced ehrlichial killing. These results indicate that (i) E. chaffeensis is sensitive to intracytoplasmic iron depletion, (ii) E. chaffeensis is sensitive to IFN-gamma-induced killing, and (iii) the anti-ehrlichial activity induced in human monocytes by IFN-gamma is mediated by limitation of available cytoplasmic iron and is not due to the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates or nitric oxide.

6323037|t|Effects of ceruloplasmin and the haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex on the oxygen-dependent reduction in growth of human diploid fibroblasts in serum-free, albumin containing medium.
6323037|a|We examined that growth-promoting activity of two different human albumin (HSA) preparations for human diploid fibroblasts in serum-free RITC 80-7 medium. The activity of one preparation (sample A) was affected markedly by environmental oxygen, whereas the other (sample B) was little affected. Sample B contained ceruloplasmin (Cp) and haptoglobin (Hp) as impurities. To detect the generation of superoxide anion in the media the amount of reduction of cytochrome c that is inhibited by superoxide dismutase (SOD) was determined. In an aerobic environment it was relatively large in comparison with reduction inhibited in a hypoxic environment. Reduction in the sample A with HSA-supplemented medium was relatively large in comparison with that in sample B with HSA-supplemented medium. The reduction of cytochrome c also was inhibited by Cp (25 mg/l) and catalase (4000 units/ml). Moreover, SOD, Cp, catalase and Hp.Hb (but not Hp) partially prevented oxygen-dependent reduction in growth in an aerobic environment when added to sample A HSA-supplemented medium. These results suggest that Cp and Hp.Hb act as an antioxidants in culture.

18281046|t|SGLT-1-mediated glucose uptake protects human intestinal epithelial cells against Giardia duodenalis-induced apoptosis.
18281046|a|Infection with Giardia duodenalis is one of the most common causes of waterborne diarrheal disease worldwide. Mechanisms of pathogenesis and host response in giardiasis remain incompletely understood. Previous studies have shown that exposure to G. duodenalis products induce apoptosis in enterocytes. We recently discovered that sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter (SGLT)-1-mediated glucose uptake modulates enterocytic cell death induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide. The aim of this study was to examine whether enhanced epithelial SGLT-1 activity may constitute a novel mechanism of host defense against G. duodenalis-induced apoptosis. SGLT-1-transfected Caco-2 cells were exposed to G. duodenalis products in low (5mM) or high (25mM) glucose media. In low glucose environments, G. duodenalis-induced caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation in these cells. These apoptotic phenomena were abolished in the presence of high glucose. A soluble proteolytic fraction of G. duodenalis was found to upregulate SGLT-1-mediated glucose uptake in a dose- and time-dependent manner, in association with increased apical SGLT-1 expression on epithelial cells. Kinetic analysis showed that this phenomenon resulted from an increase in the maximal rate of sugar transport (V(max)) by SGLT-1, with no change in the affinity constant (K(m)). The addition of phloridzin (a competitive inhibitor for glucose binding to SGLT-1) abolished the anti-apoptotic effects exerted by high glucose. Together, the findings indicate that SGLT-1-dependent glucose uptake may represent a novel epithelial cell rescue mechanism against G. duodenalis-induced apoptosis.

9231036|t|Effects of 17 beta-estradiol and progesterone on migration of human monocytic THP-1 cells stimulated by minimally oxidized low-density lipoprotein in vitro.
9231036|a|OBJECTIVE: Many epidemiological studies have shown that postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has a beneficial effect on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of estrogen and progestin on the migration of monocytes induced by minimally oxidized low-density lipoprotein (m-ox-LDL) in vitro. METHODS: Human monocytic THP-1 cells were used for the study. Migration assay was performed using a modified Boyden chamber. RESULTS: The presence of estrogen receptors was determined in THP-1 cells by Western and Northern blot analysis. Although native LDL had no significant effects on the migration of THP-1 cells, m-ox-LDL increased the migration of THP-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Although 17 beta-estradiol (E2, 10(-9)-10(-6) M) inhibited the 10 micrograms/ml-induced migration of THP-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner, estrone (E1), estriol (E3) and progesterone (P) had no significant effects. The combination of P (10(-9)-10(-6) M) did not show any effect on the inhibitory effect of 10(-7) M E2. Preincubation of THP-1 cells with the anti-estrogenic agent, tamoxifen (10(-6) M), significantly antagonized the inhibitory effect of 10(-7) M E2. m-ox-LDL stimulated MCP-1 secretion from THP-1 cells, which was reduced by E2. Anti-human MCP-1 neutralizing antibody inhibited the migration of THP-1 cells stimulated by m-ox-LDL. E2 also inhibited the 10 ng/ml MCP-1-induced migration of THP-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the inhibitory effect of E2 on the migration of monocytes might be one of the factors involved in the decreased incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in premenopausal women and postmenopausal HRT.

2581614|t|Lead-induced activation and inhibition of potassium-selective channels in the human red blood cell.
2581614|a|The selective increase of net K+ permeability in human red cells brought about by either Ca2+ or lead was studied using a light scattering technique to measure net K+ fluxes in cell suspensions and the patch-clamp technique to study K+ transport in individual K+-selective channels of the red cell membrane. Using ultrapure solutions it was demonstrated that the effect of lead is neither the indirect consequence of a lead-induced increase of the accessibility of the receptor sites of the K+-selective channels to traces of Ca2+ that are present as contamination in analytical grade reagents nor to the release of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ stores. It is further shown that in cell-free membrane patches low concentrations of lead (10 microM) in Suprapur solutions evoke the same single-channel events as added Ca2+ and that this activity can be inhibited by high concentrations of lead (100 microM), similar to the net KCl efflux measured by means of the light scattering technique. It is concluded, therefore, that both Ca2+ and lead independently activate the same K+-selective channels in the red cell membrane.

11709547|t|Altered levels of growth-related and novel gene transcripts in reproductive and other tissues of female mice overexpressing spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT).
11709547|a|Overexpression of SSAT (polyamine catabolic enzyme) in female mice results in impaired ovarian folliculogenesis and uterine hypoplasia. To identify the molecular basis for this, the gene expression profiles in uterus and ovary and for comparison, liver and kidney, from non-transgenic (NT) and SSAT transgenic (ST) mice were compared. The mRNA abundance for lipoprotein lipase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was elevated in all four ST (>NT) tissues. The translation initiation factor-3 subunit 5 mRNA, and transcripts related to endogenous murine leukemia provirus (MLV-related) and murine retrovirus-related sequences (MuRRS) were decreased in ST tissues. A novel calmodulin-related mRNA was strongly induced in ST liver and kidney. SSAT overexpression was associated with increased levels of IGF-binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2) in the uterus and ovary, and a reduction in IGFBP-3 mRNA levels in the uterus. Exogenous spermidine and spermine elevated endogenous IGFBP-2 and SSAT mRNA abundance, whereas, putrescine stimulated IGFBP-2 mRNA abundance and transfected IGFBP-2 gene promoter activity in human (Hec-1-A) uterine cells. Sp1 and BTEB1 mRNAs that encode transcription factors for the IGFBP-2 gene also were induced in some ST tissues. The data suggest that SSAT and polyamines are important for the control of molecular pathways underlying reproductive tract tissue growth, phenotype, and function.

26988690|t|Cobalt oxide nanoparticles aggravate DNA damage and cell death in eggplant via mitochondrial swelling and NO signaling pathway.
26988690|a|BACKGROUND: Despite manifold benefits of nanoparticles (NPs), less information on the risks of NPs to human health and environment has been studied. Cobalt oxide nanoparticles (Co3O4-NPs) have been reported to cause toxicity in several organisms. In this study, we have investigated the role of Co3O4-NPs in inducing phytotoxicity, cellular DNA damage and apoptosis in eggplant (Solanum melongena L. cv. Violetta lunga 2). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on Co3O4-NPs showing phytotoxicity in eggplant. RESULTS: The data revealed that eggplant seeds treated with Co3O4-NPs for 2 h at a concentration of 1.0 mg/ml retarded root length by 81.5 % upon 7 days incubation in a moist chamber. Ultrastructural analysis by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrated the uptake and translocation of Co3O4-NPs into the cytoplasm. Intracellular presence of Co3O4-NPs triggered subcellular changes such as degeneration of mitochondrial cristae, abundance of peroxisomes and excessive vacuolization. Flow cytometric analysis of Co3O4-NPs (1.0 mg/ml) treated root protoplasts revealed 157, 282 and 178 % increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), membrane potential (ΔΨm) and nitric oxide (NO), respectively. Besides, the esterase activity in treated protoplasts was also found compromised. About 2.4-fold greater level of DNA damage, as compared to untreated control was observed in Comet assay, and 73.2 % of Co3O4-NPs treated cells appeared apoptotic in flow cytometry based cell cycle analysis. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrate the phytotoxic potential of Co3O4-NPs in terms of reduction in seed germination, root growth, greater level of DNA and mitochondrial damage, oxidative stress and cell death in eggplant. The data generated from this study will provide a strong background to draw attention on Co3O4-NPs environmental hazards to vegetable crops.

23041349|t|In vitro oxidative inactivation of human presequence protease (hPreP).
23041349|a|The mitochondrial peptidasome called presequence protease (PreP) is responsible for the degradation of presequences and other unstructured peptides including the amyloid-β peptide, whose accumulation may have deleterious effects on mitochondrial function. Recent studies showed that PreP activity is reduced in Alzheimer disease (AD) patients and AD mouse models compared to controls, which correlated with an enhanced reactive oxygen species production in mitochondria. In this study, we have investigated the effects of a biologically relevant oxidant, hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), on the activity of recombinant human PreP (hPreP). H(2)O(2) inhibited hPreP activity in a concentration-dependent manner, resulting in oxidation of amino acid residues (detected by carbonylation) and lowered protein stability. Substitution of the evolutionarily conserved methionine 206 for leucine resulted in increased sensitivity of hPreP to oxidation, indicating a possible protective role of M206 as internal antioxidant. The activity of hPreP oxidized at low concentrations of H(2)O(2) could be restored by methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA), an enzyme that localizes to the mitochondrial matrix, suggesting that hPreP constitutes a substrate for MsrA. In summary, our in vitro results suggest a possible redox control of hPreP in the mitochondrial matrix and support the protective role of the conserved methionine 206 residue as an internal antioxidant.

5645853|t|Effect of antidiuretic hormone on human small intestinal water and solute transport.
5645853|a|The effect of i.v. Pitressin (ADH) in a dose of 1 U/hr on permeability characteristics and on absorptive capacity of the normal human small intestine was investigated. The method of continuous intestinal perfusion was employed with polyethylene glycol 4000 as a nonabsorbable marker. Unidirectional flux rates of Na and H(2)O were calculated from the disappearance of (22)Na and of (3)HOH from isotonic saline solution within the intestinal lumen. Each study consisted of two successive perfusion periods: one while the subject was hydrated, the other during ADH infusion or while the subject was dehydrated. Water and sodium absorption from isotonic NaCl occurred in the hydrated state and was abolished by ADH as well as by dehydration in the jejunum. In some instances, net gain of water and sodium in the lumen occurred. In the ileum, ADH and dehydration caused a decrease in water and sodium absorption rate. By contrast, unidirectional flux into the intestinal lumen of water and sodium, as well as dextrose and D-xylose diffusion, remained unchanged by ADH. During perfusions with hypertonic urea solutions the rates of sodium and water entry into the intestine were greatly increased during i.v. ADH infusion, whereas urea loss from the study segment remained constant. ADH in the dosage used did not affect human intestinal motility. The results suggest that circulating ADH in physiologic concentrations affects the small intestine in one of two ways: increased secretion of water and salt into the lumen or direct interference with the active sodium transport mechanism.

22506049|t|A new human NHERF1 mutation decreases renal phosphate transporter NPT2a expression by a PTH-independent mechanism.
22506049|a|BACKGROUND: The sodium-hydrogen exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1) binds to the main renal phosphate transporter NPT2a and to the parathyroid hormone (PTH) receptor. We have recently identified mutations in NHERF1 that decrease renal phosphate reabsorption by increasing PTH-induced cAMP production in the renal proximal tubule. METHODS: We compared relevant parameters of phosphate homeostasis in a patient with a previously undescribed mutation in NHERF1 and in control subjects. We expressed the mutant NHERF1 protein in Xenopus Oocytes and in cultured cells to study its effects on phosphate transport and PTH-induced cAMP production. RESULTS: We identified in a patient with inappropriate renal phosphate reabsorption a previously unidentified mutation (E68A) located in the PDZ1 domain of NHERF1.We report the consequences of this mutation on NHERF1 function. E68A mutation did not modify cAMP production in the patient. PTH-induced cAMP synthesis and PKC activity were not altered by E68A mutation in renal cells in culture. In contrast to wild-type NHERF1, expression of the E68A mutant in Xenopus oocytes and in human cells failed to increase phosphate transport. Pull down experiments showed that E68A mutant did not interact with NPT2a, which robustly interacted with wild type NHERF1 and previously identified mutants. Biotinylation studies revealed that E68A mutant was unable to increase cell surface expression of NPT2a. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the PDZ1 domain is critical for NHERF1-NPT2a interaction in humans and for the control of NPT2a expression at the plasma membrane. Thus we have identified a new mechanism of renal phosphate loss and shown that different mutations in NHERF1 can alter renal phosphate reabsorption via distinct mechanisms.

11641060|t|Transient translocation of hemidesmosomal bullous pemphigoid antigen 1 from cytosol to membrane fractions by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment and Ca2+-switch in a human carcinoma cell line.
11641060|a|We previously showed that 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and Ca2+-switch from low (0.07 mM) to normal (1.87 mM) concentration in culture medium, which were also linked to activation of protein kinase C (PKC), lead to phosphorylation of 180 kDa-bullous pemphigoid antigen (BPAG) 2, but not of 230 kDa-BPAG1, and possibly to its disassembly from hemidesmosomes in a human squamous cell carcinoma cell line (DJM-1). In this study, we examined the effects of TPA and Ca2+-switch on intracellular localization of BPAG1 by immuno-blotting and immuno-fluorescence microscopy with monoclonal antibodies to the antigen after sub-cellular fractionation. In DJM-1 cells cultured in low Ca2+ medium, BPAG1 was detected as phosphate buffered saline-soluble (cytosolic), Triton X-100 soluble (roughly membrane-associated) and Triton X-100 insoluble (cytoskeleton-bound) forms, whereas in normal Ca2+-grown cells only as cytosolic and cytoskeleton-bound forms. In normal Ca2+-cultured cells, TPA (50 nM) caused a complete translocation of BPAG1 from cytosol to membrane fractions within 10 min, that was inhibited by pretreatment with H7 (a selective PKC inhibitor) at 40 microM. After 30 min and 4 h of TPA-treatment, BPAG1 was exclusively detected in cytoskeleton fractions. Morphologically, immuno-fluorescence microscopy showed that treatment caused a marked reduction of BPAG1 from the cytoplasm and generated a linear pattern at cell-cell contacts, suggesting translocation of BPAG1 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. In contrast, the Ca2+-switch from low to normal caused a prominent increase of BPAG1, both in cytosolic and membrane-associated forms after 4 h, that was inhibited both with H7 and cycloheximide (an inhibitor of protein synthesis) at 70 microM, suggesting a role for PKC and BPAG1 synthesis in these Ca2+-induced effects. These results suggest that TPA and Ca2+-switch induced BPAG1 translocation to membrane fractions possibly mediated by PKC-activation. Furthermore, whereas TPA affects the redistribution of BPAG1 among their pools without inducing their synthesis, Ca2+-switch induces both membrane translocation and synthesis of BPAG1, suggesting involvement of signaling other than PKC pathways in control of BPAG1 synthesis.

28269670|t|Savitzky-Golay coupled with digital bandpass filtering as a pre-processing technique in the quantitative analysis of glucose from near infrared spectra.
28269670|a|This paper proposes a novel pre-processing method based on combining bandpass with Savitzky-Golay filtering to further improve the prediction performance of the linear calibration models Principal Component Regression (PCR) and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) in near infrared spectroscopy. The proposed method is compared to the highly efficient RReliefF pre-processing technique for further evaluation. The developed calibration models have been validated to predict the glucose concentration from near infrared spectra of a mixture of glucose and human serum albumin in a phosphate buffer solution. The results show that the proposed technique improves the prediction performance of both the PCR and PLSR models and achieve better results than the RReliefF technique.

2600673|t|Calculations of the distribution of zinc in a computer model of human serum.
2600673|a|During the last decade, investigators employing a wide variety of separation techniques have reported that serum albumin, rather than serum transferrin, is the major carrier protein for labile zinc. However, in contrast to these studies, a simple comparison of the zinc binding constants for albumin and transferrin suggests a significant role for transferrin with regard to serum zinc transport. In the present study multicomponent equilibrium calculations that incorporate recently determined binding constants for zinc-transferrin as well as equilibrium constants for the binding of bicarbonate, sulfate and phosphate to apotransferrin have been used to model the distribution of labile zinc in normal human serum. Anion binding has a major impact on the predicted zinc distribution, lowering the percentage of zinc bound to transferrin from 56% to 11%. The model gives approximately 1% zinc as low-molecular-weight complexes. The improved model results are in good agreement with biological studies on the distribution of zinc among serum proteins.

29084681|t|Synthesis of secondary metabolites by Cladosporium resinae (NRL-6437) under different growth media and chemical inducers and their pharmaceutical activity.
29084681|a|The role of different growth media and chemical enhancer on synthesis of secondary metabolites Cladosporium resinae (NRL-6437) was investigated for their in vitro biological activities. Cladosporium resinae (NRL-6437) were grown in various nutrient media (Czapeak-dox Broth (CB), Czapeak Yeast-extract Broth (CYB), Yeast Extract Sucrose (YES), Potato Dextrose Broth (PDB) and Czapeak-dox (supplemented with glucose and starch) Broth (CGSB) for the production of metabolites. Two chemical epigenetic modifiers (suberoyl-anilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and 5-azacytidine (5-AZA) were also used for the expression of silent genes for secondary metabolite production. Our results indicated that among different media, Czapeak yeast extract broth produced more secondary metabolites. Application of 15mM of both modifiers was effective for the expressions of silent genes resulting in an increased metabolites production. Secondary metabolites extracted in ethyl acetate and fractionized in n-Hexane were also tested for their biological activity. The secondary metabolites revealed varying degrees of growth inhibitions of the tested organisms. Similarly, these metabolites were also active against brine shrimps and Lemna.

16423196|t|Pulmonary arterial hypertension: new insights and new hope.
16423196|a|Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a devastating disorder characterized by abnormal increased vasoconstriction and vascular remodelling. In this review we discuss the pathophysiology, genetic basis and clinical features of this disorder. Current therapy of PAH is based on an understanding of its pathogenesis, and we review current treatment options based on the pathophysiology of the disease. We discuss three promising novel therapies studied in animal models and human tissue. All three therapies appear to prevent and reduce pulmonary arterial medial hyperplasia through their anti-proliferative and/or pro-apoptotic effects: serotonin transporter inhibitors by blocking serotonin uptake; dichloroacetate by activating voltage-gated potassium channels; and simvastatin by preventing activation of small GTPases.

17241129|t|Luteinizing hormone receptor mediates neuronal pregnenolone production via up-regulation of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein expression.
17241129|a|The functional consequences of luteinizing hormone/human chorionic gonadotropin signaling via neuronal luteinizing hormone/human chorionic gonadotropin receptors expressed throughout the brain remain unclear. A primary function of luteinizing hormone (LH) in the gonads is the stimulation of sex steroid production. As LH can cross the blood-brain barrier, present in cerebrospinal fluid and is expressed by neuronal cells, we tested whether LH might also modulate steroid synthesis in the brain. Treatment of differentiated rat primary hippocampal neurons and human M17 neuroblastoma cells with LH (100 mIU/mL) resulted in a twofold increase in pregnenolone secretion in both cell types, suggesting an increase in P450scc-mediated cleavage of cholesterol to pregnenolone and its secretion from neurons. To explore how LH might regulate the synthesis of pregnenolone, the precursor for steroid synthesis, we treated rat primary hippocampal neurons with LH (0, 10 and 100 mIU/mL) and measured changes in the expression of LH receptor and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR). LH induced a rapid (within 30 min) increase in the expression of StAR, but induced a dose-dependent decrease in LH receptor expression. Consistent with these results, the suppression of serum LH in young rats treated with leuprolide acetate for 4 months down-regulated StAR expression, but increased LH receptor expression in the brain. Taken together, these results indicate that LH induces neuronal pregnenolone production by modulating the expression of the LH receptor, increasing mitochondrial cholesterol transport and increasing P450scc-mediated cleavage of cholesterol for pregnenolone synthesis and secretion.

8977763|t|Hypoparathyroidism and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in a patient with Kearns-Sayre syndrome harbouring a mitochondrial DNA deletion.
8977763|a|We report a 17-year-old girl with short stature, external ophthalmoplegia, atypical retinal pigmentary degeneration, sensorineural hearing loss, and cardiac conduction defect (Kearns-Sayre syndrome). A large-scale deletion (6741 base pairs) in mitochondrial DNA was found in her muscle specimen. She also had insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). On admission, her plasma glucose level was elevated at 31.0mmol/l with mild ketoacidosis, and haemoglobinA1c elevated at 16.5%. After improvement of diabetic ketoacidosis, she was placed on insulin 24-30 units/day despite her small body weight of 25 kg. There was reduced excretion of urinary C-peptide at 3.97 nmol/day. In addition, she had idiopathic hypoparathyroidism with a serum calcium level of 2.15 mmol/l, phosphate 1.7 mmol/l, and intact PTH below 10 ng/l. Human leucocyte associated antigen typing showed A24, A26; B54, B61; CW1, CW3; DR8, DR14; DQ1 and DQ3, suggesting that the presence of HLA-A24 and CW3 antigen contributed to the association of IDDM and hypoparathyroidism, similar to Japanese patients with polyglandular autoimmune syndrome, complicated by hypoparathyroidism and IDDM. We suggest that a genetic linkage, as well as mitochondrial dysfunction, may be responsible for the association of the two disease states. This is an extremely rare case of Kearns-Sayre syndrome, presenting in association with IDDM and idiopathic hypoparathyroidism.

25320715|t|Anti-aging Potential of Extracts Prepared from Fruits and Medicinal Herbs Cultivated in the Gyeongnam Area of Korea.
25320715|a|Many recent studies have focused on maintaining a healthy life by preventing and/or postponing the aging process. Numerous studies have reported that continuous exposure to reactive oxygen species can stimulate skin aging and that excessive accumulation of fat can cause an impaired skin barrier and tissue structure alterations. Thus, the maintenance of antioxidant homeostasis and the suppression of adipose accumulation are important strategies for skin anti-aging. Here, we prepared three types of extracts [whole juice, acetone-perchloric acid (PCA), and ethanol] from 20 fruits and medicinal herbs native to the Gyeongnam area of Korea. The total phenolic content of each extract was analyzed, and we observed higher total phenolic contents in the medicinal herbs. Consistent with this, the results of the oxygen radical absorbance activity capacity assay indicated that the in vitro antioxidant activities of the medicinal herb extracts were stronger than those of the fruit extracts. The fruits and medicinal herbs had strong effects on cell-based systems, including H2O2-induced oxidative stress in human keratinocytes and 3T3-L1 lipid accumulation. Nishimura Wase persimmon, Taishu persimmon, wrinkled giant hyssop, sweet wormwood, Chinese cedar, red perilla, tan shen, hiyodori-jogo, and cramp bark may be natural anti-aging materials with effective antioxidant and anti-adipogenic activities. Taken together, our findings may provide scientific evidence supporting the development of functional foods and nutraceuticals from fruits and medicinal herbs.

15672465|t|Regulation of Na,K-pump-mediated transport by prolactin in cultured human prostate epithelial cells.
15672465|a|The prostate gland is unique in its ability to secrete large amounts of zinc and citrate, suggesting that it employs unusual transport mechanisms. Intracellular ionic homeostasis in prostate is likely to be mediated by the Na,K-pump, yet there have been few studies of its regulation in this tissue. Accordingly, we explored the expression of the Na,K-pump in PC3 cells, an established cell line of human prostate epithelial cells. Total RNA from confluent monolayers of PC3 cells was isolated, reverse transcribed, and the resulting complementary DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers specific for each of the pump's constituent subunits. The amplification revealed a complex pattern of Na,K-pump expression, with detection of mRNAs encoding the alpha1-, alpha3-, alpha4-, betal-, beta2- and beta3-isoforms. We next examined the effect on pump activity of prolactin, an important mediator of cell proliferation in prostate cancer. Monolayers exposed to 10 nM prolactin for 24 hr revealed an inhibition of 40% in ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake, a sensitive measure of pump-mediated transport. These experiments suggest that the unique transport properties of prostate may depend, at least in part, on a complicated pattern of Na,K-pump expression and regulation.

10790685|t|Dynamic in vivo (31)P nuclear magnetic resonance study of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in glucose-limited chemostat culture during the aerobic-anaerobic shift.
10790685|a|The purpose of this work was to analyse in vivo the influence of sudden oxygen depletion on Saccharomyces cerevisiae, grown in glucose-limited chemostat culture, using a recently developed cyclone reactor coupled with (31)P NMR spectroscopy. Before, during and after the transition, intracellular and extracellular phosphorylated metabolites as well as the pHs in the different cellular compartments were monitored with a time resolution of 2.5 min. The employed integrated NMR bioreactor system allowed the defined glucose-limited continuous cultivation of yeast at a density of 75 g DW/l and a p(O(2)) of 30% air saturation. A purely oxidative metabolism was maintained at all times. In vivo (31)P NMR spectra obtained were of excellent quality and even allowed the detection of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). During the switch from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, a rapid, significant decrease of intracellular ATP and PEP levels was observed and the cytoplasmic pH decreased from 7.5 to 6.8. This change, which was accompanied by a transient influx of extracellular inorganic phosphate (P(i)), appeared to correlate linearly with the decrease of the ATP concentration, suggesting that the cause of the partial collapse of the plasma membrane pH gradient was a reduced availability of ATP. The complete phosphorous balance established from our measurement data showed that polyphosphate was not the source of the increased intracellular P(i). The derived intracellular P(i), ATP and ADP concentration data confirmed that the glycolytic flux at the level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase and enolase enzymes is mainly controlled by thermodynamic constraints.

7616217|t|Sustained dopamine release induced by secretoneurin in the striatum of the rat: a microdialysis study.
7616217|a|Secretoneurin (SN) is a neuropeptide derived from secretogranin II that is found in brain and endocrine tissues. The aim of the present study was to determine the influence of this novel peptide on dopamine (DA) release from rat striatum using the microdialysis technique. Rat SN (1-30 mumol/L added to the dialysis buffer) enhanced DA outflow of awake rats in a concentration-dependent way without marked effects on the outflow of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid or homovanillic acid. The increase in extracellular DA content caused by the peptide was observed throughout the entire period of administration (up to 4 h). Human SN and its 15-amino-acid C-terminal sequence also increased DA outflow, but the effects were smaller than those of rat SN. Two other peptides derived from secretogranin II were without effect on DA efflux. These results establish that SN has a pronounced effect on DA release under in vivo conditions.

7302605|a|The use of methylxanthine molecules labeled with stable isotopes (15CN and 13C) gives the following results: 1. The biotransformation of theophylline to caffeine by N-7 methylation occurs in premature newborns treated with this methylxanthine. 2. It permits us to differentiate with perfect selectivity the two origins of caffeine: exogenous caffeine coming from breast feeding and endogenous caffeine coming from the infant's metabolism. 3. It allows us to measure the placental transfer of theophylline administered to the mother and to show that the fetus can metabolize this xanthine into caffeine.

24375022|t|Caffeine accelerates recovery from general anesthesia.
24375022|a|General anesthetics inhibit neurotransmitter release from both neurons and secretory cells. If inhibition of neurotransmitter release is part of an anesthetic mechanism of action, then drugs that facilitate neurotransmitter release may aid in reversing general anesthesia. Drugs that elevate intracellular cAMP levels are known to facilitate neurotransmitter release. Three cAMP elevating drugs (forskolin, theophylline, and caffeine) were tested; all three drugs reversed the inhibition of neurotransmitter release produced by isoflurane in PC12 cells in vitro. The drugs were tested in isoflurane-anesthetized rats. Animals were injected with either saline or saline containing drug. All three drugs dramatically accelerated recovery from isoflurane anesthesia, but caffeine was most effective. None of the drugs, at the concentrations tested, had significant effects on breathing rates, O2 saturation, heart rate, or blood pressure in anesthetized animals. Caffeine alone was tested on propofol-anesthetized rats where it dramatically accelerated recovery from anesthesia. The ability of caffeine to accelerate recovery from anesthesia for different chemical classes of anesthetics, isoflurane and propofol, opens the possibility that it will do so for all commonly used general anesthetics, although additional studies will be required to determine whether this is in fact the case. Because anesthesia in rodents is thought to be similar to that in humans, these results suggest that caffeine might allow for rapid and uniform emergence from general anesthesia in human patients.

6423017|t|Increased sensitivity of arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation in the presence of carbon dioxide.
6423017|a|The effects of carbon dioxide on citrated human platelet-rich plasma (PRP) have been studied as a means of imitating the changes in pH and PCO2 observed in inflammation and tissue fluid stasis. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation was inhibited in CO2-treated PRP. In contrast, CO2-treated platelets were rendered up to eight times more sensitive to sodium arachidonate and this effect could be imitated by the addition of exogenous calcium 1 min before the addition of arachidonate. The effects of CO2 on ADP-induced and arachidonate-induced aggregation were abolished if the CO2 was allowed to disperse from treated PRP subsequently exposed to air, suggesting no permanent alteration in platelet metabolism. The increased sensitivity of arachidonate-induced aggregation with lowered pH may be a significant factor in influencing platelet behaviour in haemostasis.

12914526|t|Hormonal and developmental regulation of the mouse aldose reductase-like gene akr1b7 expression in Leydig cells.
12914526|a|The akr1b7 gene encodes an aldose reductase-like protein that is responsible for detoxifying isocaproaldehyde generated by the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone. The regulation of gene expression by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was first investigated in the MA-10 Leydig tumor cell line. The akr1b7 gene was constitutively expressed and accumulation of its mRNA was increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner by treatment with hCG. akr1b7 mRNA accumulation was sharply increased in the presence of 0.25 nM hCG and it reached a fivefold increase within 2 h. AKR1B7 protein accumulation was delayed compared with that of the corresponding mRNA. In agreement, hCG significantly increased the levels of mRNA and protein of akr1b7 in primary cultures of adult mouse Leydig cells, thus suggesting that LH potentially regulates akr1b7 gene expression in vivo. Expression of akr1b7 was developmentally regulated in the testis. Unexpectedly, levels of akr1b7 mRNA increased from embryonic day 15 to the day of birth and declined until adulthood while AKR1B7 protein levels followed an inverse pattern, suggesting an important role for translational mechanisms.

6111766|t|Neuroleptic-induced acute dystonic reactions may be due to enhanced dopamine release on to supersensitive postsynaptic receptors.
6111766|a|Oral administration of butaperazine (40 mg per kilogram) to rats increased dopamine turnover, as measured by elevation of striatal and mesolimbic concentrations of homovanillic acid and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, for 24 to 48 hours. Initially, this dose of butaperazine inhibited stereotyped behavior in response to subcutaneous administration of apomorphine, but this effect was reversed at 12 hours. Later, animals had normal or exaggerated responses to apomorphine. The data suggest that the critical 20- to 28-hour period after butaperazine administration, when most human acute dystonic reactions occur, normal or supersensitive cerebral dopamine receptors are exposed to an excessive synaptic release of dopamine. This may be responsible for the drug-induced dystonia.

10653147|t|Effect of cultivation mode on a bioprocess for chromium yeast biomass enrichment.
10653147|a|Defined cultivation media for yeast growth which contained 278.8 mM of glucose and 0.1 mM of chromium(III) added as K2Cr(SO4)2 x 12 H2O was used in batch and combined batch/fed-batch cultivation mode. In fed batch cultivation mode the rate of substrate addition remained constant during growth of yeast and corresponded to a growth rate of 0.25 h(-1). In both cases the growth and yeast activity was followed by on line measurement of optical density, pH and pO2 at 30 degrees C. At the end of the bioprocess the concentration of protein in yeast biomass was determined off line by the biuret reaction. Total and organically bound chromium was detected by ETA-AAS. Different cultivation modes affected the total cell protein concentration of yeast grown in media supplemented with chromium. In batch process the protein content represented 25.7% of dry yeast biomass, in contrast in the mixed bioprocess this value was 16.9% one the same period of time. The influence of cultivation mode on chromium uptake was seen in total chromium accumulation which reached 8.68 +/- 0.16 micromol g(-1) d.wt. in batch and 1.92 +/- 0.04 micromol of chromium g(-1) of dry yeast biomass in combined batch/fed-batch cultivation mode. The opposite was observed for organically bound chromium. The 60% of total accumulated chromium was organically bound during yeast growth in combined batch/fed-batch mode. When yeast was grown in batch mode this value attained 13.5%. Results suggested that a combined batch/fed-batch mode of cultivation was more effective over a batch system in chromium biotransformation to organically bound chromium, regardless of the lower protein ratio determined in the yeast biomass.

11728528|t|Arginine inhibits hemostasis activation.
11728528|a|BACKGROUND: The diagnosis and the therapy of in vivo hemostasis activation is of great clinical importance. Artefactual changes of the hemostasis (i.e., coagulation or fibrinolysis) in vitro have to be prevented. Usual in vitro anticoagulation by sodium citrate does not fully inhibit coagulation--or fibrinolysis--activation. Therefore, there is need for a simple physiologic inhibitor of hemostasis activation both in diagnosis and therapy of hemostasis activation. METHODS: Whole blood clotting time (WBCT), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), in vitro bleeding test closure time (IVBT-CT), and whole blood aggregometry (WBA) were determined in normal human blood or plasma, supplemented with increasing concentrations of L-arginine or guanidine. RESULTS: Arginine in concentrations of 5-100 mM inhibited the WBCT, PT, APTT, IVBT-CT, and WBA. Arginine (50 mM) resulted in a two-fold prolongation of WBCT, PT, or IVBT-CT (the anti-epinephrine action is superior to the anti-ADP action), a four-fold prolongation of APTT or a 60% inhibition of WBA. CONCLUSION: L-Arginine (or guanidine) inhibited the activation of hemostasis. Arginine might be used as hemostasis stabilizer both in the diagnosis and therapy of hemostasis activation. The usage of arginine as an in vitro hemostasis inhibitor might be indicated in the diagnosis of hemostasis activation, as occurring in pharmacological thrombolysis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The storage of blood or blood products might be improved by arginine stabilization. The amino acid (and nitric oxide precursor) L-arginine could be an interesting new pharmacologic agent to inhibit a pathologic hemostasis activation.

11114155|t|Sensory properties of citric acid: psychophysical evidence for sensitization, self-desensitization, cross-desensitization and cross-stimulus-induced recovery following capsaicin.
11114155|a|In a first experiment, human subjects used a bipolar scale to rate the irritant sensation elicited by 10 sequentially repeated applications of either 3 ppm capsaicin or 250 mM citric acid on one side of the dorsal surface of the tongue, at 1 min intervals (30 s inter-stimulus interval). Citric acid-evoked irritation significantly increased across trials, consistent with sensitization. With capsaicin there was a large degree of inter- and intra-individual variation in successive ratings with no overall sensitization. Following the sequential stimulation series and a 10 min rest period, self- and cross-desensitization effects were tested in a two-alternative forced choice (2-AFC) paradigm by placing either citric acid or capsaicin on both sides of the tongue and asking subjects to indicate which side of the tongue yielded a stronger irritant sensation. Subjects also gave separate intensity ratings for irritation on each side of the tongue. Capsaicin self-desensitization was confirmed, while cross-desensitization to citric acid was not observed. In addition, citric acid self-desensitization and cross-desensitization to capsaicin were observed. In a second experiment a stronger capsaicin solution (33 ppm) was applied to one side of the tongue using cotton swabs. After the burning sensation elicited by capsaicin had disappeared, citric acid was applied bilaterally and cross-desensitization was observed using the same 2-AFC and rating procedures. This was followed by repeated re-application of citric acid at 1 min intervals to the capsaicin-treated side. The irritant sensation elicited by citric acid increased significantly, indicating a 'cross-stimulus-induced recovery' from capsaicin desensitization. In a final experiment we investigated the effect of the sodium channel blocker amiloride on the perceived irritation elicited by citric acid or capsaicin. Following application of amiloride to one side of the tongue with cotton swabs, either citric acid or capsaicin was applied bilaterally and subjects asked to perform a 2-AFC and intensity ratings. Amiloride significantly, albeit weakly, reduced the irritation elicited by citric acid while it weakly but significantly enhanced capsaicin-evoked irritation. These findings are discussed in terms of involvement of vanilloid and acid-sensitive ion channels in acid-evoked irritation and pain.

26620920|t|Production of butyrate from lysine and the Amadori product fructoselysine by a human gut commensal.
26620920|a|Human intestinal bacteria produce butyrate, which has signalling properties and can be used as energy source by enterocytes thus influencing colonic health. However, the pathways and the identity of bacteria involved in this process remain unclear. Here we describe the isolation from the human intestine of Intestinimonas strain AF211, a bacterium that can convert lysine stoichiometrically into butyrate and acetate when grown in a synthetic medium. Intestinimonas AF211 also converts the Amadori product fructoselysine, which is abundantly formed in heated foods via the Maillard reaction, into butyrate. The butyrogenic pathway includes a specific CoA transferase that is overproduced during growth on lysine. Bacteria related to Intestinimonas AF211 as well as the genetic coding capacity for fructoselysine conversion are abundantly present in colonic samples from some healthy human subjects. Our results indicate that protein can serve as a source of butyrate in the human colon, and its conversion by Intestinimonas AF211 and related butyrogens may protect the host from the undesired side effects of Amadori reaction products.

26636116|t|The Effect of Aloe Vera, Pomegranate Peel, Grape Seed Extract, Green Tea, and Sodium Ascorbate as Antioxidants on the Shear Bond Strength of Composite Resin to Home-bleached Enamel.
26636116|a|STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM: Immediate application of bonding agent to home- bleached enamel leads to significant reduction in the shear bond strength of composite resin due to the residual oxygen. Different antioxidant agents may overcome this problem. PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess the effect of different antioxidants on the shear bond strength of composite resin to home-bleached. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Sixty extracted intact human incisors were embedded in cylindrical acrylic resin blocks (2.5×1.5 cm), with the coronal portion left out of the block. After bleaching the labial enamel surface with 15% carbamide peroxide, they were randomly divided into 6 groups (n=10). Before performing composite resin restoration by using a cylindrical Teflon mold (5×2 mm), each group was treated with one of the following antioxidants: 10% sodium ascorbate solution, 10% pomegranate peel solution, 10% grape seed extract, 5% green tea extract, and aloe vera leaf gel. One group was left untreated as the control. The shear bond strength of samples was tested under a universal testing machine (ZwickRoell Z020). The shear bond strength data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey tests (p< 0.05). RESULTS: No significant difference existed between the control and experimental groups. Moreover, there was no statistically significant difference between the effects of different antioxidants on the shear bond strength of bleached enamel. CONCLUSION: Different antioxidants used in this study had the same effect on the shear bond strength of home-bleached enamel, and none of them caused a statistically significant increase in its value.

26626817|t|Development and calibration of a dietary nitrate and nitrite database in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study.
26626817|a|OBJECTIVE: Nitrate and nitrite are probable human carcinogens when ingested under conditions that increase the formation of N-nitroso compounds. There have been limited efforts to develop US databases of dietary nitrate and nitrite for standard FFQ. Here we describe the development of a dietary nitrate and nitrite database and its calibration. DESIGN: We analysed data from a calibration study of 1942 members of the NIH-AARP (NIH-AARP, National Institutes of Health-AARP) Diet and Health Study who reported all foods and beverages consumed on the preceding day in two non-consecutive 24 h dietary recalls (24HR) and completed an FFQ. Based on a literature review, we developed a database of nitrate and nitrite contents for foods reported on these 24HR and for food category line items on the FFQ. We calculated daily nitrate and nitrite intakes for both instruments, and used a measurement error model to compute correlation coefficients and attenuation factors for the FFQ-based intake estimates using 24HR-based values as reference data. RESULTS: FFQ-based median nitrate intake was 68·9 and 74·1 mg/d, and nitrite intake was 1·3 and 1·0 mg/d, in men and women, respectively. These values were similar to 24HR-based intake estimates. Energy-adjusted correlation coefficients between FFQ- and 24HR-based values for men and women respectively were 0·59 and 0·57 for nitrate and 0·59 and 0·58 for nitrite; energy-adjusted attenuation factors were 0·59 and 0·57 for nitrate and 0·47 and 0·38 for nitrite. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of the FFQ in assessing dietary nitrate and nitrite intakes is comparable to that for many other macro- and micronutrients.

1251200|t|Human newborns differentiate differing concentrations of sucrose and glucose.
1251200|a|One- to three-day-old infants who sucked to obtain flavored water revealed a precisely graded tongue movement which was sensitive to the gustatory properties of the flavored water. Stronger concentrations of sucrose and glucose elicited movements of greater amplitude than did weaker concentrations; sucrose was effective at lower concentrations than was glucose. These results correspond well with the relative sweetness adults attribute to these solutions in psychophysical studies.

25074384|t|Inhibition of the intestinal sodium-coupled glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1) by extracts and polyphenols from apple reduces postprandial blood glucose levels in mice and humans.
25074384|a|SCOPE: There is a growing interest in food constituents that could reduce intestinal glucose absorption to prevent overshooting plasma glucose and insulin levels in patients with prediabetes and diabetes mellitus type 2. METHODS AND RESULTS: We here demonstrate that an extract and individual polyphenols from apple diminish sodium-coupled glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1) mediated glucose uptake in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of transport of sugars by SGLT1 was shown in Xenopus oocytes and in mice jejunal segments. Strongest inhibition was observed for phlorizin with IC50 values for transport inhibition of 0.46 ± 0.19 and 4.1 ± 0.6 μM in oocytes and intestinal segments, respectively. An oral glucose tolerance test performed in volunteers with prior administration of the apple extract reduced venous blood glucose and plasma insulin levels, similar to findings obtained in C57BL/6N mice. Analysis of human urine samples revealed that the extract increased modestly renal glucose loss that is most likely a result of inhibition of renal glucose reabsorption by phloretin derivatives found in plasma of the volunteers. CONCLUSION: Although the apple extract substantially decreased intestinal glucose absorption in all test systems, the finding that there are systemic effects that relate to inhibition of glucose transport processes beyond the intestine addresses safety issues that need further exploitation.

21356170|t|Therapeutic photobiomodulation: nitric oxide and a novel function of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase.
21356170|a|Currently, light therapies are widely used in both human and veterinarian medicine. The application of light to clinical therapeutics includes: photodynamic therapy, used to kill cancer cells; UVA therapies, used to treat a variety of skin diseases; and photobiomodulation, used to promote cell growth and recovery from injury. Photobiomodu-lation uses light emitting diodes (LEDs) or low energy lasers, which emit light in the visible red to near infrared range. Light in this range penetrates tissue reasonably well, lacks the carcinogenic/mutagenic properties of UV light, and acts on an endogenous photoreceptor which likely acts to initiate light-altered signaling pathways. Although early studies identified mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase as an endogenous photoreceptor for photobiomodulation, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying photobiomodulation have not been clear. Three recent findings provide important new insight. First, nitric oxide has been implicated. Second, cytochrome c oxidase, an enzyme known to reduce oxygen to water at the end of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, has been shown to have a new enzymatic activity--the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide. This nitrite reductase activity is elevated under hypoxic conditions but also occurs under normoxia. And third, low intensity light enhances nitric oxide synthesis by cytochrome c oxidase without altering its ability to reduce oxygen. From these findings, we propose that cytochrome c oxidase functions in photobiomodulation by producing nitric oxide, a signaling molecule which can then function in both intra- and extracellular signaling pathways. We also propose that the effectiveness of photobiomodulation is under the control of tissue oxygen and nitrite levels.

19902259|t|Novel conditionally immortalized human proximal tubule cell line expressing functional influx and efflux transporters.
19902259|a|Reabsorption of filtered solutes from the glomerular filtrate and excretion of waste products and xenobiotics are the main functions of the renal proximal tubular (PT) epithelium. A human PT cell line expressing a range of functional transporters would help to augment current knowledge in renal physiology and pharmacology. We have established and characterized a conditionally immortalized PT epithelial cell line (ciPTEC) obtained by transfecting and subcloning cells exfoliated in the urine of a healthy volunteer. The PT origin of this line has been confirmed morphologically and by the expression of aminopeptidase N, zona occludens 1, aquaporin 1, dipeptidyl peptidase IV and multidrug resistance protein 4 together with alkaline phosphatase activity. ciPTEC assembles in a tight monolayer with limited diffusion of inulin-fluorescein-isothiocyanate. Concentration and time-dependent reabsorption of albumin via endocytosis has been demonstrated, together with sodium-dependent phosphate uptake. The expression and activity of apical efflux transporter p-glycoprotein and of baso-lateral influx transporter organic cation transporter 2 have been shown in ciPTEC. This established human ciPTEC expressing multiple endogenous organic ion transporters mimicking renal reabsorption and excretion represents a powerful tool for future in vitro transport studies in pharmacology and physiology.

1999695|t|Electroencephalographic mapping during isoflurane anesthesia for treatment of mental depression.
1999695|a|Seven patients undergoing isoflurane anesthesia were studied using electroencephalographic (EEG) mapping, a computer-assisted technique of EEG processing that permits the analysis of the spatial distribution of frequency components of the human EEG. After induction with thiopental, the patients were hyperventilated (carbon dioxide tension, 25 to 28 mm Hg) with 4% isoflurane in oxygen until a burst-suppression EEG appeared. Brain electrical activity was compared before anesthesia, at 0.5 to 0.8% and 1.8 to 2.1% isoflurane, during bursts, and after anesthesia. Starting from an alpha EEG with occipital predominance, a distinct alpha activation appeared over the whole cortex during 0.5 to 0.8% isoflurane. Decreased alpha amplitude with a maximum over the frontotemporal regions was observed during 1.8 to 2.1% isoflurane. Bursts consisted of high amplitude in all frequency bands. In the delta and the theta bands, voltage was very low before isoflurane administration, and increased in relation to depth of anesthesia. A minimum in delta and theta amplitudes occurred over both central regions. The dominant frequency, defined as the frequency component with the highest amplitude in the frequency spectrum, decreased from 8 to 4 and finally to 1 Hz, while its amplitude increased from 3 to 13 microV. As anesthesia deepened, the dominant frequency shifted from the occiput to the frontal cortex. Brain mapping transfers an immense amount of electroencephalographic (EEG) data into a comprehensive, easily readable image of brain function during anesthesia for therapy of mental depression. To make use of this technique in the operating room, further investigation and development toward on-line mapping are necessary.

11547351|t|Proton- and sodium-coupled phosphate transport systems and energy status of Yarrowia lipolytica cells grown in acidic and alkaline conditions.
11547351|a|In this study we have used a newly isolated Yarrowia lipolytica yeast strain with a unique capacity to grow over a wide pH range (3.5-10.5), which makes it an excellent model system for studying H(+)- and Na(+)-coupled phosphate transport systems. Even at extreme growth conditions (low concentrations of extracellular phosphate, alkaline pH values) Y. lipolytica preserved tightly-coupled mitochondria with the fully competent respiratory chain containing three points of energy conservation. This was demonstrated for the first time for cells grown at pH 9.5-10.0. In cells grown at pH 4.5, inorganic phosphate (P(i)) was accumulated by two kinetically discrete H(+)/P(i)-cotransport systems. The low-affinity system is most likely constitutively expressed and operates at high P(i) concentrations. The high-affinity system, subjected to regulation by both extracellular P(i) availability and intracellular polyphosphate stores, is mobilized during P(i)-starvation. In cells grown at pH 9.5-10, P(i) uptake is mediated by several kinetically discrete Na(+)-dependent systems that are specifically activated by Na(+) ions and insensitive to the protonophore CCCP. One of these, a low-affinity transporter operative at high P(i) concentrations is kinetically characterized here for the first time. The other two, high-affinity, high-capacity systems, are derepressible and functional during P(i)-starvation and appear to be controlled by extracellular P(i). They represent the first examples of high-capacity, Na(+)-driven P(i) transport systems in an organism belonging to neither the animal nor bacterial kingdoms. The contribution of the H(+)- and Na(+)-coupled P(i) transport systems in Y. lipolytica cells grown at different pH values was quantified. In cells grown at pH values of 4.5 and 6.0, the H(+)-coupled P(i) transport systems are predominant. The contribution of the Na(+)/P(i) cotransport systems to the total cellular P(i) uptake activity is progressively increased with increasing pH, reaching its maximum at pH 9 and higher.

2548600|t|Effects of temperature and glycerol on the resonance Raman spectra of cytochrome c peroxidase and selected mutants.
2548600|a|The high-frequency resonance Raman spectra of FeIII yeast native cytochrome c peroxidase (CCP) and five of its mutants [CCP(MI), Phe-51, Leu-48, Lys-48, Asn-235, and Phe-191] were recorded in phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and in glycerol/phosphate mixtures at 295 and 10 K. Glycerol induces heme coordination changes in some of the CCP mutants at room temperature. It apparently weakens the binding of the Fe atom to ligands in the distal heme cavity and drives the heme toward the 5-coordinate, high-spin state. At 10 K, native CCP and all the mutants (except Phe-51 which remains 6-coordinate, high-spin) show various distributions of spin and coordination states which differ from those observed at 295 K. Upon cooling in phosphate buffer, pH 7, and to a much lesser extent in 66% glycerol/phosphate, an internal strong-field ligand is coordinated to the Fe. A likely candidate is H2O-595, which could become a strong-field ligand on H-bonding and/or proton transfer to H2O-648, and/or the distal His-52. However, distal His-52 itself cannot be ruled out as the coordinating ligand considering that the Phe-51 mutant, which binds H2O-595 at room temperature, does not show a large 6-coordinate, low-spin component at 10 K like the other mutants. These results clearly indicate that the Fe coordination in CCP and its mutants is sensitive to both temperature and solvent composition.

14518269|t|[Nitrogen monoxide and oxygen radicals work contrarily on proliferation behavior of human fibroblasts].
14518269|a|Oxygen radicals and nitric oxide are involved in a variety of regulative processes especially with regard to inflammation, immunoregulation and regulation of the vascular tone. The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of both these highly reactive molecules on the proliferation of human fibroblasts. We therefore cultured WI38 cells under various culture conditions like exposure to oxygen radicals and endogenously produced as well as exogenously applied nitric oxide. Exposure of WI38 to oxygen radicals led to a reduction of cell proliferation. Similarly induction of endogenous nitric oxide production by cytokines induced an inhibition in cell proliferation. Interestingly exogenously applied nitric oxide increased proliferation rates of WI38 cells. These data could point to a functional role of oxygen radicals and nitric oxide in the regulation of fibroblast growth.

12940440|t|Validation of microdialysis probes for studying nitrosative chemistry within localized regions of the human upper gastrointestinal tract.
12940440|a|BACKGROUND: We have examined the suitability of microdialysis probes for examining nitrosative chemistry within localized regions of the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract. Chemical nitrosation occurs maximally at pH 2.5 in the presence of nitrite and thiocyanate and absence of ascorbic acid. Nitrite and thiocyanate are delivered into the stomach in saliva and ascorbic acid is secreted in gastric juice. METHODS: We used a benchtop model to reproduce the nitrosative chemistry occurring in the human upper GI tract and assessed the ability of the microdialysis probes to measure it. RESULTS: The microdialysis probes were reliable at measuring nitrite ascorbic acid, total vitamin C and thiocyanate in both aqueous solutions and human gastric juice over the full range of intragastric pH, i.e. 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5.0 and 7.0. The probes were also reliable at measuring these chemicals under conditions simulating the active interaction between nitrite and ascorbic acid. Under such conditions with ascorbic acid in excess the probes gave a more accurate assessment of the nitrite level than that obtained by directly sampling the gastric juice. This was due to the probes not being subject to artefactual measurement of nitric oxide as nitrite. This was prevented by the rapid diffusion of nitric oxide through the probe collecting tube. CONCLUSION: Microdialysis probes provide a reliable means of examining nitrosative chemistry within the lumen of the upper GI tract. In addition, they have the advantage of measuring this chemistry in very local regions and of simultaneously comparing the chemistry in different regions of the upper GI tract.

17611701|t|Activation of polyamine catabolism by N1,N11-diethylnorspermine leads to cell death in glioblastoma.
17611701|a|Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most therapeutically refractory human cancers. Elevated cellular polyamine levels are a common feature of cancer cells, including GBM cells, and the polyamine pathway has been explored as a potential therapeutic target to inhibit polyamine biosynthesis or activate polyamine catabolism. In this study, we investigated the effect of N1,N11-diethyl-norspermine (DENSPM), a spermine analog that activates polyamine catabolism, in GBM cells. The in vitro cell culture experiments showed that DENSPM increased the sub-G1 apoptotic cell population in GBM cell lines but caused minimal cytotoxicity in normal astrocytes. Prior to apoptosis induction, DENSPM caused the elevation of spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) expression accompanied by a decrease in polyamine levels and an increase of acetylated polyamine levels, which temporally coincided with the onset of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induction in the cells. The cytotoxic effects of DENSPM in the GBM cells could be partially attenuated by either turning down SSAT mRNA with small interference RNA or inhibiting H2O2 production with N1-acetylpolymine oxidase (APAO)/spermine oxidase (SMO) inhibitor. Though mitochondrial damage was induced, neither activation of the caspase cascade nor cytochrome c redistribution between the mitochondria and cytoplasm was observed. Systemic DENSPM treatment of mice with intracerebral GBM led to longer survival. Taken together, our studies indicate that DENSPM kills GBM cells through induction of SSAT coupled with H2O2 production, which is a potential target for GBM therapy.

15273777|t|Induction of NO-synthase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase in neurons of human cerebellar cortex during chronic alcohol intoxication.
15273777|a|Induction of NO-synthase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase in Purkinje cells, basket-like neurons, and microvascular endothelium of human cerebellar cortex was detected in patients with chronic alcohol intoxication. It was hypothesized that the neuromodulating effect of NO is associated with mechanisms protecting neurons from toxic effects of ethanol and acetaldehyde.

2617739|t|[The adenosine phosphate content in human sperm and their motility].
2617739|a|Adenosine phosphoric acids (ATP, ADP, AMP) are of significance for the metabolic processes in living beings, including spermatozoa, as they are the principal donors of energy in all the reactions of biosynthesis. Besides, spermatozoa need the energy to perform a particular function-to move in the female genital tract to the ovum. It was stated that a decrease in the ATP levels reduced or ceased the translational motion of spermatozoa, therefore the investigations of adenosine phosphates in the spermatozoa were found to be mandatory. The authors studied the levels of ATP, ADP and AMP and the energy charge in the native human spermatozoa in the patients with oligo- and asthenospermia. Spermatozoa with morphologically and physiologically normal fertility were used as controls. The results obtained demonstrated that in oligospermic males the levels of ATP were slightly decreased whereas the levels of AMP significantly increased from 31.6 to 38 per cent. As a result there was a significant decrease in the ATP/ADP ratio. A more pronounced decrease in the ATP levels and an increase in the AMP levels were revealed in asthenospermic patients (12.6 and 40.5 per cent respectively. In the latter patients the ADP fraction decreased to 42.4 per cent versus 51.4 per cent in health and the energy charge underwent a more significant decrease: from 0.37 (normal) to 0.3. The results obtained are indicative of the possibility of using the aforementioned method for a comprehensive evaluation of the spermatozoan functional activity and the detection of asthenospermia-inducing mechanisms.

6373495|t|A suppressor of SNF1 mutations causes constitutive high-level invertase synthesis in yeast.
6373495|a|The SNF1 gene product of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is required to derepress expression of many glucose-repressible genes, including the SUC2 structural gene for invertase. Strains carrying a recessive snf1 mutation are unable to ferment sucrose. We have isolated 30 partial phenotypic revertants of a snf1 mutant that were able to ferment sucrose. Genetic characterization of these revertants showed that the suppressor mutations were all recessive and defined eight complementation groups, designated ssn1 through ssn8 (suppressor of snf1 ). The revertants were assayed for secreted invertase activity, and although activity was detected in members of each complementation group, only the ssn6 strains contained wild-type levels. Synthesis of secreted invertase in ssn6 strains was found to be constitutive, that is, insensitive to glucose repression; moreover, the ssn6 mutations also conferred constitutivity in a wild-type ( SNF1 ) genetic background and are, therefore, not merely suppressors of snf1 . Pleiotropic defects were observed in ssn6 mutants. Genetic analysis suggested that the ssn6 mutations are allelic to the cyc8 mutation isolated by R. J. Rothstein and F. Sherman, which causes increased production of iso-2-cytochrome c. The data suggest a regulatory function for SSN6 .

9693068|t|Expression, purification, and characterization of Sss1p, an essential component of the yeast Sec61p protein translocation complex.
9693068|a|Sss1p, a 8.9-kDa membrane protein, is an essential component of the protein translocation complex involved in the transport of secretory proteins across the Saccharomyces cerevisiae endoplasmic reticulum membrane. In order to determine the high resolution structure of Sss1p by NMR, we have undertaken its overexpression and purification. We first inserted the yeast SSS1 gene into the pGEX-2T plasmid expression vector. Sss1p was expressed as fusions with Schistosoma japonica glutathione S-transferase (GST-Sss1p) in MC1061 Escherichia coli cells. Maximum yield of GST-Sss1p was obtained from cells harvested 2 h after induction at 37 degreesC in Luria broth medium. GST-Sss1p was found associated predominantly with the membrane pool and was readily extracted with Triton X-100. Detergent-solubilized GST-Sss1p was isolated by adsorption on glutathione-agarose beads. Sss1p was released from its GST carrier by cleavage with thrombin and its recovery was maximized by addition of dodecyl maltoside. Desorbed Sss1p was loaded on a high-performance liquid chromatography hydroxyapatite column equilibrated in phosphate buffer supplemented with dodecyl maltoside and the fractions containing Sss1p were subsequently purified to homogeneity by reverse-phase chromatography on a C4 column. The entire purification protocol can be completed in 5-6 h and yields about 0.4 mg of Sss1p per gram of transformed cells. CD and preliminary 1H NMR experiments show that purified Sss1p solubilized in SDS micelles is very stable and adopts a helical secondary structure.

11284771|t|Iron and inflammatory bowel disease.
11284771|a|Both anaemia of iron deficiency and anaemia of chronic disease are frequently encountered in inflammatory bowel disease. Anaemia of iron deficiency is mostly due to inadequate intake or loss of iron. Anaemia of chronic disease probably results from decreased erythropoiesis, secondary to increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen metabolites and nitric oxide. Assessment of the iron status in a condition associated with inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease, is difficult. The combination of serum transferrin receptor with ferritin concentrations, however, allows a reliable assessment of the iron deficit. The best treatment for anaemia of chronic disease is the cure of the underlying disease. Erythropoietin reportedly may increase haemoglobin levels in some of these patients. The anaemia of iron deficiency is usually treated with oral iron supplements. Iron supplementation may lead to an increased inflammatory activity through the generation of reactive oxygen species. To date, data from studies in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease support the theoretical disadvantage of iron supplementation in this respect. The results, however, cannot easily be extrapolated to the human situation, because the amount of supplemented iron in these experiments was much higher than the dose used in patients with iron deficiency.

24788541|t|Up-regulating CYP3A4 expression in C3A cells by transfection with a novel chimeric regulator of hPXR-p53-AD.
24788541|a|Most hepatoma cell lines lack proper expression and induction of CYP3A4 enzyme, which limits their use for predicting drug metabolism and toxicity. Nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor (PXR) has been well recognized for its critical role in regulating expression of CYP3A4 gene. However, its physiological activity of binding to the particular site of promoter is significantly weakened in hepatic cell lines. To address this problem, we created "chimeric PXR" constructs by appending a strong activation domain (AD) from p53 subunit to either N- or C- termini of the human PXR (hPXR), that is, hPXR-p53 and p53-hPXR. C3A, a hepatoma cell line, was used as the cell model to test the regulation effect of chimeric hPXR over wild type (WT) hPXR on CYP3A4 expression at gene, protein, and metabolism levels, respectively. Compared with C3A cells transiently transfected with WT hPXR, the activity of CYP3A4.XREM.luc reporter gene in C3A cells transfected with hPXR-p53 or p53-hPXR increased 5- and 9-fold respectively, and the levels of CYP3A4 mRNA expression increased 3.5- and 2.6-fold, respectively. C3A cells stably transfected with hPXR-p53-AD exhibited an improved expression of CYP3A4 at both gene (2-fold) and protein (1.5-fold) levels compared to WT C3A cells. Testosterone, a CYP3A4-specific substrate, was used for detecting the metabolism activity of CYP3A4. No testosterone metabolite could be detected in microsomes from WT C3A cells and WT C3A cells-based array, while the formation of 6β-hydroxytestosterone metabolite in the transfected cells was 714 and 55 pmol/mg protein/min, respectively. In addition, all the above expression levels in the transfected cell models could be further induced with additional treatment of Rifampicin, a specific inducer for CYP3A4. In conclusion, our study established a proof-of-principle example that genetic modification with chimeric hPXR-p53-AD could improve CYP3A4 metabolism ability in hepatic cell line.

21670104|t|Functional interaction between trace amine-associated receptor 1 and dopamine D2 receptor.
21670104|a|The ability of dopamine receptors to interact with other receptor subtypes may provide mechanisms for modulating dopamine-related functions and behaviors. In particular, there is evidence suggesting that the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) affects the dopaminergic system by regulating the firing rate of dopaminergic neurons or by altering dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) responsiveness to ligands. TAAR1 is a Gα(s) protein-coupled receptor that is activated by biogenic amines, "trace amines," such as β-phenylethylamine (β-PEA) and tyramine that are normally found at low concentrations in the mammalian brain. In the present study, we investigated the biochemical mechanism of interaction between TAAR1 and D2R and the role this interaction plays in D2R-related signaling and behaviors. Using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer biosensor for cAMP, we demonstrated that the D2R antagonists haloperidol, raclopride, and amisulpride were able to enhance selectively a TAAR1-mediated β-PEA increase of cAMP. Moreover, TAAR1 and D2R were able to form heterodimers when coexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and this direct interaction was disrupted in the presence of haloperidol. In addition, in mice lacking TAAR1, haloperidol-induced striatal c-Fos expression and catalepsy were significantly reduced. Taken together, these data suggest that TAAR1 and D2R have functional and physical interactions that could be critical for the modulation of the dopaminergic system by TAAR1 in vivo.

14685765|t|Regulation of glycolysis in Kluyveromyces lactis: role of KlGCR1 and KlGCR2 in glucose uptake and catabolism.
14685765|a|In Kluyveromyces lactis, the casein kinase I (Rag8p) regulates the transcription of glycolytic genes and the expression of the low-affinity glucose transporter gene RAG1. This control involves the transcription factor Sck1p, a homologue of Sgc1p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. SGC1 is known to interact genetically with ScGCR1 and ScGCR2, which code for regulators of glycolytic gene expression. Therefore, we studied the role of KlGCR1 and KlGCR2 genes in K. lactis. The Klgcr1 null mutant could not grow on glucose when respiration was blocked by antimycin A (Rag(- )phenotype). In contrast, the Klgcr2 null mutant could grow under the same conditions, although at a reduced rate. In both mutants, the transcription of glycolytic genes was affected, while that of ribosomal protein genes was not modified. Furthermore, the transcription of the glucose permease genes was also found to be affected in the two mutants, although dissimilarly. While RAG1 transcription decreased at high glucose concentrations, the expression of the high-affinity glucose permease gene HGT1 was unexpectedly impaired under gluconeogenic conditions, in the absence of glucose. Gel mobility shift assays performed with purified maltose-binding protein-KlGcr1p showed that KlGcr1p could interact directly with the promoters of the glycolytic genes, but not with the promoters of the glucose permease genes. Thus, the control exerted by KlGcr1p and KlGcr2p upon glucose transporter genes is probably indirect.

9176832|t|Conflicting indicators of biotin status from a cross-sectional study of normal pregnancy.
9176832|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess biotin nutritional status during normal human gestation. METHODS: Urine samples were obtained in a cross-sectional design from 16 women in early pregnancy (17 +/- 1 weeks, mean +/- 1 SD) and from 13 women in late pregnancy (36 +/- 1 weeks). The urinary excretion of biotin, two metabolites bisnorbiotin (BNB) and biotin sulfoxide (BSO), and the organic acid 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid (3-HIA) were measured by HPLC/avidin-binding assay and GC/MS, respectively. Excretion rates were expressed as concentration ratios to urinary creatinine. RESULTS: In both early and late pregnancy, 3-HIA excretion was increased compared to controls (p < 0.0001), suggesting decreased activity of a biotin-dependent enzyme caused by tissue biotin depletion. In early pregnancy, urinary excretion of biotin was normal; in late pregnancy, excretion was increased (p < 0.0002), suggesting biotin status was not decreased. In late pregnancy, urinary excretion of BNB and BSO were increased (p < 0.009). CONCLUSION: The apparent conflict in the indices of biotin status is not explained by this study but could be resolved by two alternate explanations: 1) Pregnancy caused an impairment of renal reclamation of biotin, BNB, and BSO leading to a paradoxical increase in biotin excretion 2) Pregnancy caused metabolic or renal effects that increased 3-HIA excretion nonspecifically; hence, the increased 3-HIA excretion did not reflect biotin deficiency. We speculate that some of the women studied were marginally biotin deficient and that renal wasting and accelerated breakdown of biotin contributed to the deficiency.

2441144|t|17 beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in the human prostate: properties and distribution between epithelium and stroma in benign hyperplastic tissue.
2441144|a|In order to delineate differences in the mechanism of androgen action in epithelium (E) and stroma (S) of the human prostate, we studied the 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17 beta-HSDH) in these tissues of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Tissue was obtained by suprapubic prostatectomy. E and S were separated; samples were homogenized in buffer and incubated with [3H] steroids (4-androstenedione (Ae), estrone (E1), or dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA] and NADH (4.2 mmol/l) as cosubstrate for 60 min at 37 degrees C. Separation and quantification of the metabolites were performed by TLC and LSC, respectively. The main results were: (1) Following incubation with DHEA and E1, only the metabolites 5-androstene-3 beta,17 beta-diol and estradiol, respectively, were found. Following incubation with Ae, testosterone, 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone and 5 alpha-androstane-3 alpha-(beta),17 beta-diol were detected as metabolites (the sum of these metabolites were used for calculations). (2) The Michaelis constants were identical in E and S (mean +/- SEM (n), mumol/l, Ae 6.92 +/- 1.01, E1 7.84 +/- 0.69, DHEA 3.73 +/- 0.38). (3) The maximum velocity rate for the three substrates in E was 5-10-fold that in S (P at least less than 0.01), the value in the whole tissue homogenate (WT) being intermediate (pmol/mg protein h), for Ae: E 383 +/- 56, S 40 +/- 3, WT 75 +/- 13; for E1: E 362 +/- 71, S 33 +/- 4, WT 63 +/- 8; for DHEA: E 132 +/- 21, S 26 +/- 4, WT 36 +/- 4. On the basis of these results the role of 17 beta-HSDH in forming active androgens and estrogens from less potent precursors is discussed in the stromal and epithelial compartment of the human prostate.

3073355|t|Human tolerability and pharmacodynamic study of Tisacid tablet in duodenal ulcer patients. A prospective, randomized, self-controlled clinicopharmacological study.
3073355|a|A randomized, prospective, crossing-over clinico-pharmacological study was conducted on the tolerability by humans, of TISACID (Al-Mg-hydroxy-carbonate), a new antacid of up-to-date composition produced in Hungary. Even a relatively high dose of the preparation is tolerated by the human organism. During a 6-week continuous treatment neither subjective nor objective side-effects were observed. The tablet is immediately decomposed in the gastric juice, a considerable portion of it will permanently stick to the mucosa of the stomach and duodenum. Depending on the dose, it rapidly and permanently reduces the acidity of the gastric content and increases serum gastrin concentration only moderately and for a short time. Administered together with cimetidine, it promotes healing of duodenal ulcer and the cessation of complaints. It does not increase the aluminium and magnesium concentrations of the plasma not even on prolonged administration, and clinical symptoms and laboratory changes characterizing the phosphate depletion syndrome do not develop either. Based on the results, authors consider Tisacid a beneficial preparation as regards both effectivity and tolerability.

15981712|t|Novel properties of a mouse gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter (GAT4).
15981712|a|We expressed the mouse gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter GAT4 (homologous to rat/ human GAT-3) in Xenopus laevis oocytes and examined its functional and pharmacological properties by using electrophysiological and tracer uptake methods. In the coupled mode of transport (Na+/ Cl-/GABA cotransport), there was tight coupling between charge flux and GABA flux across the plasma membrane (2 charges/GABA). Transport was highly temperature-dependent with a temperature coefficient (Q10) of 4.3. The GAT4 turnover rate (1.5 s(-l); -50 mV, 21 degrees C) and temperature dependence suggest physiological turnover rates of 15-20 s(-1). No uncoupled current was observed in the presence of Na+. In the absence of external Na+, GAT4 exhibited two distinct uncoupled currents. (i) A Cl- leak current (ICl(leak)) was observed when Na+ was replaced with choline or tetraethylammonium. The reversal potential of (ICl(leak)) followed the Cl- Nernst potential. (ii) A Li+ leak current (ILi(leak)) was observed when Na+ was replaced with Li+. Both leak currents were inhibited by Na+, and both were temperature-independent (Q10 approximately 1). The two leak modes appeared not to coexist, as Li+ inhibited (ICl(leak)). The results suggest the existence of cation- and anion-selective channel-like pathways in GAT4. Flufenamic acid inhibited GAT4 Na+/Cl-/GABA cotransport, ILi(leak), and ICl(leak), (Ki approximately 30 microM), and the voltage-induced presteady-state charge movements (Ki approximately 440 microM). Flufenamic acid exhibited little or no selectivity for GAT1, GAT2, or GAT3. Sodium and GABA concentration jicroumps revealed that slow Na+ binding to the transporter is followed by rapid GABA-induced translocation of the ligands across the plasma membrane. Thus, Na+ binding and associated conformational changes constitute the rate-limiting steps in the transport cycle.

28304352|t|In Vitro Anti-Inflammatory and Cytotoxic Effects of Aqueous Extracts from the Edible Sea Anemones Anemonia sulcata and Actinia equina.
28304352|a|, were studied by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection (HPLC-DAD) and its impact upon immune and gastric cells was evaluated. In both species, the methylpyridinium alkaloid homarine was the major compound in aqueous extracts. The extracts were effective in reducing lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced levels of nitric oxide (NO) and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a macrophage model of inflammation. Both the extracts and the alkaloid homarine were effective in inhibiting phospholipase A₂ (PLA₂), a pivotal enzyme in the initial steps of the inflammatory cascade. In order to mimic the oral consumption of these extracts; their effect upon human gastric cells was evaluated. While no caspase-9 activation was detected, the fact that the endoplasmic reticulum-resident caspase-4, and also caspase-3, were activated points to a non-classical mechanism of apoptosis in human gastric cells. This work provides new insights on the toxicity and biological potential of sea anemones increasingly present in human nutrition.

9197243|t|Cell growth inhibition by the Mad/Max complex through recruitment of histone deacetylase activity.
9197243|a|BACKGROUND: The organization of chromatin is crucial for the regulation of gene expression. In particular, both the positioning and properties of nucleosomes influence promoter-specific transcription. The acetylation of core histones has been suggested to alter the properties of nucleosomes and affect the access of DNA-binding transcriptional regulators to promoters. A recently identified mammalian histone deacetylase (HD1) shows homology to the yeast Rpd3 protein, which together with Sin3 affects the transcription of several genes. Mammalian Sin3 proteins interact with the Mad components of the Myc/Max/Mad network of cell growth regulators. Mad/Max complexes may recruit mammalian Rpd3-like enzymes, therefore, directing histone deacetylase activity to promoters and negatively regulating cell growth. RESULTS: We report the identification of a tetrameric complex composed of Max, Mad1, Sin3B and HD1. This complex has histone deacetylase activity which can be blocked by the histone deacetylase inhibitors trichostatin A and sodium butyrate. The inhibition of cell growth by Mad1 is enhanced by Sin3B and HD1, as measured by colony formation assays. Furthermore, a Mad1-induced block of S-phase progression can be overcome by trichostatin A, as shown in microinjection experiments. CONCLUSIONS: The recruitment of a histone deacetylase by sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins provides a mechanism by which the state of acetylation of histones in nucleosomes and hence the activity of specific promoters can be influenced. The finding that Mad/Max complexes interact with Sin3 and HD1 in vivo suggests a model for the role of Mad proteins in antagonizing the function of Myc proteins.

28739528|t|Chronic hyper-leptinemia induces insulin signaling disruption in adipocytes: Implications of NOS2.
28739528|a|Leptin, following its discovery, has developed a formidable interest in the scientific community to delineate its contribution towards overall metabolic homeostasis. Contradictory reports have been published on leptin administration effects on whole body insulin sensitivity. Following late reports, we surveyed human serum leptin levels along with other metabolic parameters including BMI and HOMA-IR. We found a positive correlation between leptin levels and insulin resistance parameters. Considering the presence of the long form of leptin receptor on adipocytes, we explored the effects of chronic physiological hyper-leptinemic exposure on adipocyte insulin sensitivity. Chronic leptin (50ng/ml) treatment in 3T3-L1 adipocytes decreased insulin-induced phosphorylation of nodal insulin signaling proteins along with reduced glucose uptake. Metabolic flux studies indicated mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced oxygen consumption rate. Leptin treatment also increased both cellular and mitochondrial superoxide levels concomitant to increased expression of nitric oxide synthase-2 (NOS2). Further, pharmacological depletion of NOS2 reversed leptin mediated effects on insulin signaling. In-vivo implantation of leptin osmotic pumps in C57BL/6 mice also decreased insulin responsiveness. Interestingly, these effects were lacking in NOS2 knockout strain. In conclusion, our studies put forward a potential link between leptin and adipocyte insulin responsiveness in an NOS2 dependent manner.

8702551|t|Manganese superoxide dismutase modulates interleukin-1alpha levels in HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells.
8702551|a|Reactive oxygen species of mitochondrial origin have been implicated in regulating the expression of several tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced genes. Manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) is one of many genes, but only antioxidant enzyme, induced in response to tumor necrosis factor. Mn-SOD is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial matrix protein and serves a protective function by detoxifying superoxide. To address the role of superoxide in regulating gene expression in response to TNF, we have constitutively overexpressed Mn-SOD in a human fibrosarcoma cell line and asked what effect this has on the expression of a number of TNF-responsive genes using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Of the TNF-induced transcripts analyzed, only interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha) was modulated in response to Mn-SOD overexpression. In all cases of Mn-SOD overexpression, IL-1alpha protein and mRNA levels were lowered constitutively and in response to TNF when compared to the parental and mock-transfected cell lines. The induction of IL-1alpha by TNF can also be decreased by growth in 3% oxygen as compared to growth in 21% O2; in addition, growth in low oxygen lowers the basal level of IL-1alpha protein. The effect of Mn-SOD overexpression on IL-1alpha expression can be overcome by treatment with the protein kinase C activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Mn-SOD overexpression and low oxygen alter IL-1alpha mRNA levels by decreasing the stability of the IL-1alpha mRNA. These findings indicate that both Mn-SOD and O2 may regulate the levels of a cellular oxidant involved in both basal and TNF-induced IL-1alpha expression, presumably superoxide.

2007178|t|Metabolic changes in LDL receptors and an appearance of scavenger receptors after phorbol ester-induced differentiation of U937 cells.
2007178|a|Metabolic changes in lipoprotein receptors after cell differentiation were investigated using U937 cells, a human tumor cell line with monoblastic characteristics. After inducing the differentiation of U937 cells into monocyte-macrophage-like cells using TPA (12-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate), the incorpotation of [14C]oleate into cellular cholesteryl [14C]oleate was increased in comparison with U937 cells when incubated with r-beta VLDL, h-VLDL or h-LDL. A marked down-regulation of LDL receptors was observed in U937 cells upon addition of 25-hydroxycholesterol. However, this down-regulation of LDL receptors was poor in monocyte-macrophage-like cells that had been induced to differentiate from U937 cells with TPA. Acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase activity was increased after TPA-induced differentiation of U-937 cells. The incorporation of [14C]oleate into cellular cholesteryl [14C]oleate was also increased when incubated with acetylated h-LDL in monocyte-macrophage-like cells in comparison with U937 cells. These results suggest that a poor down-regulation of LDL receptors, which is attributable to increased acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase activity, and scavenger receptors are induced and that these metabolic changes in lipoprotein receptors and an increased acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase activity contribute to cholesterol ester accumulation in monocyte-macrophage-like cells.

10601927|t|Contractile activity, membrane potential, and cytoplasmic calcium in human uterine smooth muscle in the third trimester of pregnancy and during labor.
10601927|a|OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to investigate in human tissue samples the mechanisms underlying spontaneous and prostaglandin F(2)(alpha)-induced contractions during the final trimester of pregnancy and labor. STUDY DESIGN: Membrane potential and cytoplasmic calcium were recorded simultaneously with contraction in uterine strips obtained from the lower segment during cesarean delivery. RESULTS: Between week 28 of gestation and term there was a progressive increase in the frequency of spontaneous contractions and a decrease in the negative potential of the membrane. The response to prostaglandin F(2alpha) was biphasic. The initial excitatory component remained stable toward term. A later inhibitory component, which was underpinned by increased activity of the sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase pump, decreased at the time of labor. CONCLUSIONS: There is a gradual increase in excitability in uterine muscle throughout the third trimester of human pregnancy. The initial component of the prostaglandin response is a large contraction that is kept brief by a subsequent inhibitory component of the response, which ensures that full relaxation occurs between contractions.

25073461|t|Molecular properties of the high-affinity choline transporter CHT1.
25073461|a|This article summarizes molecular properties of the high-affinity choline transporter (CHT1) with reference to the historical background focusing studies performed in laboratories of the author. CHT1 is present on the presynaptic terminal of cholinergic neurons, and takes up choline which is the precursor of acetylcholine. The Na(+)-dependent uptake of choline by CHT1 is the rate-limiting step for synthesis of acetylcholine. CHT1 is the integral membrane protein with 13 transmembrane segments, belongs to the Na(+)/glucose co-transporter family (SLC5), and has 20-25% homology with members of this family. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for human CHT1 has been identified, which has a replacement from isoleucine to valine in the third transmembrane segment and shows the choline uptake activity of 50-60% as much as that of wild-type CHT1. The proportion of this SNP is high among Asians. Possible importance of choline diet for those with this SNP was discussed.

25200751|t|Crucial involvement of xanthine oxidase in the intracellular signalling networks associated with human myeloid cell function.
25200751|a|Xanthine oxidase (XOD) is an enzyme which plays a central role in purine catabolism by converting hypoxanthine into xanthine and then further into uric acid. Here we report that XOD is activated in THP-1 human myeloid cells in response to pro-inflammatory and growth factor stimulation. This effect occurred following stimulation of THP-1 cells with ligands of plasma membrane associated TLRs 2 and 4, endosomal TLRs 7 and 8 as well as stem cell growth factor (SCF). Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription complexes were found to be responsible for XOD upregulation. Importantly, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a major myeloid cell translation regulator, was also found to be essential for XOD activation. Specific inhibition of XOD by allopurinol and sodium tungstate led to an increase in intracellular AMP levels triggering downregulation of mTOR activation by phosphorylation of its T2446 residue. Taken together, our results demonstrate for the first time that XOD is not only activated by pro-inflammatory stimuli or SCF but also plays an important role in maintaining mTOR-dependent translational control during the biological responses of human myeloid cells.

24003327|t|Microleakage of CEM cement in two different media.
24003327|a|INTRODUCTION: Sealing ability of root-end filling materials is of great importance. It can be investigated by measuring microleakage. The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate microleakage of calcium enriched mixture (CEM) cement in two different media including phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and distilled water. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty single-rooted human teeth were selected. All teeth were root-end filled with CEM cement. Samples were divided into two groups of 10 each and were placed in PBS or distilled water. The microleakage was measured after 12 and 24 h, 14 and 30 days with Fluid Filtration device. Data were statistically analyzed by repeated measures test. RESULTS: Sealing ability of CEM cement was significantly superior in PBS compared to distilled water (P<0.05). This study also showed that time had no significant effect on the sealing ability of CEM cement. CONCLUSION: Media can significantly affect the microleakage of CEM cement. PBS can provide more phosphorous ions for hydroxyapatite formation of CEM cement; therefore, CEM cement can seal more effectively with PBS.

5016984|t|The effect of real and simulated time-zone shifts upon the circadian rhythms of body temperature, plasma 11-hydroxycorticosteroids, and renal excretion in human subjects.
5016984|a|1. Observations were made upon five subjects who flew through 4(1/2)-6 time zones, four of them returning later to their starting point, and upon twenty-three subjects experiencing simulated 6 or 8 hr time zones shifts in either direction in an isolation unit.2. Measurements were made of plasma concentration of 11-hydroxycorticosteroids, of body temperature, and of urinary excretion of sodium, potassium and chloride. Their rhythm was defined, where possible, by fitting a sine curve of period 24 hr to each separate 24-hr stretch of data and computing the acrophase, or maximum predicted by the sine curve.3. The adaptation of the plasma steroid rhythm was assessed by the presence of a sharp fall in concentration after the sample collected around 08.00 hr. The time course of adaptation varied widely between individuals; it was usually largely complete by the fourth day after westward, and rather later after eastward, flights. After time shift the pattern often corresponded neither to an adapted nor to an unadapted one, and in a subject followed for many months after a real flight a normal amplitude only appeared 2-3 months after flight.4. Temperature rhythm adapted by a movement of the acrophase, without change in amplitude, although on some days no rhythm could be observed. This movement was always substantial even on the first day, and was usually nearly complete by the fifth.5. High nocturnal excretion of electrolyte was often seen in the early days after time shift, more notably after simulated westward flights. Adaptation of urinary electrolyte rhythms usually proceeded as with temperature, but the movement of the acrophase was slower, more variable between individuals, more erratic, and sometimes reversed after partial adaptation. On a few days there were two maxima corresponding to those expected on real and on experimental time.6. Sodium excretion was much less regular than that of potassium, but adapted more rapidly to time shift, so that the two often became completely dissociated. Chloride behaved much as sodium.7. The time course of adaptation of the plasma steroid and urinary potassium rhythms were sufficiently similar to suggest a causal connexion. The time course of adaptation of the temperature rhythm did not coincide with that of any other component considered here.

25277952|t|Purinergic P2Y1 receptors take centre stage in autocrine stimulation of human beta cells.
25277952|a|Insulin secretory vesicles contain high concentrations of adenine nucleotides, which are co-released with insulin during exocytosis. There is strong evidence that ATP and ADP serve as autocrine messengers in pancreatic beta cells, but the functional effects and detailed mechanisms of action are under debate. In this issue of Diabetologia, Khan and colleagues (DOI: 10.1007/s00125-014-3368-8 ) present the results of their study of autocrine purinergic signalling in isolated human beta cells. Using a combination of electrophysiological techniques, Ca(2+) imaging and measurements of insulin secretion, it is demonstrated that voltage-dependent Ca(2+) influx triggers release of ATP/ADP, which activates purinergic receptors of the Gq/11-coupled P2Y1 isoform. Activation of these receptors leads to membrane depolarisation and phospholipase C-mediated mobilisation of Ca(2+) from endoplasmic reticulum stores, which amplifies the exocytosis-triggering Ca(2+) signal. In contrast, there is little evidence for involvement of ionotropic P2X receptors in the autocrine stimulation of human beta cells. This commentary discusses these findings as well as various functional and therapeutic implications of the complex purinergic signalling network in the pancreatic islet.

10509901|t|A new rapid method to detect inhibition of Amadori product generated by delta-gluconolactone.
10509901|a|Advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) have been implicated as a major pathogenic process in leading to diabetic complications. An increasing number of drug candidates have recently been developed as potential inhibitors of AGEs. Aminoguanidine, a hydrazine-like molecule is the first drug that was extensively studied both in vitro and in vivo as an inhibitor of AGE formation. Several assay methods have been proposed to determine the inhibitory effect of glycation inhibitors, including assays based on inhibition of specific fluorescence generated in the course of glycation and AGE-formation; assays based on the inhibition of AGE-protein crosslinks, and dimer and trimer formation; and specific ELISA assays using anti-AGE antibodies for quantitative measurement of AGEs in the presence and absence of the inhibitor. However, none of these assays can accurately evaluate chemical intermediates and products generated during the early stages of glycation. We have devised a new rapid assay method for evaluation of the early stage of glycation (Amadori product). This assay is based on the interaction of delta-gluconolactone (delta-Glu), an oxidized (ketoaldehyde) analogue of glucose, with hemoglobin present in blood samples. The assay involves determination of the percentage of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) after incubation at 37 degrees for 16 h with delta-Glu (50 mmol/L) using a dedicated ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. The results using normal human red blood cells show HbA1C levels to be 180% higher than baseline controls. The effects of various inhibitors are determined by measuring the levels of HbA1C by the compound in question compared to delta-Glu-treated vehicle only blood samples. This new assay provides a relevant and physiological model to study glycation and potential inhibitors. Furthermore, it offers a means to differentiate between inhibitors of the early and late stages of glycation and provides a rapid method of screening large numbers of potential inhibitors of glycation. Contrary to the assay methods, which are based on the measurement of fluorescence of fluorophores generated during glycation, the proposed assay does not suffer from the possible problem of overlapping and interference of AGE-specific fluorescence with the intrinsic fluorescence of the inhibitor compound.

26924495|t|Astaxanthin alleviates oxidative stress insults-related derangements in human vascular endothelial cells exposed to glucose fluctuations.
26924495|a|Glycemic fluctuations may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications, such as cardiovascular disease. We investigated whether the oxycarotenoid astaxanthin can reduce the detrimental effects of fluctuating glucose on vascular endothelial cells. Human umbilical venous endothelial cells were incubated for 3 days in media containing 5.5mM glucose, 22 mM glucose, or 5.5mM glucose alternating with 22 mM glucose in the absence or presence of astaxanthin or N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). Constant high glucose increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, but such an effect was more pronounced in fluctuating glucose. This was associated with up-regulated p22(phox) expression and down-regulated peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ coactivator (PGC-1α) expression. Astaxanthin inhibited ROS generation, p22(phox) up-regulation, and PGC-1α down-regulation by the stimuli of glucose fluctuation. Fluctuating glucose, but not constant high glucose, significantly decreased the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation level at Ser-1177 without affecting total eNOS expression, which was prevented by astaxanthin as well as by the anti-oxidant NAC. Transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) showed increased cell apoptosis in fluctuating glucose. Glucose fluctuation also resulted in up-regulating gene expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, interleukin-6 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1. These adverse changes were subdued by astaxanthin. The phosphorylation levels of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 were significantly increased by glucose fluctuations, and astaxanthin significantly inhibited the increase in JNK and p38 phosphorylation. Taken together, our results suggest that astaxanthin can protect vascular endothelial cells against glucose fluctuation by reducing ROS generation.

27888144|t|Calcifediol-loaded liposomes for local treatment of pulmonary bacterial infections.
27888144|a|The influence of vitamin D3 and its metabolites calcifediol (25(OH)D) and calcitriol on immune regulation and inflammation is well described, and raises the question of potential benefit against bacterial infections. In the current study, 25(OH)D was encapsulated in liposomes to enable aerosolisation, and tested for the ability to prevent pulmonary infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Prepared 25(OH)D-loaded liposomes were nanosized and monodisperse, with a negative surface charge and a 25(OH)D entrapment efficiency of approximately 23%. Jet nebulisation of liposomes was seen to yield an aerosol suitable for tracheo-bronchial deposition. Interestingly, 25(OH)D in either liposomes or ethanolic solution had no effect on the release of the proinflammatory cytokine KC from Pseudomonas-infected murine epithelial cells (LA-4); treatment of infected, human bronchial 16-HBE cells with 25(OH)D liposomes however resulted in a significant reduction in bacterial survival. Together with the importance of selecting an application-appropriate in vitro model, the current study illustrates the feasibility and practicality of employing liposomes as a means to achieve 25(OH)D lung deposition. 25(OH)D-loaded liposomes further demonstrated promising effects regarding prevention of Pseudomonas infection in human bronchial epithelial cells.

9592267|a|A total of 21 pulps were collected from 12 inflamed and 9 normal cases. SOD activity and MDA content were identified in the normal and inflamed pulpal tissues. In the inflamed pulpal tissues, SOD activity and MDA content were significantly increased than those in the normal tissues. The results demonstrated that the inflammation of pulpal tissues resulted in the increasing of the reactivity of superoxide radical and lipid peroxide (LPO). The results also indicated that human dental pulp possessed an endogenous defense mechanism to protect the tissue components from the toxic effects of the reactive oxygen intermediates.

26079963|a|AIM: Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is important to control reactive oxygen species, but the relevance to human disease like coronary artery disease (CAD) and underlying ischemia/reperfusion injury is not clarified. METHODS: For this study, 2239 patients with known CAD were prospectively followed with a median follow-up time period of 3.6 years and a maximum of 6.9 years. During follow-up cardiovascular death was reported in 103 cases. RESULTS: SOD activity (log-transformed) was investigated as continuous and categorical variable, showing a significant influence on outcome in the fully adjusted model (p = 0.045). CONCLUSION: Increased SOD activity beyond the normal range in the human physiology is related to an adverse outcome in patients with CAD.

8737283|t|Activation of NMDA receptor-channels in human retinal Müller glial cells inhibits inward-rectifying potassium currents.
8737283|a|Although it is well known that neurotransmitters mediate neuron-to-neuron communication, it is becoming clear that neurotransmitters also affect glial cells. However, knowledge of neuron-to-glial signalling is limited. In this study, we examined the effects of the glutamate agonist N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) on Müller cells, the predominant glia of the retina. Our immunocytochemical studies and immunodetection by Western blotting with monoclonal antibodies specific for the NMDAR1 subunit provided evidence for the expression by human Müller cells of this essential component of NMDA receptor-channels. Under conditions in which potassium currents were blocked, NMDA-induced currents could be detected in perforated-patch recordings from cultured and freshly dissociated human Müller cells. These currents were inhibited by competitive and non-competitive blockers of NMDA receptor-channels. Extracellular magnesium reduced the NMDA-activated currents in a voltage-dependent manner. However, despite a partial block by magnesium, Müller cells remained responsive to NMDA at the resting membrane potential. Under assay conditions not blocking K+ currents, exposure of Müller cells to NMDA was associated with an MK-801 sensitive inhibition of the inward-rectifying K+ current (IK(IR)), the largest current of these glia. This inhibitory effect of NMDA appears to be mediated by an influx of calcium since the inhibition of IK(IR) was significantly reduced when calcium was removed from the bathing solution or when the Müller cells contained the calcium chelator, BAPTA. Inhibition of the Müller cell KIR channels by the neurotransmitter glutamate is likely to have significant functional consequences for the retina since these ion channels are involved in K+ homeostasis, which in turn influences neuronal excitability.

26405298|t|Cystathionine β-synthase regulates endothelial function via protein S-sulfhydration.
26405298|a|Deficiencies of the human cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) enzyme are characterized by a plethora of vascular disorders and hyperhomocysteinemia. However, several clinical trials demonstrated that despite reduction in homocysteine levels, disease outcome remained unaffected, thus the mechanism of endothelial dysfunction is poorly defined. Here, we show that the loss of CBS function in endothelial cells (ECs) leads to a significant down-regulation of cellular hydrogen sulfide (H2S) by 50% and of glutathione (GSH) by 40%. Silencing CBS in ECs compromised phenotypic and signaling responses to the VEGF that were potentiated by decreased transcription of VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2 and neuropilin (NRP)-1, the primary receptors regulating endothelial function. Transcriptional down-regulation of VEGFR-2 and NRP-1 was mediated by a lack in stability of the transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1), which is a sulfhydration target of H2S at residues Cys68 and Cys755. Reinstating H2S but not GSH in CBS-silenced ECs restored Sp1 levels and its binding to the VEGFR-2 promoter and VEGFR-2, NRP-1 expression, VEGF-dependent proliferation, and migration phenotypes. Thus, our study emphasizes the importance of CBS-mediated protein S-sulfhydration in maintaining vascular health and function.-Saha, S., Chakraborty, P. K., Xiong, X., Dwivedi, S. K. D., Mustafi, S.

27551496|t|Imeglimin prevents human endothelial cell death by inhibiting mitochondrial permeability transition without inhibiting mitochondrial respiration.
27551496|a|Imeglimin is the first in a new class of oral glucose-lowering agents, having recently completed its phase 2b trial. As Imeglimin did show a full prevention of β-cell apoptosis, and since angiopathy represents a major complication of diabetes, we studied Imeglimin protective effects on hyperglycemia-induced death of human endothelial cells (HMEC-1). These cells were incubated in several oxidative stress environments (exposure to high glucose and oxidizing agent tert-butylhydroperoxide) which led to mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) opening, cytochrome c release and cell death. These events were fully prevented by Imeglimin treatment. This protective effect on cell death occurred without any effect on oxygen consumption rate, on lactate production and on cytosolic redox or phosphate potentials. Imeglimin also dramatically decreased reactive oxygen species production, inhibiting specifically reverse electron transfer through complex I. We conclude that Imeglimin prevents hyperglycemia-induced cell death in HMEC-1 through inhibition of PTP opening without inhibiting mitochondrial respiration nor affecting cellular energy status. Considering the high prevalence of macrovascular and microvascular complications in type 2 diabetic subjects, these results together suggest a potential benefit of Imeglimin in diabetic angiopathy.

17386822|t|Electrochemical oxidation of ochratoxin A at a glassy carbon electrode and in situ evaluation of the interaction with deoxyribonucleic acid using an electrochemical deoxyribonucleic acid-biosensor.
17386822|a|Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a fungal metabolite that occurs in foods, beverages, animal tissues, human blood and presents carcinogenic, teratogenic and nephrotoxic properties. This study concerns the redox properties of OTA using electrochemical techniques which have the potential for providing insights into the biological redox reactions of this molecule. The in situ evaluation of the OTA interaction with DNA using a DNA-electrochemical biosensor is also reported. The oxidation of OTA is an irreversible process proceeds with the transfer of one electron and one proton in a diffusion-controlled mechanism. The diffusion coefficient of OTA was calculated in pH 7 phosphate buffer to be D(O) = 3.65x10(-6) cm2 s(-1). The oxidation of OTA is also pH dependent for electrolytes with pH<7 and involves the formation of a main oxidation product which adsorbs strongly at the GCE surface undergoing reversible oxidation. In alkaline electrolytes OTA undergoes chemical deprotonation, the oxidation involving only the transfer of one electron. The electrochemical dsDNA-biosensor was also used to evaluate the possible interaction between OTA and DNA. The experiments have clearly proven that OTA interacts and binds to dsDNA strands immobilized onto a GCE surface, but no evidence of DNA-damage caused by OTA was obtained.

2832316|t|Tumour necrosis factor beta (lymphotoxin) inhibits locomotion and stimulates the respiratory burst and degranulation of neutrophils.
2832316|a|The data presented here demonstrate that recombinant human tumour necrosis factor beta (rHuTNF beta; lymphotoxin) is a neutrophil modulator. The lymphokine inhibited the locomotion of neutrophils and augmented the neutrophil oxygen-dependent respiratory burst in response to N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (FMLP) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), as measured by their capacity to produce chemiluminescence, H2O2 and superoxide. The effects on the respiratory burst occurred at a tenth of the concentration of TNF beta required to inhibit locomotion. After incubation with TNF beta, the neutrophils could be washed without any reduction in their capacity to show augmented responses. The TNF beta enhanced granule enzyme (lysozyme and beta-glucuronidase) release of neutrophils stimulated with cytochalasin B-FMLP.

26151031|t|Free radical scavenging ability of Aspalathus linearis in two in vitro models of diabetes and cancer.
26151031|a|The free radical scavenging activity of Aspalathus linearis (Rooibos tea) and its effect on reactive oxygen species (ROS), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were investigated in two in vitro disease models of cancer and diabetes. Although the antioxidant activity of this tea has been reported in several studies, its effects in disease models of ROS-induced oxidative stress have not been systematically evaluated to date. The oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay was used in this study to quantify the antioxidant capacity of the extract, whereas the ROS scavenging ability in hyperglycemia-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and HeLa cells were investigated. The CAT and SOD assays were also carried out in the two disease models in order to evaluate the effect of the extract in the stimulation of these two enzyme activities. The extract was observed to have reduced ROS in a dose-dependent manner in both HUVECs and HeLa cells. The stimulation of the CAT and SOD enzyme activities were observed to be dose-dependent as well. The high ORAC value of the extract indicated the presence of antioxidant compounds which could directly quench ROS, whereby this mechanism of action could be hypothesized to have been further complemented through the stimulation of CAT and SOD. Overall, the Aspalathus linearis extract was observed to have increased the CAT and SOD activities in two in vitro disease models of cancer and hyperglycemia. Given the correlation between the ORAC values, the increases in CAT and SOD activities and the reduction in ROS in a dose-dependent manner, it could be hypothesized that the extract had a significant therapeutic potential for either the prevention of the onset of the two diseases or their progression because ROS has been identified as their root causes.

2092413|t|Effects of passive limb movement on pulmonary ventilation.
2092413|a|This study was undertaken to determine if the observed increase in ventilation during passive limb movement was a reflex hyperventilation or a response to an increased metabolic need for oxygen. Experiments on human volunteers were designed to test the hypothesis that the rapid increase of ventilation at the onset of exercise was due to stimulation of the joints. Results of these studies showed significant increases in ventilation, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, ventilation/oxygen consumption ratio, and heart rate compared to rest and recovery values. The data lead to the conclusion that the rapid increase of ventilation at the onset of exercise is a true hyperventilation and that stimulation of the joints can be a significant contributor to increased pulmonary ventilation.

20958096|t|Nitrate and nitrite content of human, formula, bovine, and soy milks: implications for dietary nitrite and nitrate recommendations.
20958096|a|BACKGROUND: Estimation of nitrate and nitrite concentrations of milk sources may provide insight into potential health risks and benefits of these food sources for infants, children, and adults. The World Health Organization and American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive consumption of human milk for the first 6 months of life. Human milk is known to confer significant nutritional and immunological benefits for the infant. Consumption of formula, cow's, and soy milk may be used as alternatives to human milk for infants. METHODS: We sought to estimate potential exposure to nitrate and nitrite in human, formula, bovine, and soy milk to inform total dietary exposure estimates and recommendations. Using sensitive quantitative methodologies, nitrite and nitrate were analyzed in different samples of milk. RESULTS: Human milk concentrations of colostrum (expressed days 1-3 postpartum; n=12), transition milk (expressed days 3-7 postpartum; n=17), and mature milk (expressed >7 days postpartum; n=50) were 0.08 mg/100 mL nitrite and 0.19 mg/100 mL nitrate, 0.001 mg/100 mL nitrite and 0.52 mg/100 mL nitrate, and 0.001 mg/100 mL nitrite and 0.3 mg/100 mL nitrate, respectively, revealing that the absolute amounts of these anions change as the composition of milk changes. When expressed as a percentage of the World Health Organization's Acceptable Daily Intake limits, Silk® Soy Vanilla (WhiteWave Foods, Broomfield, CO) intake could result in high nitrate intakes (104% of this standard), while intake of Bright Beginnings Soy Pediatric® formula (PBM Nutritionals, Georgia, VT) could result in the highest nitrite intakes (383% of this standard). CONCLUSIONS: The temporal relationship between the provision of nitrite in human milk and the development of commensal microbiota capable of reducing dietary nitrate to nitrite supports a hypothesis that humans are adapted to provide nitrite to the gastrointestinal tract from birth. These data support the hypothesis that the high concentrations of breastmilk nitrite and nitrate are evidence for a physiologic requirement to support gastrointestinal and immune homeostasis in the neonate.

18558727|t|2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin modulates the induction of DNA strand breaks and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 activation by 17beta-estradiol in human breast carcinoma cells through alteration of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 expression.
18558727|a|The primary purpose of this research is to investigate the effects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo- p-dioxin (TCDD) pretreatment and estrogen receptors-alpha (ER alpha) status on the induction of DNA damage by 17beta-estradiol (E 2) in human ER alpha(+)/MCF-7 and ER alpha(-)/MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Results indicated that E 2 (0.1-100 nM) alone induced significant increases in cytotoxic response, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and glutathione depletion in MDA-MB-231 cells but not in MCF-7 cells. At noncytotoxic concentrations, E 2 induced dose-related reduction in intracellular NAD(P)H in MDA-MB-231 cells through decreases in intracellular NAD (+) mediated by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) activation as determined by detection of the presence of polymers of ADP-ribose-modified PARP-1 using Western blotting. Further investigation using the single-cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assay confirmed that the PARP-1 activation induced by estrogen in MDA-MB-231 was due to increases in the number of DNA strand breaks. This evidence indicates that E 2 induces decreases in intracellular NAD(P)H and NAD (+) in MDA-MB-231 cells through PARP-1 activation mediated by the formation of DNA strand breaks. Further investigation indicated that the cytotoxic and DNA-damaging effects induced by E 2 in MDA-MB-231 cells were completely blocked by pretreatment of TCDD (10 nM for 72 h). In contrast, with TCDD pretreatment, significant increases in cytotoxic response, ROS generation, glutathione (GSH) depletion, DNA strand breaks, and PARP-1 activation were detected in MCF-7 cells exposed to E 2. We demonstrated that TCDD modulated the differential induction of DNA damage by estrogen in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells primarily through the inducibility of cytochrome P450 1A1 and 1B1 expression. Overall, this evidence suggests that TCDD is capable of inducing imbalances in the expression of enzymes responsible for the bioactivation of estrogen leading to the subsequent accumulation of DNA damage and initiation of DNA repair in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, we confirmed that ER alpha plays a protective role in modulating the induction of DNA damage by E 2 in human breast cancer cells.

7634752|t|Comparative effects of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I and insulin on whole-body and forearm palmitate metabolism in man.
7634752|a|1. The effects of intravenous infusions of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I and insulin on palmitate kinetics, lipolysis and on serum triacylglycerol were compared. Overnight-fasted normal subjects received high doses of insulin-like growth factor I (30 micrograms h-1 kg-1) and insulin (0.23 nmol h-1 kg-1; group 1), low doses of insulin-like growth factor I (5 micrograms h-1 kg-1) and insulin (0.04 nmol h-1 kg-1; group 2) or saline (control group). The doses of insulin-like growth factor I and insulin were equipotent with regard to increases in glucose uptake during 8 h euglycaemic clamping. 2. Whole-body palmitate flux (measured by continuous infusions of [2,2-D2]palmitate) was lowered dose-dependently by 68% +/- 6% during insulin-like growth factor I and by 82% +/- 2% during insulin after 8 h of infusions of high doses (insulin-like growth factor I versus insulin; not significant). Plasma palmitate, glycerol and triacylglycerol concentrations had decreased to a similar extent at the end of the infusions of both peptides at either dose. 3. The present results demonstrate that insulin-like growth factor I and insulin infused at doses which result in identical increases in glucose uptake during euglycaemic clamping are equipotent inhibitors of lipolysis.

25307793|t|Hexokinase--A limiting factor in lipid production from fructose in Yarrowia lipolytica.
25307793|a|Microbial biolipid production has become an important part of making biofuel production economically feasible. Genetic engineering has been used to improve the ability of Yarrowia lipolytica, an oleaginous yeast, to produce lipids using glucose-based media. However, few studies have examined lipid accumulation by Y. lipolytica's ability to utilize other hexose sugars, and as of yet, the rate-limiting steps in this process are unidentified. In this study, we investigated the de novo accumulation of lipids by Y. lipolytica when grown in glucose, fructose, and sucrose. Three Y. lipolytica wild-type (WT) strains of varied origin differed significantly in their lipid production, growth, and fructose utilization. Hexokinase (ylHXK1p) activity partially explained these differences. Overexpression of the ylHXK1 gene led to increased hexokinase activity (6.5-12 times higher) in the mutants versus the WT strains; a pronounced reduction in cell filamentation in mutants grown in fructose-based media; and improved biomass production, particularly in the mutant whose parent had shown the lowest growth capacity in fructose (French strain W29). All mutants showed improved lipid yield and production when grown on fructose, although the effect was strain dependent (23-55% improvement). Finally, we overexpressed ylHXK1 in a highly modified strain of Y. lipolytica W29 engineered to optimize oil production. This modification was combined with Saccharomyces cerevisiae invertase gene expression to evaluate the resulting mutant's ability to produce lipids using cheap industrial substrates, namely sucrose (a major component of molasses). Sucrose turned out to be a better substrate than either of its building blocks, glucose or fructose. Over its 96 h of growth in the bioreactors, this highly modified strain produced 9.15 g L(-1) of lipids, yielding 0.262 g g(-1) of biomass.

10889449|t|Oxygen free radicals mediate the induction of manganese superoxide dismutase gene expression by TNF-alpha.
10889449|a|In this study, the hypothesis that oxygen free radicals act as intracellular messengers is examined. Treatment of human oral carcinoma SCC-25 cells with 200 ng/ml human TNF-alpha for 6 h greatly increased manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) gene expression as detected by western blotting, RT-PCR, and nuclear run-on experiments. In the presence of the oxygen free radical spin trapping reagent, 5,5-dimethyl pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO), the induction of MnSOD gene expression by TNF-alpha was significantly reduced. Electron paramagnetic resonance experiments showed that the production of oxygen free radicals was enhanced in TNF-alpha treated cells. Taken together, these observations suggest that the induction of MnSOD expression by TNF-alpha is at least partially mediated by intracellular formation of oxygen free radicals, and that superoxide is most likely the initiating species involved in the mediation of MnSOD gene expression by TNF-alpha.

12163660|t|In vitro fermentation properties of selected fructooligosaccharide-containing vegetables and in vivo colonic microbial populations are affected by the diets of healthy human infants.
12163660|a|Salsify (Tragopogon porrifolius) and gobo (Arctium lappa) are root vegetables that contain high concentrations of naturally occurring fructooligosaccharides (FOS), nondigestible oligosaccharides that have prebiotic effects on the intestinal microflora. The objective of this study was to compare colonic microbial populations and the fermentation characteristics of gobo and salsify in breast-fed vs. formula-fed infants. Fecal inoculum from breast-fed and formula-fed infants consuming either no solid foods, cereal, or fruit and vegetable purees were fermented in vitro with sweet potato puree plus gobo, salsify puree or a control vegetable, carrot. Breast-fed and formula-fed infants had similar fecal bacteria concentrations, with the exception of Clostridium perfringens (P < 0.10). Introduction of solid foods into the diet of infants was associated with increased fecal concentrations of bifidobacteria (P < 0.10) and decreased concentrations of total aerobes (P < 0.01), C. perfringens (P < 0.001) and Escherichia coli (P < 0.10). Inoculum from feces of breast-fed infants resulted in greater acetate production, whereas inoculum from feces of formula-fed infants resulted in greater propionate and butyrate production (P < 0.05). Fermentation of FOS-containing vegetables by infant fecal inoculum did not differ significantly from fermentation of carrots as assessed by total short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. The addition of solids to the diet of infants was associated with increased production of acetate and total SCFA (P < 0.05). It appears that both the composition and fermentative activity of the colonic microflora of human infants is affected by breast-feeding and solid food consumption, but not by short-term exposure to low concentrations of FOS-containing substrates.

28410194|t|Chicoric acid is a potent anti-atherosclerotic ingredient by anti-oxidant action and anti-inflammation capacity.
28410194|a|Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is linked to both oxidative stress and endothelial cell dysfunction. Chicoric acid has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In the present investigation, we demonstrated that chicoric acid inhibits oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-facilitated dysfunction in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Oxidative injuries were tested by investigating the formation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and by examining the activity of antioxidant enzymes and the function of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). We also confirmed that chicoric acid mitigates apoptotic features caused by oxLDL, such as the subsequent break down of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and the activation of Bax, which promote DNA strand breaks and activate caspase-3. Moreover, our data revealed that chicoric acid attenuated the oxLDL activation of NF-κB, the attachment of THP-1 cells and the overexpression of adhesion molecules in human endothelial cells. The results of this study suggest a potential molecular mechanism through which chicoric acid inhibits oxLDL-induced human endothelial dysfunction.

7812580|t|Determination of gas exchange threshold by nonparametric regression.
7812580|a|The gas exchange threshold (GET) has been used an an index of anaerobic threshold because it can be measured noninvasively. GET is estimated from a breakpoint in breath by breath values of carbon dioxide uptake (Vco2) and oxygen uptake (Vo2) obtained during a progressive exercise test. Three methods of estimating GET were evaluated: (1) the original V slope method (OVS) using two adjoining standard linear regressions, (2) the modified V slope method (MVS) where the breakpoint is detected by visual inspection, and (3) a new method that we developed with nonparametric regression (NPM) using cubic splines. Simulated data were used because the existence of a breakpoint is known with certainty. Detection accuracy for OVS and MVS never exceeded 63% because of a low specificity. The detection accuracy of NPM ranged between 50 and 89% depending on the amount of noise and abruptness of the threshold, and exceeded that of OVS and MVS at low levels of noise. NPM was significantly more accurate (p < 0.05) than OVS and MVS for detecting GET except with high levels of noise. Both NPM and OVS have similar degrees of numerical accuracy and are superior to the currently used MVS method in this respect. All three methods gave similar results on 20 exercise tests. We conclude from the simulated data that NPM is more accurate than OVS and MVS at detecting GET. NPM can be applied to human data and it provides results that are consistent with OVS and MVS.

16978689|t|Immunoglobulin G depletion from human serum with metal-chelated beads under magnetic field.
16978689|a|Magnetic poly(ethylene glycol dimethacrylate-N-methacryloyl-(L)-histidine methyl ester) [mag-poly(EGDMA-MAH) beads, 50-100 microm in diameter, were produced by suspension polymerization for affinity depletion of immunoglobulin G (IgG) from human serum. Cu2+ ions were complexed directly via MAH groups (Cu2+ loading: 4.1 micromol/g). IgG depletion studies were performed by magnetically stabilized fluidized bed column. Acetate, Tris-HCl, MES and phosphate buffers all allow adsorption of similar quantities of IgG (27.3-45.6 mg/g). MOPS and HEPES allow higher adsorption quantities (79.6 mg/g and 74.1mg/g, respectively). Maximum adsorption capacities in MOPS buffer were 46.8 mg/g for mag-poly(EGDMA-MAH) and 102.1mg/g for Cu2+ chelated mag-poly(EGDMA-MAH) beads. The adsorption capacity decreased drastically from 102.1mg/g to 30.7 mg/g with the increase of the flow rate from 0.2 ml/min to 3.5 ml/min. The elution studies were performed by 1.0M NaCl. The elution results demonstrated that the adsorption of IgG to the adsorbent was reversible. To test the efficiency of IgG depletion from human serum, proteins in the serum and eluted portion were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The depletion efficiency for IgG was above 99.4%. Eluted proteins include mainly IgG, and a small number of non-albumin proteins such as apo-lipoprotein A1, sero-transferrin, haptoglobulin and alpha1-antitrypsin. When anti-HSA-sepharose adsorbent is used together with our metal-chelated mag-beads, IgG and HSA can be depleted in a single step.

12782002|t|Testosterone, but not nonaromatizable dihydrotestosterone, improves working memory and alters nerve growth factor levels in aged male rats.
12782002|a|Recent studies have suggested that testosterone levels are lower in men with Alzheimer's disease and that testosterone treatment improves cognition in older men. Since testosterone can be aromatized to estrogen, testosterone's effects could be due to conversion into estrogen. We treated aged male rats with either testosterone or dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the latter of which is not aromatized to estrogen, in order to determine whether these treatments improve spatial working and reference memory as assessed in the water radial arm maze. We also tested whether such effects are related to beta-amyloid levels in the hippocampus or neurotrophin levels in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, frontal cortex, or striatum. Aged rats made more errors than young rats on all memory measures. Testosterone, but not DHT, improved working memory and decreased hippocampal NGF protein in aged rats, while having no effect on beta-amyloid. However, higher beta-amyloid levels were correlated with poorer working memory performance in young rats. Neurotrophin levels in entorhinal cortex were positively correlated with errors for all memory measures in androgen-treated rats. Similar to findings in human studies, in our study androgen treatment lowered circulating estradiol levels in aged rats, suggesting that androgen treatment exerts feedback to the hypothalamic pituitary axis and that conversion to estrogen may not be the underlying biological mechanism of testosterone's effects on memory and growth factor levels. The ratio of estradiol to testosterone, or the actions of the aromatase enzyme itself, may be responsible for the observed effects. These data support the hypothesis that testosterone therapy in aging men may provide positive effects on cognition and that neural regions that are linked to cognition, such as the hippocampus and/or entorhinal cortex, may be involved in such effects.

7315094|t|Membrane phosphorylation in intact human erythrocytes.
7315094|a|The time course of 32P incorporation into ATP and monoesterified membrane phosphatases was studied within 1 h of incubation of intact human erythrocytes. Analysis of membrane proteins and phospholipids showed dynamically exchanged phosphates mainly in the phospholipid fraction. The extent of ATP turnover by spectrin band 2 polypeptide phosphorylation was very small. The 32P-ATP and the membrane 32P-phosphate label could be chased via the metabolism by the addition of extracellular Pi. From the relative changes in the specific radioactivity of ATP and of the membrane phosphate in intact erythrocytes we assume that about 60% of the erythrocyte ATP production are linked to the ATP consumption by the rapid polyphosphoinositide turnover. It is conceivable that there is a connection between the protein factors modifying the affinity of (Ca2+, Mg2+)-ATPase and the metabolism of the polyphosphoinositides in the erythrocyte membrane.

14613329|t|Synthesis of second-generation transition state analogues of human purine nucleoside phosphorylase.
14613329|a|Purine nucleoside phosphorylases (PNPs) catalyze nucleophilic displacement reactions by migration of the cationic ribooxacarbenium carbon between the fixed purine and phosphate nucleophiles. As the phosphorolysis reaction progresses along the reaction coordinate, the distance between the purine and carbocation increases and the distance between carbocation and phosphate anion decreases. Immucillin-H and Immucillin-G have been shown previously to be potent inhibitors of PNP. We now report the synthesis of a second generation of stable transition state analogues, DADMe-Immucillins 2, 3, and 4, with increased distance between ribooxacarbenium and purine mimics by incorporation of a methylene bridge between these groups. These compounds are potent inhibitors with equilibrium dissociation constants as low as 7 pM against human PNP. Stable chemical analogues of enzymatic transition states are necessarily imperfect since they lack the partial bond character of the transition state. The immucillins and DADMe-Immucillins represent approaches from the product and reaction side of the transition state.

8290656|t|Dominance of the mutant ALDH2(2) allele in the expression of human stomach aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 activity.
8290656|a|About half of Chinese individuals lack mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2) activity, which is responsible for the oxidation of acetaldehyde produced during ethanol metabolism. The ALDH2 deficiency in Chinese has been implicated in alcohol flush reaction and reported to be a negative risk factor for development of alcohol dependence. To assess the effects of inactive ALDH2 subunits, encoded by the mutant ALDH2(2) allele, on the catalytic activity of tetrameric enzyme molecules, we have phenotyped ALDH2 from 30 gastroendoscopic biopsies by using agarose isoelectric focusing and determined the genotypes from leukocytes of the same individuals by using polymerase-chain-reaction amplification and hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes. Sixteen subjects were homozygous for the ALDH2(1) allele, one was homozygous for ALDH2(2), and thirteen were the heterozygous genotype. None of the subjects with the mutant homozygotic and the heterozygotic genotypes exhibited the ALDH2 activity band or intermediate bands between ALDH2 and ALDH1 on isoelectric focusing gels. Our results support the notion that the mutant allele is dominant and that the heterotetrameric ALDH2 molecules containing the mutant subunits are enzymatically inactive or far less active.

1970745|t|A human breathing simulator designed to test the life support system of a hyperbaric tent.
1970745|a|A self contained life support system which can maintain a breathable atmosphere for up to eight hours was recently developed for use with a portable hyperbaric tent. To facilitate further life support system studies, the practicality of a human breathing simulator (HBS), which would remove oxygen and release carbon dioxide at the same rate as a human, was tested. The HBS consists of a cylinder of carbon dioxide bled into the chamber via a flow regulator and a Vanadous bubbler to chemically remove oxygen from the chamber. First experiments show that the HBS works, but that a larger chemical system is needed to remove oxygen at the desired rate. Scale up calculations have been completed.

2175282|t|Inhibition of neutrophil superoxide secretion by the preservative, methylhydroxybenzoate: effects mediated by perturbation of intracellular Ca2+?
2175282|a|The preservative, methylhydroxybenzoate inhibited O2- secretion from human neutrophils activated by both the chemotactic peptide fMet-Leu-Phe and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA): the low level of oxidant secretion activated by the ionophore A23187 was similarly reduced in preservative-treated suspensions. Oxidant secretion was similarly reduced in fMet-Leu-Phe and A23187 treated suspensions in which intracellular Ca2+ was buffered by loading with Quin-2, indicating that methylhydroxybenzoate may exert its effects by perturbation of intracellular Ca2(+)-dependent processes. Methylhydroxybenzoate could mimic EGTA in preventing the Ca2+ dependent enhancement of trypsin activity and could also bind this cation in experiments using a Ca2+ electrode, although the preservative bound Ca2+ more slowly and had a lower affinity than EGTA. These data indicate that methylhydroxybenzoate may exert its effects on neutrophils by perturbation of Ca2(+)-dependent activation pathways and this phenomenon may also explain its other known pharmacological effects. Furthermore, these observations provide an insight into the mechanisms by which intracellular Ca2+ may regulate oxidant secretion.

14657615|t|Interleukin-1 and nitric oxide increase NADPH oxidase activity in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells.
14657615|a|OBJECTIVE: Cytokines, nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are well known for their pathogenic effects in development of cardiovascular diseases. Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) is known to induce NO generation, however it is not well established if IL-1beta or NO regulate production of ROS, such as superoxide anion. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of IL-1beta or NO on enzyme activity of NADPH oxidase (NOX), a superoxide-generating system recently documented to participate in a variety of vascular functions. METHODS: Human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (SMC) obtained from Clonetics were treated with IL-1beta and NO donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), in culture. Nitrites accumulated in supernatants of SMC cultures were measured as an index of NO released following treatment with IL-1beta. NOX enzyme activity was assayed using cytochrome c as the electron acceptor. RESULTS: Treatment with IL-1beta resulted in a 3-fold increase in the production of NO by SMC. Both IL-1beta and SNP enhanced NOX activity, by 67 and 45%, respectively, following 24 h of treatment. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that NO or NO- generating cytokines might regulate the production of ROS in the cardiovascular system through modulation of superoxide-generating systems such as NOX.

8897819|t|Inadequacy of high K+/nigericin for calibrating BCECF. I. Estimating steady-state intracellular pH.
8897819|a|Intracellular pH (pHi) was measured in single vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells, cultured from rabbit abdominal aorta, using 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) on a microscope-based fluorescence system. Three lines of evidence are presented that using nigericin along with high external K+ to calibrate intracellular BCECF produces systematic errors in pHi. 1) The intrinsic buffering power (beta int), measured using weak bases (e.g., ammonium), was 2.5 times smaller than that measured using weak acids (e.g., propionic acid). This discrepancy became small if pHi had really been approximately 0.2 lower than what was estimated using nigericin-calibrated pHi values. 2) Total cellular buffering power (beta tot) in the presence of CO2/HCO-3 was measured and found to be much smaller than could account for the beta int, together with the contribution of CO2/HCO3 (beta CO2: assumed to be an open system buffer). If the true pHi values were approximately 0.2-0.4 lower than our nigericin-calibrated values, then the sum of beta int and beta CO2 equals beta tot. 3) A null technique was utilized for bracketing steady-state pHi; estimates of steady-state pHi using this null technique were approximately 0.2 lower than the high K+/nigericin-calibrated estimates. Four other cell types were examined: rat hepatocytes, rat corticotrophs, human keratinocytes, and rabbit fibroblasts. These other cells also displayed discrepancies between null and nigericin estimates of steady-state pHi, as well as differences between buffering power assessed using weak bases and acids. Finally, one potential source for these discrepancies is described: selecting an inappropriate external K+ to use with nigericin can produce systematic errors in pHi of approximately 0.1.

23970211|t|Human milk and the premature infant.
23970211|a|Human milk is the preferred feeding for both term and preterm infants. While being considered optimal for term infants, human milk, even from mothers delivering preterm infants, is lacking in protein, energy, sodium, calcium, and phosphorus, resulting in poorer growth and nutrient deficiencies when compared to formulas designed for these high-risk infants. Further, the lack of growth is associated with long-term adverse consequences. Since human milk has unique properties in promoting gastrointestinal maturation and immunological benefits, it is prudent to implement strategies to fortify it appropriately to realize its benefits which include reduced rates of necrotizing enterocolitis, fewer episodes of sepsis and urinary tract infections, and improved visual and neurocognitive development. Donor human milk is being widely used when mothers' own milk is not available or is in short supply. While it retains some of the biological properties and clinical benefits of mothers' own milk, it requires additional care in fortification, especially if the donor milk is from a pool of term human milk. As nutritional strategies improve, the ultimate goal is to minimize extrauterine growth restriction and promote appropriate growth after regaining birth weight.

9235906|t|Isolation and characterization of a thiamin transport gene, THI10, from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
9235906|a|We isolated a thiamin transporter gene, THI10, from a genomic library of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by the complementation of a yeast mutant defective in thiamin transport activity. The THI10 gene contained an open reading frame of 1,794 base pairs encoding a 598-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular weight of 66, 903. The nucleotide sequence of THI10 is completely identical to that of an anonymous DNA (open reading frame L8083.2) mapped to chromosome XII; two other genes (open reading frames YOR071c and YOR192c) in chromosome XV are extremely similar to THI10. Moreover, the THI10 gene product showed significant sequence homology with yeast allantoin and uracil transporters. Hydropathy profile suggested that THI10 product is highly hydrophobic and contains many transmembrane regions. Gene disruption of the THI10 locus completely abolished the thiamin transport activity and thiamin binding activity in yeast plasma membrane fraction. Both the transport and thiamin binding activities were restored in the disrupted cells when the THI10 open reading frame was expressed by yeast GAL1 promoter, suggesting that the THI10 gene encodes for the thiamin transport carrier protein. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that THI10 gene expression is regulated at the mRNA level by intracellular thiamin pyrophosphate and that it requires a positive regulatory factor encoded by THI3 gene.

18728046|t|Effects of inorganic arsenic on the rat and mouse urinary bladder.
18728046|a|Inorganic arsenic (arsenate and arsenite) is a known human carcinogen, inducing tumors of the skin, urinary bladder, and lung. Understanding the mechanism of inorganic arsenic carcinogenesis has been hampered by a lack of animal models. To define the urothelial effects of inorganic arsenic, we administered arsenate and arsenite in the diet or drinking water to rats and mice in several short-term experiments (2-10 weeks). Treatment with arsenate or arsenite in the drinking water or diet induced cytotoxicity and necrosis of the urothelial superficial layer and hyperplasia in rats and mice. Arsenate-induced changes occurred later in mice compared with arsenite-induced changes, but not in the rat. Hyperplasia in rats was evident by light microscopy at an earlier time point (2 weeks) than previously observed after treatment with dimethylarsinic acid (DMA(V)). The bromodeoxyuridine labeling index was increased in treated rats. We were unable to determine the bromodeoxyuridine labeling index in mice. The effects of inorganic arsenicals on the bladder were greater when administered in the drinking water than in the diet in rats and mice, but so was the overall toxicity to the animal. The female rat appeared more sensitive to the effects of inorganic arsenic than the male rat, but effects were similar in female and male mice. The mode of action of inorganic arsenic in rats and mice appears to involve urothelial cytotoxicity, increased cell proliferation and ultimately tumors. Cytotoxicity is likely due to the generation of reactive trivalent arsenicals excreted in the urine.

25099178|t|Anti-wrinkle effect of magnesium lithospermate B from Salvia miltiorrhiza BUNGE: inhibition of MMPs via NF-kB signaling.
25099178|a|Skin is in direct contact with the environment and therefore undergoes aging as a consequence of environmentally induce damage. Wrinkle formation is a striking feature of intrinsic and photo-induced skin aging, which are both associated with oxidative stress and inflammatory response. The present study was undertaken to identify the mechanisms responsible for the anti-wrinkle effects of MLB, and thus, we investigated whether magnesium lithospermate B (MLB) from Salvia miltiorrhiza BUNGE associated with wrinkle formation caused by intrinsic and extrinsic skin aging using Sprague-Dawley rats aged 5 and 20 months and ultraviolet B (UVB)-irradiated human skin fibroblasts cells, respectively. The results obtained showed that the oral administration of MLB significantly upregulated the level of type I procollagen and downregulated the activities and expressions of matrix-metalloproteinases (MMPs) in rat skin. In fibroblasts, MLB suppressed the transactivation of nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) and activator protein 1(AP-1), which are the two transcription factors responsible for MMP expression, by suppressing oxidative stress and the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Our results show that the antioxidant effect of MLB is due to the direct scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and its inhibitory effects on NF-kB-dependent inflammation genes, such as, cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase. MLB was found to reverse both age- and UVB-related reductions in skin procollagen levels by suppressing the expressions and activities of NF-kB and AP-1-dependent MMPs by modulating ROS generation and the MAPK signaling pathway. We suggest that MLB potentially has anti-wrinkle and anti-skin aging effects.

24141015|a|Transcripts of the UGT1A gene, encoding half of human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes, undergo alternative splicing, resulting in active enzymes named isoforms 1 (i1s) and novel truncated isoforms 2 (i2s). Here, we investigated the effects of depleting endogenous i2 on drug response and attempted to unveil any additional biologic role(s) for the truncated novel UGT proteins. We used an integrated systems biology approach that combines RNA interference with unbiased global genomic and proteomic screens, and used HT115 colorectal cancer cells as a model. Consistent with previous evidence suggesting that i2s negatively regulate i1s through protein-protein interactions, i2-depleted cells were less sensitive to drug-induced cell death (IC50 of 0.45 ± 0.05 µM versus 0.22 ± 0.03 µM; P = 0.006), demonstrating that modulation of i2 levels meaningfully impacts drug bioavailability and cellular response. We also observed reduced production of reactive oxygen species by 30% (P < 0.05), and an enhanced expression (>1.2-fold; P < 0.05) of several proteins, such as hemoglobin α genes and superoxide dismutase 1, that have network functions associated with antioxidant properties. Interaction proteomics analysis of endogenous proteins from the cellular model, mainly in human intestine but also in kidney tissues, further uncovered interactions between i2s (but not i1s) and the antioxidant enzymes catalase and peroxiredoxin 1, which may influence antioxidant potential through sequestration of these novel partners. Our findings demonstrate for the first time dual roles for i2s in the cellular defense system as endogenous regulators of drug response as well as in oxidative stress.

12176741|t|Oxidant and antioxidant modulation of chloride channels expressed in human retinal pigment epithelium.
12176741|a|Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) possesses regulated chloride channels that are crucial for transepithelial fluid and ion transport. At present, little is known about the molecular nature of chloride channels in human adult RPE (haRPE) or the effects of oxidative stress on membrane conductance properties. In the present study, we assessed ClC channel and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) expression and membrane chloride conductance properties in haRPE cells. ClC-5, ClC-3, ClC-2, and CFTR mRNA expression was confirmed with RT-PCR analysis, and protein expression was detected with Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy. Whole cell recordings of primary cultures of haRPE showed an outwardly rectifying chloride current that was inhibited by the oxidant H(2)O(2). The inhibitory effects of H(2)O(2) were reduced in cultured human RPE cells that were incubated with precursors of glutathione synthesis or that were stably transfected to overexpress glutathione S-transferase. These findings indicate a possible role for ClC channels in haRPE cells and suggest possible redox modulation of human RPE chloride conductances.

12732649|t|Yeast frataxin sequentially chaperones and stores iron by coupling protein assembly with iron oxidation.
12732649|a|We have investigated the mechanism of frataxin, a conserved mitochondrial protein involved in iron metabolism and neurodegenerative disease. Previous studies revealed that the yeast frataxin homologue (mYfh1p) is activated by Fe(II) in the presence of O2 and assembles stepwise into a 48-subunit multimer (alpha48) that sequesters >2000 atoms of iron in 2-4-nm cores structurally similar to ferritin iron cores. Here we show that mYfh1p assembly is driven by two sequential iron oxidation reactions: A ferroxidase reaction catalyzed by mYfh1p induces the first assembly step (alpha --> alpha3), followed by a slower autoxidation reaction that promotes the assembly of higher order oligomers yielding alpha48. Depending on the ionic environment, stepwise assembly is associated with accumulation of 50-75 Fe(II)/subunit. Initially, this Fe(II) is loosely bound to mYfh1p and can be readily mobilized by chelators or made available to the mitochondrial enzyme ferrochelatase to synthesize heme. Transfer of mYfh1p-bound Fe(II) to ferrochelatase occurs in the presence of citrate, a physiologic ferrous iron chelator, suggesting that the transfer involves an intermolecular interaction. If mYfh1p-bound Fe(II) is not transferred to a ligand, iron oxidation, and mineralization proceed to completion, Fe(III) becomes progressively less accessible, and a stable iron-protein complex is formed. Iron oxidation-driven stepwise assembly is a novel mechanism by which yeast frataxin can function as an iron chaperone or an iron store.

28449123|t|Capturing a mammalian DNA polymerase extending from an oxidized nucleotide.
28449123|a|The oxidized nucleotide, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2΄-deoxyguanosine (8-oxoG), is one of the most abundant DNA lesions. 8-oxoG plays a major role in tumorigenesis and human disease. Biological consequences of 8-oxoG are mediated in part by its insertion into the genome, making it essential to understand how DNA polymerases handle 8-oxoG. Insertion of 8-oxoG is mutagenic when opposite adenine but not when opposite cytosine. However, either result leads to DNA damage at the primer terminus (3΄-end) during the succeeding insertion event. Extension from DNA damage at primer termini remains poorly understood. Using kinetics and time-lapse crystallography, we evaluated how a model DNA polymerase, human polymerase β, accommodates 8-oxoG at the primer terminus opposite cytosine and adenine. Notably, extension from the mutagenic base pair is favored over the non-mutagenic base pair. When 8-oxoG is at the primer terminus opposite cytosine, DNA centric changes lead to a clash between O8 of 8-oxoG and the phosphate backbone. Changes in the extension reaction resulting from the altered active site provide evidence for a stabilizing interaction between Arg254 and Asp256 that serves an important role during DNA synthesis reactions. These results provide novel insights into the impact of damage at the primer terminus on genomic stability and DNA synthesis.

25754766|t|Role of aldehyde dehydrogenase in hypoxic vasodilator effects of nitrite in rats and humans.
25754766|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hypoxic conditions favour the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide (NO) to elicit vasodilatation, but the mechanism(s) responsible for bioconversion remains ill defined. In the present study, we assess the role of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) in nitrite bioactivation under normoxia and hypoxia in the rat and human vasculature. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The role of ALDH2 in vascular responses to nitrite was studied using rat thoracic aorta and gluteal subcutaneous fat resistance vessels from patients with heart failure (HF; 16 patients) in vitro and by measurement of changes in forearm blood flow (FBF) during intra-arterial nitrite infusion (21 patients) in vivo. Specifically, we investigated the effects of (i) ALDH2 inhibition by cyanamide or propionaldehyde and the (ii) tolerance-independent inactivation of ALDH2 by glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) on the vasodilator activity of nitrite. In each setting, nitrite effects were measured via evaluation of the concentration-response relationship under normoxic and hypoxic conditions in the absence or presence of ALDH2 inhibitors. KEY RESULTS: Both in rat aorta and human resistance vessels, dilatation to nitrite was diminished following ALDH2 inhibition, in particular under hypoxia. In humans there was a non-significant trend towards attenuation of nitrite-mediated increases in FBF. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: In human and rat vascular tissue in vitro, hypoxic nitrite-mediated vasodilatation involves ALDH2. In patients with HF in vivo, the role of this enzyme in nitrite bioactivation is at the most, modest, suggesting the involvement of other more important mechanisms.

25368550|t|Vasoinhibins regulate the inner and outer blood-retinal barrier and limit retinal oxidative stress.
25368550|a|Vasoinhibins are prolactin fragments present in the retina, where they have been shown to prevent the hypervasopermeability associated with diabetes. Enhanced bradykinin (BK) production contributes to the increased transport through the blood-retina barrier (BRB) in diabetes. Here, we studied if vasoinhibins regulate BRB permeability by targeting the vascular endothelium and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) components of this barrier. Intravitreal injection of BK in male rats increased BRB permeability. Vasoinhibins prevented this effect, as did the B2 receptor antagonist Hoe-140. BK induced a transient decrease in mouse retinal and brain capillary endothelial monolayer resistance that was blocked by vasoinhibins. Both vasoinhibins and the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor L-NAME, but not the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), blocked the transient decrease in bovine umbilical vein endothelial cell (BUVEC) monolayer resistance induced by BK; this block was reversed by the NO donor DETANONOate. Vasoinhibins also prevented the BK-induced actin cytoskeleton redistribution, as did L-NAME. BK transiently decreased human RPE (ARPE-19) cell monolayer resistance, and this effect was blocked by vasoinhibins, L-NAME, and NAC. DETANONOate reverted the blocking effect of vasoinhibins. Similar to BK, the radical initiator Luperox induced a reduction in ARPE-19 cell monolayer resistance, which was prevented by vasoinhibins. These effects on RPE resistance coincided with actin cytoskeleton redistribution. Intravitreal injection of vasoinhibins reduced the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in retinas of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, particularly in the RPE and capillary-containing layers. Thus, vasoinhibins reduce BRB permeability by targeting both its main inner and outer components through NO- and ROS-dependent pathways, offering potential treatment strategies against diabetic retinopathies.

8078393|t|Reduced ubiquinone plasma levels in patients with liver cirrhosis and in chronic alcoholics.
8078393|a|Ubiquinone (CoQ10 coenzyme) is part of the respiratory chain in mitochondria, and acts as a scavenger in oxidative stress in cell membranes. Ubiquinone is mainly synthesized in the liver and partly derived from the diet; its plasma levels significantly correlate with tissue levels in experimental animals and in pathological states in man. By means of an original high-performance liquid chromatography technique, we measured ubiquinone plasma levels in 10 healthy subjects, in 27 patients with cirrhosis and in 22 chronic alcoholics with normal liver function. Ubiquinone levels were markedly reduced in cirrhosis (0.25 [SD 0.21] microgram/ml vs. 0.92 [0.38] in controls; P < 0.001), without any difference between alcohol- and non-alcohol-related disease. Also, in chronic alcoholics ubiquinone levels were nearly halved (0.49 [0.24]). In cirrhosis, ubiquinone plasma levels significantly correlated with cholesterol (P < 0.05), and with total bilirubin levels (P < 0.01). Our study highlights a remarkable deficiency in ubiquinone levels in patients with cirrhosis and in chronic alcoholics, to which both reduced hepatic synthesis and nutritional defects may contribute.

25041106|t|Leukemia inhibitor factor promotes functional recovery and oligodendrocyte survival in rat models of focal ischemia.
25041106|a|Human umbilical cord blood (HUCB) cells have shown efficacy in rodent models of focal ischemia and in vitro systems that recapitulate stroke conditions. One potential mechanism of protection is through secretion of soluble factors that protect neurons and oligodendrocytes (OLs) from oxidative stress. To overcome practical issues with cellular therapies, identification of soluble factors released by HUCB and other stem cells may pave the way for treatment modalities that are safer for a larger percentage of stroke patients. Among these soluble factors is leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a cytokine that exerts pleiotropic effects on cell survival. Here, data show that LIF effectively reduced infarct volume, reduced white matter injury and improved functional outcomes when administered to rats following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion. To further explore downstream signaling, primary oligodendrocyte cultures were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation to mimic stroke conditions. LIF significantly reduced lactate dehydrogenase release from OLs, reduced superoxide dismutase activity and induced peroxiredoxin 4 (Prdx4) transcript. Additionally, the protective and antioxidant capacity of LIF was negated by both Akt inhibition and co-incubation with Prdx4-neutralising antibodies, establishing a role for the Akt signaling pathway and Prdx4-mediated antioxidation in LIF protection.

25873670|t|ICE1 of Poncirus trifoliata functions in cold tolerance by modulating polyamine levels through interacting with arginine decarboxylase.
25873670|a|ICE1 (Inducer of CBF Expression 1) encodes a MYC-like basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that acts as a central regulator of cold response. In this study, we elucidated the function and underlying mechanisms of PtrICE1 from trifoliate orange [Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf.]. PtrICE1 was upregulated by cold, dehydration, and salt, with the greatest induction under cold conditions. PtrICE1 was localized in the nucleus and could bind to a MYC-recognizing sequence. Ectopic expression of PtrICE1 in tobacco and lemon conferred enhanced tolerance to cold stresses at either chilling or freezing temperatures. Yeast two-hybrid screening revealed that 21 proteins belonged to the PtrICE1 interactome, in which PtADC (arginine decarboxylase) was confirmed as a bona fide protein interacting with PtrICE1. Transcript levels of ADC genes in the transgenic lines were slightly elevated under normal growth condition but substantially increased under cold conditions, consistent with changes in free polyamine levels. By contrast, accumulation of the reactive oxygen species, H2O2 and O2 (-), was appreciably alleviated in the transgenic lines under cold stress. Higher activities of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase and catalase, were detected in the transgenic lines under cold conditions. Taken together, these results demonstrated that PtrICE1 plays a positive role in cold tolerance, which may be due to modulation of polyamine levels through interacting with the ADC gene.

25275038|t|Impact of sodium butyrate on the network of adhesion/growth-regulatory galectins in human colon cancer in vitro.
25275038|a|BACKGROUND/AIM: The physiological compound sodium butyrate can induce differentiation in colon cancer cells in vitro. Due to the role of galectins in growth control we explored its effect on this network beyond galectins-1 and -3, with deliberate consideration of the status of microsatellite stability, for nine cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Microscopical monitoring and measurement of alkaline phosphatase activity ascertained butyrate's impact on cells. Monitoring by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting with galectin-type-specific probes characterized galectin expression. RESULTS: Controlled by expectable strong up-regulation of galectin-1 and comparatively small effects on galectin-3 regulation for galectins-4, -7, -8 and -9 were reported with no obvious association to microsatellite stability status. Neoexpression of the GAL-12 gene was observed in eight out of nine tested lines. CONCLUSION: Butyrate affects the galectin network beyond galectins-1 and -3, warranting further cell biological and histochemical studies.

1249474|t|Age as a determinant of renal sodium conservation in normal man.
1249474|a|Age modifies a number of factors which determine renal sodium handling including the rate of glomerular filtration, renal hemodynamics, and the responsiveness of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. This study was carried out, therefore, to examine the effects of age on the capacity of the normal human kidney to respond to restriction of sodium intake. Renal conservation of sodium and response to dietary sodium restriction was assessed in 89 healthy subjects who were free of cardiovascular, renal, or adrenal disease. The daily reduction in urine sodium which followed restriction of intake to 10 mEq. of sodium and 100 mEq. of potassium per day conformed well to an exponential function, defined by an unweighted least-squares fit. The half-time for the reduction in renal sodium excretion in subjects under 30 years was -17.6 +/- 0.7 hours, significantly faster than for subjects aged 30 to 59, who had a relatively constant half-time (23.4 +/- 1.1 hours). In subjects over 60 years of age the half-time was prolonged to 30.9 +/- 2.8 hours, significantly greater than that of the younger age group. These observations indicate that age significantly influences the kidney's capacity to conserve sodium. Age-related change must be considered in the assessment of this function in human disease.

18500965|t|The regulation and expression of the creatine transporter: a brief review of creatine supplementation in humans and animals.
18500965|a|Creatine monohydrate has become one of the most popular ergogenic sport supplements used today. It is a nonessential dietary compound that is both endogenously synthesized and naturally ingested through diet. Creatine ingested through supplementation has been observed to be absorbed into the muscle exclusively by means of a creatine transporter, CreaT1. The major rationale of creatine supplementation is to maximize the increase within the intracellular pool of total creatine (creatine + phosphocreatine). There is much evidence indicating that creatine supplementation can improve athletic performance and cellular bioenergetics, although variability does exist. It is hypothesized that this variability is due to the process that controls both the influx and efflux of creatine across the cell membrane, and is likely due to a decrease in activity of the creatine transporter from various compounding factors. Furthermore, additional data suggests that an individual's initial biological profile may partially determine the efficacy of a creatine supplementation protocol. This brief review will examine both animal and human research in relation to the regulation and expression of the creatine transporter (CreaT). The current literature is very preliminary in regards to examining how creatine supplementation affects CreaT expression while concomitantly following a resistance training regimen. In conclusion, it is prudent that future research begin to examine CreaT expression due to creatine supplementation in humans in much the same way as in animal models.

11411789|t|Ethanol inhibits L-arginine uptake and enhances NO formation in human placenta.
11411789|a|The acute effects of ethanol (20-60 mM) on L-arginine uptake and nitric oxide (NO) formation was investigated in human placental cotyledons perfused at constant flow. Ethanol (40 mM) decreased L-[3H]arginine uptake from 27.6 +/- 2.3 to 15.8 +/- 1.3 per cent (P < 0.05) of the injected dose and significantly enhanced NO levels in the perfusate from 0.88 +/- 0.11 to 2.80 +/- 0.39 microM. Ethanol also elicited the constriction of placental vessels. The effects of ethanol (20-60 mM) on L-arginine uptake and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activity were also investigated in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). After 60 min of ethanol (40 mM) exposure, basal L-[3H]arginine uptake (4.7 +/- 0.3 pmol/microg protein/min) was inhibited by 60 per cent (P < 0.05). Basal eNOS activity in HUVEC determined under "no flow" (static) conditions was significantly increased (approximately 1.8 fold) by 60 mM ethanol. These data are consistent with a stimulatory effect of ethanol on eNOS activity in both basal and flow-stimulated conditions, which may serve a protective role against its vasoconstrictive acute effect. While acute ethanol administration inhibits L-arginine uptake, the present results do not allow us to speculate on the effects of chronic ethanol exposure on NO formation in the fetoplacental unity.

18968042|t|Development of a fluoroimmunosensor for theophylline using immobilised antibody.
18968042|a|A flowthrough theophylline fluoroimmunosensor with an antibody covalently immobilised on a solid support has been developed. The immobilisation technique proposed in this paper used Protein-A on control pore glass (Protein A-CPG) in an immunoreactor and dimethylsuberimidate as a cross-linking agent. Several supports and cross-linking reagents were tested in order to obtain oriented immobilisation and thus efficiency of the immunological reaction and reusability of the immunosensor. The immunosensor performance characteristics were established. The precision expressed as RSD, was 1.6%; the detection limit was 3 mug l(-1); the immunoreactor lifetime was established in 80 assays and there were no interferences with structurally similar compounds such as aminophylline, dihydroxypropyltheophylline and caffeine in the determination of the analyte. This fluoroimmunosensor was applied to determine theophylline in human serum samples from patients of the Puerta de Hierro Hospital in Madrid. The results obtained show that there are no significant differences between the proposed immunosensor and the high-pressure liquid chromatographic method with UV detection used by the Hospital, thus demonstrating the validity of the method.

26731267|t|The Selective SGLT2 Inhibitor Ipragliflozin Has a Therapeutic Effect on Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis in Mice.
26731267|a|BACKGROUND & AIMS: In recent years, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has become a considerable healthcare burden worldwide. Pathogenesis of NASH is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and insulin resistance. However, a specific drug to treat NASH is lacking. We investigated the effect of the selective sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2I) ipragliflozin on NASH in mice. METHODS: We used the Amylin liver NASH model (AMLN), which is a diet-induced model of NASH that results in obesity and T2DM. AMLN mice were fed an AMLN diet for 20 weeks. SGLT2I mice were fed an AMLN diet for 12 weeks and an AMLN diet with 40 mg ipragliflozin/kg for 8 weeks. RESULTS: AMLN mice showed steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in the liver as well as obesity and insulin resistance, features that are recognized in human NASH. Ipragliflozin improved insulin resistance and liver injury. Ipragliflozin decreased serum levels of free fatty acids, hepatic lipid content, the number of apoptotic cells, and areas of fibrosis; it also increased lipid outflow from the liver. CONCLUSIONS: Ipragliflozin improved the pathogenesis of NASH by reducing insulin resistance and lipotoxicity in NASH-model mice. Our results suggest that ipragliflozin has a therapeutic effect on NASH with T2DM.

18675780|t|Effect of sphingomyelinase treatment on ligand binding activity of human serotonin1A receptors.
18675780|a|The serotonin1A receptor is an important member of the G-protein coupled receptor family, and is involved in the generation and modulation of a variety of cognitive, behavioral, and developmental functions. We have monitored the ligand binding of the human serotonin1A receptor stably expressed in CHO cells (termed CHO-5-HT1AR) following treatment with sphingomyelinase (SMase), an enzyme that specifically catalyzes the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin into ceramide and phosphorylcholine. Our results show, for the first time, that the specific ligand binding activity of the serotonin1A receptor in membranes isolated from CHO-5-HT1AR cells is increased upon sphingomyelinase treatment. Saturation binding analysis reveals increase in binding affinity of the receptor under these conditions. This is accompanied by a reduction in membrane order, as monitored by fluorescence anisotropy of the membrane probe 1-[4-(trimethylammonio)phenyl]-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (TMA-DPH) in intact cells. These results represent the first report on the effect of sphingomyelinase treatment on the ligand binding activity of this important neurotransmitter receptor.

11525437|t|Nitric oxide synthase activity in neutrophils from patients with localized aggressive periodontitis.
11525437|a|BACKGROUND: Localized aggressive periodontitis (LAgP) is associated with neutrophil dysfunction including defective chemotaxis and reduced calcium influx factor activity. Nitric oxide (NO) and its enzyme, nitric oxide synthase (NOS), have been suggested to be involved in chemotaxis. Some reports, however, were unable to detect either NO or NOS in human neutrophils. In this study, we focused on NOS activity in LAgP neutrophils and examined the involvement of NOS in chemotaxis of normal neutrophils and NOS activity in neutrophils from normal subjects and patients with LAgP. METHODS: Neutrophils from 10 normal subjects and 10 LAgP patients were isolated from peripheral venous blood. Membrane associated-NOS (MA-NOS) and soluble NOS (S-NOS) were extracted from cells with or without FMLP stimulation. NOS activity was measured using the radiolabeled L-arginine to L-citrulline conversion assay. RESULTS: N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an inhibitor of NOS, significantly inhibited FMLP-induced chemotaxis (P<0.01) and dibutyryl cGMP, an activator of cGMP-dependent protein kinase, significantly attenuated the inhibition by L-NAME (P<0.01). Unstimulated and FMLP-stimulated MA-NOS activity in LAgP neutrophils was statistically significantly higher than that in normal neutrophils (P<0.05). S-NOS activity in LAgP neutrophils was higher than that in normal neutrophils. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that NOS is present in human neutrophils and may be involved in FMLP-induced chemotaxis in normal neutrophils. NOS activity is increased in LAgP and is negatively correlated to chemotaxis response.

6607928|t|High alpha-amylase activity in the syncytiotrophoblastic cells of first-trimester human placentas.
6607928|a|The syncytiotrophoblastic brush border of the human placenta forms the maternal-fetal interface and is an important determinant of placental function. Electron micrographs of fresh brush border preparations isolated from first-trimester human placentas showed membrane vesicles, open-ended microvilli, and numerous glycogen particles. Analysis of the microvillar membranes for several plasma and intracellular membrane markers showed a high degree of purification, comparable to the results reported for the isolation of microvilli from full-term human placentas. The microvillar preparations from first-trimester placentas, however, also contained the enzymes necessary to synthesize and degrade glycogen. The degradation resulted in the accumulation of maltotriose and maltotetraose, apparently due to the action of a liver-type alpha-amylase. The occurrence of this enzyme and the enzymes for synthesizing glycogen in this brush border fraction is probably associated with the necessity for an extremely active glucose transport and liver-like storage system within the fetal tissue at this fetal-maternal membrane interface.

3875431|t|Mechanisms of cigarette smoke toxicity: the inactivation of human alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor by nitric oxide/isoprene mixtures in air.
3875431|a|A mixture of nitric oxide (NO) and isoprene in air has been studied as a model for gas-phase cigarette smoke. We have shown that this model system duplicates many of the properties of cigarette smoke including the inactivation of human alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor (a1PI). In this study, buffered solutions of a1PI were exposed to puffs of air containing 300 ppm NO and 400 ppm isoprene. Bubbling of the NO/air/isoprene gas stream directly through buffered protein solutions causes a1PI to undergo a fast loss of inhibitory capacity. This fast inactivation is not observed when a1PI is exposed to aqueous extracts of the NO/air/isoprene mixture. Both direct exposure and exposure to aqueous extracts, however, cause a1PI to undergo a slow loss of activity that continues for several days as the protein is incubated in the buffer solutions. Gas-phase cigarette smoke has already been shown to cause this same two-phase inactivation of a1PI. The inactivation of a1PI by the model system is dependent on the presence of oxygen in the gas stream, suggesting that the oxidation of nitric oxide to nitrogen dioxide in air is involved in the formation of the inactivating species. The nature of these species remains to be determined; however, small alkoxyl or peroxyl radicals (such as are spin-trappable from gas-phase smoke as well as from the NO/air/isoprene system) do not appear to inactivate a1PI. One possibility is that the inactivating species are metastable compounds formed by radical processes in the gas phase of both cigarette smoke and our model system. Our data suggest that one possible class of species is peroxynitrates.

3597362|t|Phosphorylation of caldesmon77 by protein kinase C in vitro and in intact human platelets.
3597362|a|Caldesmon is a widely distributed calmodulin- and actin-binding protein which occurs in different forms depending on the tissue or cell type under examination. On the basis of molecular weight, caldesmon species can be divided into two classes: caldesmon77 (Mr 70,000-80,000) and caldesmon150 (Mr 140,000-150,000). We have examined the phosphorylation of caldesmon77 by protein kinase C (the Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) in vitro and in intact platelets. Caldesmon77, purified from bovine liver, could be phosphorylated by purified rat brain protein kinase C to a level of approximately 1.0 mol of phosphate per mol of caldesmon77 monomer. Two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analysis reveals that caldesmon77 is phosphorylated at two major sites exclusively on serine residues. Following treatment of platelets with tumor-promoting phorbol ester, caldesmon77 phosphorylation was elevated 4-fold. Tryptic peptide mapping of phosphorylated platelet caldesmon77 demonstrates that phosphorylation is most significantly enhanced on two peptides which had migration patterns identical with those of the two major phosphopeptides of bovine liver caldesmon77 phosphorylated in vitro. The results of this study indicate that protein kinase C can phosphorylate caldesmon77 in vitro and in intact platelets, suggesting a role for protein kinase C in the regulation of caldesmon77 function or localization.

28475065|t|Catalytic Degradation of Dichlorvos Using Biosynthesized Zero Valent Iron Nanoparticles.
28475065|a|The removal of dichlorvos contamination from water is a challenging task because of the presence of direct carbon to phosphorous covalent bond, which makes them resistant to chemical and thermal degradation. Although there have been reports in the literature for degradation of dichlorvos using nanomaterials, those are based on photocatalysis. In this paper, we report a simple and rapid method for catalytic degradation of dichlorvos using protein-capped zero valent iron nanoparticles (FeNPs). We have developed an unprecedented reliable, clean, nontoxic, eco-friendly, and cost-effective biological method for the synthesis of uniformly distributed FeNPs. Yeast extract was used as reducing and capping agent in the synthesis of FeNPs, and synthesized particles were characterized by the UV-visible spectroscopy, X -ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM micrographs reveal that the nanoparticles size is distributed in the range of 2-10 nm. Selected area electron diffraction pattern shows the polycrystalline rings of FeNPs. The mean size was found to be 5.006 nm from ImageJ. FTIR spectra depicted the presence of biomolecules, which participated in the synthesis and stabilization of nanoparticles. As synthesized, FeNPs were used for the catalytic degradation of dichlorvos in aqueous medium. The degradation activity of the FeNPs has been investigated by the means of incubation time effect, oxidant effect, and nanoparticle concentration effect. The ammonium molybdate test was used to confirm the release of phosphate ions during the interaction of dichlorvos with FeNPs.

25418136|t|Expression of choline and acetylcholine transporters in synovial tissue and cartilage of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.
25418136|a|Increasing evidence is showing that the non-neuronal cholinergic system plays an important role in the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Choline transport into the cell is the rate-limiting step for the synthesis of acetylcholine (ACh), which can be released directly or in vesicles from the cell. However, in the human joint little is known about choline import or the release of ACh from the cell. Thus, we analyze the expression of members of the organic cation transporter (OCT), of the newly discovered choline transporter-like (CTL) family and of classical neuronal components such as the high-affinity choline transporter (CHT1) and the vesicular ACh transporter (VAChT) in the synovium and cartilage of the human hip joint from patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and RA. OCT1, OCT3 and OCTN1 and all members of the CTL family were expressed in synovial and cartilage samples. The expression of CTL1 and CTL2 was localized in synovial macrophages and fibroblasts. CHT1 mRNA expression was detectable only in the synovium, whereas VAChT was completely absent in all samples. Therefore, in the human joint, choline transport into the cell and the release of ACh seems to be mediated mainly by members of the OCT and CTL family. Expression of transporters appears not to be influenced by the pathological state, as no differences have been detected between joints from OA or RA patients. Importantly, however, all necessary components for choline import and the release of non-neuronal ACh are present in the human joint.

25395198|t|Cerium Oxide Nanoparticles Induce Oxidative Stress and Genotoxicity in Human Skin Melanoma Cells.
25395198|a|Extensive applications of cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles require a better understanding of their possible effects on human health. However, data demonstrating the effect of CeO2 nanoparticles on the human skin melanoma cell remain scanty. In the current study, we determined the mechanism through which CeO2 nanoparticles (APS <25 nm) induce toxicity in human skin melanoma cells (A375). The MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] and neutral red uptake assays showed concentration and time-dependent cytotoxicity of CeO2 nanoparticles in A375 cells. CeO2 nanoparticles significantly induced the generation reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, and decreased glutathione levels in A375 cells. It was also observed that the CeO2 nanoparticles induced chromosomal condensation and caspase-3 activity. CeO2 nanoparticles exposed cells revealed the formation of DNA double-strand breakage as measured by percent tail DNA and olive tail moment through comet assay. The decline of cell viability, production of ROS, and DNA damage in A375 cells specifies that CeO2 nanoparticles have less capable to induce cyto and genotoxicity.

26173379|t|Ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation is controlled by TOR and modulated by PKA in Candida albicans.
26173379|a|TOR and PKA signaling pathways control eukaryotic cell growth and proliferation. TOR activity in model fungi, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, responds principally to nutrients, e.g., nitrogen and phosphate sources, which are incorporated into the growing cell mass; PKA signaling responds to the availability of the cells' major energy source, glucose. In the fungal commensal and pathogen, Candida albicans, little is known of how these pathways interact. Here, the signal from phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (P-S6) was defined as a surrogate marker for TOR-dependent anabolic activity in C. albicans. Nutritional, pharmacologic and genetic modulation of TOR activity elicited corresponding changes in P-S6 levels. The P-S6 signal corresponded to translational activity of a GFP reporter protein. Contributions of four PKA pathway components to anabolic activation were then examined. In high glucose concentrations, only Tpk2 was required to upregulate P-S6 to physiologic levels, whereas all four tested components were required to downregulate P-S6 in low glucose. TOR was epistatic to PKA components with respect to P-S6. In many host niches inhabited by C. albicans, glucose is scarce, with protein being available as a nitrogen source. We speculate that PKA may modulate TOR-dependent cell growth to a rate sustainable by available energy sources, when monomers of anabolic processes, such as amino acids, are abundant.

24418208|t|Suicidal carbon monoxide poisoning using a gas-powered generator.
24418208|a|PURPOSE: The presented case deals with an unusual suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning. In a car parked in a highway rest area, the body of a middle-aged man was found. In the open trunk of the car there was a gas-powered generator which was switched on, but no longer running. The tank was three quarters full. At autopsy, bright-red livores, cherry-pink fingernails, cherry-red blood and salmon-red skeletal musculature were found. According to the toxicological analysis performed during autopsy, the COHb content in the corpse blood was 68%. METHODS: To reconstruct the event, the emergency generator was started again in the man's car. By means of measuring probes placed in the interior of the car, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and oxygen were measured and recorded in a concentration-time curve; the concentration of cyanide was measured at the end of the experiment. RESULTS: The lower explosion limit of 500 ppm CO was reached after 30s already. For technical reasons, no further values could be recorded. After about 14 min the engine started stuttering with approximately 14 vol.% of oxygen in the air, but continued to run at a lower speed until the experiment was stopped after 25 min. The final concentration of cyanide was 7.5 ppm. CONCLUSION: In view of the rapid CO increase in the interior of the vehicle it is to be assumed that the victim lost consciousness very fast.

20154027|t|Npr2, yeast homolog of the human tumor suppressor NPRL2, is a target of Grr1 required for adaptation to growth on diverse nitrogen sources.
20154027|a|Npr2, a putative "nitrogen permease regulator" and homolog of the human tumor suppressor NPRL2, was found to interact with Grr1, the F-box component of the SCF(Grr1) (Skp1-cullin-F-box protein complex containing Grr1) E3 ubiquitin ligase, by mass spectrometry-based multidimensional protein identification technology. Npr2 has two PEST sequences and has been previously identified among ubiquitinated proteins. Like other Grr1 targets, Npr2 is a phosphoprotein. Phosphorylated Npr2 accumulates in grr1Delta mutants, and Npr2 is stabilized in cells with inactivated proteasomes. Phosphorylation and instability depend upon the type I casein kinases (CK1) Yck1 and Yck2. Overexpression of Npr2 is detrimental to cells and is lethal in grr1Delta mutants. Npr2 is required for robust growth in defined medium containing ammonium or urea as a nitrogen source but not for growth on rich medium. npr2Delta mutants also fail to efficiently complete meiosis. Together, these data indicate that Npr2 is a phosphorylation-dependent target of the SCF(Grr1) E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a role in cell growth on some nitrogen sources.

16603005|t|Strong ion difference: a new paradigm or new clothes for the Acid-base emperor.
16603005|a|OBJECTIVE: To review and compare the 'metabolic' component of an acid-base abnormality by assessing the arterial blood bicarbonate and the 'strong ion difference'. DATA SOURCES: A review of published peer-review articles and studies reported from 1983 to 1999 and identified through a MEDLINE search on 'strong ion difference'. SUMMARY OF REVIEW: The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation describes the simple relationship between the arterial pH, PaCO(2) and bicarbonate concentration (HCO(3)(-)), and has been used by clinicians to classify acid-base abnormalities as either respiratory or a non-respiratory (i.e. metabolic). However, as the HCO(3)(-) concentration cannot be measured directly and as it can also be altered by an alteration in the PaCO(2), derived values such as the standard bicarbonate, buffer base, base excess and standard base excess have been proposed to assess the true 'metabolic' acid-base component. Recently, an analysis of acid-base has been reported based on the Law of electroneutrality in aqueous solutions, in which it is proposed that the independent variables of 'strong ions' (e.g. sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride and organic anions), CO(2) and non volatile weak acids (i.e. A(TOT)) alter the dependent variables of pH and HCO(3)(-). The concept of 'strong ion difference' (SID) is used to help explain 'metabolic' acid base abnormalities, particularly those associated with saline infusions. The relationship between the HCO(3)(-) ion and the SID can be represented as HCO(3)(-) = (SID - A(-)) and the Henderson Hasselbalch equation can be written as pH infinity (SID - A(.))/PaCO(2) although, the body regulates pH by regulating the PaCO(2) and HCO(3)(-), rather than by regulating the SID or A(TOT). CONCLUSIONS: In man the renal and respiratory systems regulate acid-base homeostasis by modifying the bicarbonate buffer pair (i.e. PCO(2) and HCO(3)(-)), with all other body buffer systems adjusting to alterations in this pair. To maintain electrical neutrality there is a change in cation concentration commensurate with the change in bicarbonate concentration.

11954798|t|Production of volatile compounds by cheese-ripening yeasts: requirement for a methanethiol donor for S-methyl thioacetate synthesis by Kluyveromyces lactis.
11954798|a|Five cheese-ripening yeasts (Geotrichum candidum, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kluyveromyces lactis, Yarrowia lipolytica and Debaryomyces hansenii) were compared with respect to their ability to generate volatile aroma compounds. K. lactis produced a variety of esters - ethylacetate (EA) being the major one - and relatively limited amounts of volatile sulphur compounds (VSCs). Conversely, G. candidum produced significant amounts of VSCs [with the thioester S-methyl thioacetate (MTA) being the most prevalent] and lower quantities of non-sulphur volatile compounds than K. lactis. We suspect that K. lactis is able to produce and/or accumulate acetyl CoA - a common precursor of MTA and EA - but that it produces limited amounts of methanethiol (MTL); both acetyl CoA and MTL are precursors for MTA synthesis. When supplemented with exogenous MTL, MTA production greatly increased in K. lactis cultures whereas it was unchanged in G. candidum cultures, suggesting that MTL is a limiting factor for MTA synthesis in K. lactis but not in G. candidum. Our results are discussed with respect to L-methionine catabolism.

25392513|t|White matter microstructure in transsexuals and controls investigated by diffusion tensor imaging.
25392513|a|Biological causes underpinning the well known gender dimorphisms in human behavior, cognition, and emotion have received increased attention in recent years. The advent of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging has permitted the investigation of the white matter microstructure in unprecedented detail. Here, we aimed to study the potential influences of biological sex, gender identity, sex hormones, and sexual orientation on white matter microstructure by investigating transsexuals and healthy controls using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Twenty-three female-to-male (FtM) and 21 male-to-female (MtF) transsexuals, as well as 23 female (FC) and 22 male (MC) controls underwent DTI at 3 tesla. Fractional anisotropy, axial, radial, and mean diffusivity were calculated using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and fiber tractography. Results showed widespread significant differences in mean diffusivity between groups in almost all white matter tracts. FCs had highest mean diffusivities, followed by FtM transsexuals with lower values, MtF transsexuals with further reduced values, and MCs with lowest values. Investigating axial and radial diffusivities showed that a transition in axial diffusivity accounted for mean diffusivity results. No significant differences in fractional anisotropy maps were found between groups. Plasma testosterone levels were strongly correlated with mean, axial, and radial diffusivities. However, controlling for individual estradiol, testosterone, or progesterone plasma levels or for subjects' sexual orientation did not change group differences. Our data harmonize with the hypothesis that fiber tract development is influenced by the hormonal environment during late prenatal and early postnatal brain development.

26048979|t|Salt, chloride, bleach, and innate host defense.
26048979|a|Salt provides 2 life-essential elements: sodium and chlorine. Chloride, the ionic form of chlorine, derived exclusively from dietary absorption and constituting the most abundant anion in the human body, plays critical roles in many vital physiologic functions, from fluid retention and secretion to osmotic maintenance and pH balance. However, an often overlooked role of chloride is its function in innate host defense against infection. Chloride serves as a substrate for the generation of the potent microbicide chlorine bleach by stimulated neutrophils and also contributes to regulation of ionic homeostasis for optimal antimicrobial activity within phagosomes. An inadequate supply of chloride to phagocytes and their phagosomes, such as in CF disease and other chloride channel disorders, severely compromises host defense against infection. We provide an overview of the roles that chloride plays in normal innate immunity, highlighting specific links between defective chloride channel function and failures in host defense.

11215517|t|Ferrochelatase at the millennium: structures, mechanisms and [2Fe-2S] clusters.
11215517|a|Ferrochelatase (E.C. 4.99.1.1, protoheme ferrolyase) catalyzes the insertion of ferrous iron into protoporphyrin IX to form protoheme (heme). In the past 2 years, the crystal structures of ferrochelatases from the bacterium Bacillus subtilis and human have been determined. These structures along with years of biophysical and kinetic studies have led to a better understanding of the catalytic mechanism of ferrochelatase. At present, the complete DNA sequences of 45 ferrochelatases from procaryotes and eucaryotes are available. These sequences along with direct protein studies reveal that ferrochelatases, while related, vary significantly in amino acid sequence, molecular size, subunit composition, solubility, and the presence or absence of nitric-oxide-sensitive [2Fe-2S] cluster.

3941913|t|Presence of nonoxidative ethanol metabolism in human organs commonly damaged by ethanol abuse.
3941913|a|Acetaldehyde, the end product of oxidative ethanol metabolism, contributes to alcohol-induced disease in the liver, but cannot account for damage in organs such as the pancreas, heart, or brain, where oxidative metabolism is minimal or absent; nor can it account for the varied patterns of organ damage found in chronic alcoholics. Thus other biochemical mediators may be important in the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced organ damage. Many human organs were found to metabolize ethanol through a recently described nonoxidative pathway to form fatty acid ethyl esters. Organs lacking oxidative alcohol metabolism yet frequently damaged by ethanol abuse have high fatty acid ethyl ester synthetic activities and show substantial transient accumulations of fatty acid ethyl esters. Thus nonoxidative ethanol metabolism in addition to the oxidative pathway may be important in the pathophysiology of ethanol-induced disease in humans.
